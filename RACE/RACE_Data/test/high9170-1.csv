1,C,"['he hated him', 'he was not satisfied with the food the servant prepared for him', 'he wanted to get pleasure', 'he liked to show off himself']",He played a joke on the servant because   _  .,"A young man went to a town and worked there. He did not have a wife and a servant did the work in his house.
The young man liked laughing a lot. He nailed the servant's shoes to the floor on Monday, and then laughed, because he put his feet in them and fell down.
The servant was not angry, but smiled. Then the young man put brushes in his bed on Tuesday. The servant got into bed and hit the brushes with his feet. He was afraid. The young man laughed loudly again. Again the servant was not angry, but smiled.
Then on Wednesday the young man said to his servant, ""You're a nice, kind man. I am not going to be unkind to you again.""
The servant smiled and said, ""And I'm not going to put any more mud from the street in your coffee.""",high9170.txt
