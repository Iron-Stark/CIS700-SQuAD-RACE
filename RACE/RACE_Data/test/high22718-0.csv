Her shopping had tired her and the basket had grown heavier with every step of the way home. In the lift her thoughts were on lunch and a good rest, but when she got out at her own floor, both were forgotten in her sudden discovery that her front door was open. She was thinking that she must tell her daily maid the next morning to lock the door, and then she remembered that she had gone shopping after the maid had left and she knew that she had turned both keys in their locks. She walked slowly into the hall and at once noticed that all the room doors were open, yet following her regular practice she had shut them before going out. Looking into the living room she saw a sight of confusion over by her writing desk. It was as clear as daylight then that burglars had forced into the house during her absence. Her first thought was to go round all the rooms looking for the thieves, but then she decided that at her age it might be more reasonable to have someone with her, so she went to fetch the doorman from his basement .By this time her legs were beginning to shake, so she sat down and accepted a cup of a very strong tea, while she telephoned to the police. Then her sense regained, she was ready to set off with the doorman's help to search for any thieves who might still be hiding in her flat.",high22718.txt
