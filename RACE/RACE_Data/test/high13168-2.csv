2,B,"['She was born a volleyball player.', 'She is popular with her teammates', 'She does things in an easy way.', ""She isn't the tallest but the fastest.""]",Which of the following is true about Sandra?,"It's not easy to find a person with the qualities it takes to be a hero. I didn't really understand the meaning of the word ""hero"" until my third year in the college.
If you saw her, you wouldn't think she really looks the part, but she is stronger than Superman could ever be. Her name is Sandra Keierleber. I first met her at volleyball tryouts , but didn't notice anything special at first. As the week passed, however, she showed she had more heart than anyone. She stood out because she never gave up, no matter what.
Sandra isn't the tallest or the fastest --- in fact, this was her first time playing volleyball and it showed--- but that didn't stop her. She was always the first to arrive and the last to leave. By the end of tryouts she had found a place in everyone's heart. When the name list for new members was put up, we all waited nervously as she checked. When she stood at the door and smiled happily, all we could do was cheer.
After Sandra made the team, she worked even harder to improve her game. When she asked for help, we gladly taught her. She also became our fan, attending almost every school game and even joining us in the city games. We all like her, because she never thinks about doing things the easy way, or loses that smile. Because of her great efforts, she makes herself a true hero--- and my hero, too.",high13168.txt
