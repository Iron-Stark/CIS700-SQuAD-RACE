3,A,"['Time.', 'Knowledge.', 'Richness.', 'Happiness.']",Who saved Love?,"Once upon a time, there was an island where all the feelings lived: Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all of the others, including Love. One day the feelings were told that the island would sink, so all built boats and left, except Love. Love was the only one who stayed. Love wanted to hold out  until the last possible moment.
When the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help.
Richness was passing by Love in a big boat. Love said, ""Richness, can you take me with you?""
Richness answered, ""No, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place here for you.""
Love decided to ask Vanity  who was also passing by in a beautiful ship.""Vanity, please help me!""
""I can't help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage  my boat, ""Vanity answered.
Sadness was close by so Love asked, ""Sadness, let me go with you.""
""Oh...Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!""
Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her.
Suddenly, there was a voice, ""Come, Love, I will take you.""It was an elder. So thankful and happy, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. When they arrived at dry land, the elder went her own way. Realizing how much was owed  the elder, Love asked Knowledge, another elder, ""Who helped me?""
""It was Time, ""Knowledge answered.
""Time?""asked Love.""But why did Time help me?""
Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom  and answered, ""Because only Time is able to understand how valuable Love is.""",middle139.txt
