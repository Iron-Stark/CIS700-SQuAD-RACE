2,C,"['A Musical Girl', 'Wonderful Music', 'A Special Friend in a Special Autumn', 'How to Be Friends']",What's the best title for the passage?,"It was the golden season. I could see the yellow leaves dancing in the cool wind. I felt lonely and life is uninteresting. But one day, the sound of a violin came into my ears. I was so surprised that I ran out to see where it was from. A young girl, standing in the wind, was lost in playing her violin.
I had never seen her before. The music was so wonderful that I forgot who I was.
Leaves were still falling. Every day she played the violin in the same place and I was the only listener. It seemed that I no longer felt lonely and life became interesting. We didn't know each other, but I thought we were already good friends.
One day, when I was listening, the sound suddenly stopped. The girl came over to me.
""You must like violin."" she said.
""Yes. And you play very well. Why did you stop?"" I asked.
Suddenly, a sad expression appeared on her face and I could feel something unusual.
""I came here to see my grandmother, but now I must leave. I once played very badly. It is your listening every day that has _ me."" she said.
""In fact, it is your music that has given me those meaningful days."" I answered. ""Let us be friends.""
The girl smiled and I smiled.
I never heard her play again in my life. Only thick leaves were left behind. But I will always remember the girl. She is like a dream; so short, so bright that it makes life beautiful.
There are many kinds of friends. Some are always with you, but don't understand you. Some say only a few words to you, but are close to you. I shall always think of those golden days and the girl with the violin. She will always bring back the friendship between us. I know she will always be my best friend.",middle1125.txt
