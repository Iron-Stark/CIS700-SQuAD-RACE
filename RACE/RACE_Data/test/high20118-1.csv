1,B,"['to enjoy convenience outside their home', 'for reasons of their property safety', 'not to let others know their business', 'in order to avoid being seen by burglars']",Some home-based entrepreneurs don't invite clients to their home   _  .,"You can never be too sure these days in the United States of your neighbours or even your customers! Try to keep a low profile in your neighborhood: don't announce to just about everyone that you are running a home business with thousands of dollars worth of equipment. As much as possible, don't invite clients or visitors to your home. In fact I know of some home-based entrepreneurs who would rather meet their clients in a neutral ground, e.g. the client's office or even Starbucks.
    There are other ways to keep burglars away from your house.
    *Keep lights on around your house in the evenings. Light is a natural fright for burglars.
*Invest in a security alarm, particularly if your house is located in a remote spot. Security systems can often bring down the cost of your homeowner's insurance premiums .
*Make sure that all windows and doors are locked and the security alarm turned on before you sleep at night or go out of the house. Avoid keeping house keys in obvious places, such as under the lamp or top of the doorframe.
*Adding an additional lock will provide extra security when you are home. The dead-lock, sometimes called an ""exit-only deadbolt"" is an deadbolt that doesn't have an external key. It's clearly visible on the door from the outside, but can't be broken into without destroying the door, frame, or lock itself. While the security won't help directly when you aren't home, the visibility may discourage an  _ from trying the door.
*Your door itself should be made of strong materials, such as one-inch thick solid hardwood or heavy metal.",high20118.txt
