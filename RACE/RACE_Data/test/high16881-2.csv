2,D,"['How Jewish people design and build modern sukkahs.', 'How Jewish people celebrate the holiday of Sukkot.', 'A Jewish holiday reminds people of their ancestors.', 'A Jewish tradition becomes the idea for a competition.']",What's the passage mainly about?,"Every fall, many Jewish people around the world celebrate the holiday of Sukkot  . They build huts   in their backyards, and if it is warm and dry outside, they live in those huts for seven days and nights.

He wondered what it would be like to have a competition for people around the world to use their imaginations to create modern sukkahs. It would be a design competition.

Joshua got in touch with his friend Roger Bennett. They announced the competition in May 2010. More than 600 designers sent plans. Twelve were chosen as finalists  . Then those finalists were each given money so they could build their sukkahs in a park in New York City. People building the final sukkahs were from the United States, France, England, Japan, and Germany.
More than 17,000 people voted   for the winners. At the end of the competition, the sukkahs were sold. The money was then given to a group that helps homeless people.",high16881.txt
