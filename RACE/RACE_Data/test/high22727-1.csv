High School Musical star and teen heartthrob  Zac Efron is laughing a lot these days.
  As a young boy, Efron was picked on in school because he was always the smallest in his class and teased because he had a big space between his teeth. In the sixth grade, Efron's basketball team made it to the league championships. In double overtime  , with three seconds left, he rebounded the ball and passed it to the wrong team!

  Efron was born and raised in California. He took school seriously. According to Efron, ""he would flip out if he got a B and not an A in school, and that he was a class clown."" It was his father who encouraged him to act. He took part in school performances and with a local theater group. He also took singing lessons. He graduated from high school in 2006 and was admitted to the University of Southern California to study film. But he deferred --why study movies when you can star in them.
  Now he has signed on to star in the romantic comedy Seventeen Again and to play in the remake of the hugely popular movie, Footloose. Efron is also earning more than $3 million for his role in High School Musical 3. Not bad for a 21-year-old. But Efron still remembers those bullies.
   ""You always have to remember that bullies want to bring you down because you have something that they admire,"" Efron said. ""Also, when you get made fun of, when people point out your weaknesses, it's an opportunity for you to rise above.""
