2,D,"['Because these colours can make people feel that time passes more quickly.', 'Because these colours can make people excited.', 'Because everybody likes the colour white.', 'Because people who are working can be more relaxed and calm.']",Why are offices often coloured in cool colours according to the passage ?,"People  usually  talk  about  two  groups  of  colours: warm  colours  and  cool  colours.  Scientists  think  that  there  are  also  two  kinds  of  people: people  who  prefer  warm  colours  and  people  who  prefer  cool  colours. The  warm  colours  are  red , orange  and  yellow.  Where  there  are  warm  colours  and  a  lot  of  lights , people  usually  want  to  be  active.  People  think  that  red , for  example , is  exciting . Sociable  people , those  who  like  to  be  with  others , like  red . Scientists  also  find  that  warm  colours  can  produce  a  comfortable  feeling  and  that  time  seems to pass quickly  in  a  room  with  warm  colours  than  with  cool  colours . So  a  warm  colour , such as red or orange , is a good choice for a living  room or restaurant.
The  cool  colours  are  green , blue  and  violet . These  colours , unlike  warm  colours , are  relaxing . Where  there  are  cool  colours , people  are  usually  quiet . People  who  like  to  spend  time  alone  often  prefer  blue . Cool  colours  are  better for offices because it  can make people  who  are  working  feel  relaxed  and  calm.",middle867.txt
