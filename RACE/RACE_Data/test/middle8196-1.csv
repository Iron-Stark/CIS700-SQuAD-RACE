Traditionally, there are ten best-known spots on the West Lake. They are called Ten Scenes of West Lake by Qianlong Emperor. The West Lake is divided by three causeways called Su Di, Bai Di, and Yanggong Di. First I want to tell you the history of Bai Di.
In the middle of the Tang Dynasty, Zhen yuan era(785-804), poet Bai Juyi came to Hangzhou as a governor(,). He realized that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but the old dyke had collapsed , the water of West Lake had dried out, and the local farmers suffered drought. He ordered the construction of a causeway of a stronger and taller dyke to solve the drought problem. The lives of local people improved over the following years. Then Bai Juyi had more free time to enjoy the beauty of West Lake. He visited West Lake almost every day. This causeway was later named after Bai Di in Bai Juyi's honor.
