But she had to drink it because her mom, as well as many others, said that milk was good for her growing body. Besides, milk and bread made up a convenient diet that saved her parents a lot of time after Deng entered junior school and had to arrive at school early in the morning. After that, Mengniu and Yili became her favorite brands of morning milk and yoghurt after dinner.
However, she has been forced to change her diet since the recent milk crisis. Many best-selling milk brands such as Mengniu, Yili and Bright were discovered to contain melamine  , which is usually used to make plastic. The bad milk products have sickened more than 5,300 babies and killed four.
