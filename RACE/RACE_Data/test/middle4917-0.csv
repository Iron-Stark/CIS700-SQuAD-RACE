0,C,"['It is short but carries many meanings.', 'It can help us learn the latest news.', 'It can send rumors.', 'It is easy to use.']",What is NOT an advantage   of Weibo?,"Do you know the phrase ""Weibo Addicts""  ? Do you write a Weibo? If you don't, you are ""out""!
Weibo means microblog. People may spend much time writing a blog, but it takes a little time to write a microblog. Why? Because every message on a microblog is less than 140 words.
Microblog started in the USA. It came to China in 2009 and it grows very fast. In 2011, the number of Chinese micro-bloggers grew to 300 million. People write microblogs for many reasons. For many microblog users, it is a great way of learning the freshest news, talking with friends and sharing different kinds of information, including news, everyday life, pictures, music, videos and so on.
It is easy and fast to send a message on a microblog. However, this can also bring problems and even panic  . For example, when the big earthquake and tsunami   hit Japan in March, 2011, messages like ""Salt can help people fight radiation  "" were hot on microblogs. Then a crazy buying of salt followed. Later people knew it was just a rumor  .
In a word, microblog plays a new part in the life of Chinese people.",middle4917.txt
