2,D,"['science book', 'wildlife magazine', 'guide book', 'English novel']",The passage may come from a(an)   _  .,"Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her, ""What are you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!""
Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to. She saw a little house, on the door of which was a plate with the name ""W. RABBIT"". She went in and hurried upstairs.
By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label  this time with the words' DRINK ME,' but she opened it and put it to her lips .""I know something interesting is sure to happen,"" she said to herself. Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head touching the ceiling. She went on growing and very soon had to get down on her knees on the floor. Still she went on growing, and as a last _ , she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney , and said to herself, ""Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What will happen to me?""
Luckily for Alice, she grew no longer: still it was very uncomfortable, and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.",high9374.txt
