0,C,"['In a university.', 'In a traditional classroom', 'At an apprentice program.', 'In a high school']",Where does Travis Strawderman learn?,"There's a widespread perception  in the United States that a university degree is the key to success. But a growing number of educators now say there are other possibilities, especially for students who might not succeed at university level.
This is not a traditional classroom. At the apprentice program run by the Plumbers and Steamfitters Union in the state of Maryland, Travis Strawderman and other students make money while they learn. ""I \t's completely changed my life around,"" he said. ""I've been able to pay off all my debts. I can say I'm actually responsible enough to have my own family.""
Strawderman's five-year program teaches him technical skills free of charge. He says he considered university, but it didn't interest him. Economics Professor Robert Lerman says Strawderman is not alone. ""A lot of people are bored in high school,"" Lerman stated. ""They leave high school because they are bored. They want to do something besides sitting in a classroom."" Lerman says the education system in the United States in too focused on pushing students to attend university. ""What we're doing now is we're doing now is we're saying unless you learn in this way you don't really have the chance for a rewarding career,"" he said.
But Chad Aldeman, an analyst, says studies show the longer students saty in school the better chance they have at having a high paying and stable career. ""If you only are a high school graduate your wages are going to drop over your lifetime-as opposed to a college degree,"" he said. ""The college degree is really and insurance policey against unemployment and against low wages.""",high23156.txt
