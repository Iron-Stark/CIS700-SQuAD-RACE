2,C,"['The artist', 'another man', 'the beggar', 'no one']","After the meal,   _   paid the bill.","An artist who did not have much money, but was a very kind man, was coming home by train one day. He gave his last few coins to a beggar, but then he saw another one, and forgot that he did not have any money. He asked the man if he would like to have lunch with him, and the beggar accepted, so they went into a small restaurant and had a good meal. At the end, the artist could not pay the bill, of course, so the beggar had to do so.
The artist was very unhappy about this, so he said to the beggar, ""Come home with me in a taxi, my friend, and I'll give you back the money for money.""
""Oh, no!"" the beggar answered quickly. ""I had to pay for your lunch, but I'm not going to pay for your taxi home either!""",middle183.txt
