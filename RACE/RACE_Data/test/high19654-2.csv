2,C,"['Water their lawns every three or four days.', 'Avoid watering their lawns before rainstorms.', 'Take mandatory lessons on water conservation.', 'Keep the emergency rules for water use in mind']","According to the new order, Californians should_.","California places limits on water use to deal with the state's four-year drought. Californians are feeling the heat after Governor Jerry Brown announced an order that puts mandatory  statewide water cutbacks into effect.
California has faced water-use cutbacks in the past. In January 2014, Governor Brown called for residents to curb their water use by 20 percent, but many places around the state failed to meet that goal. This most recent announcement, however, marks the first time in the state's history that mandatory restrictions have been ordered.
Most of California's water supply comes from the Sierra Nevada mountain range snowpack. Normally, during the spring and summer, this snow melts and puts new supplies into groundwater. but this past winter, the snowpack reached its lowest point since 1950. ""today we are standing on dry grass where there should be feet of snow"" announced Governor Brown.
As part of his order, Governor Brown called upon the state Water Resource Control Board to draft emergency rules for water use in the coming month. Cities and towns across the state must cut water usage by 25 percent. If city water agencies fail to meet these targets for water conservation, they could be fined $10,000 a day.
The state will also support local governments in replacing 50 million square feet of lawns with drought-tolerant plants that use less water. Outdoor lawn watering will be limited to two days per week, and residents will not be permitted to water their lawns during rainstorms and for two days afterwards. The order also asks local water agencies to raise the price of water to discourage excessive water use.
Governor Brown said change may not be easy, but it's necessary to ensure that residents can fill their water glasses into the future. ""it is a wake-up call,"" he said. ""it's requiring action and changes in behavior.""",high19654.txt
