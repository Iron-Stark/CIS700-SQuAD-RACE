When Barbra Streisand discovered in 2003 that a photograph of her California beach house was among 12,000 photos on the Internet as part of a collection by a photographer Kenneth Adelman, she did what any famous person would do: hit him with a $50 million lawsuit  . But in trying to hold back the images, she caused a different result. Her legal actions led to almost half a million people visiting the website, viewing and copying the photos within a month.
Ever since then, the effect of letting public know something you are trying to keep secret has been called the ""Streisand effect"". The problem for anyone trying to cover up information is that the Internet is the world's biggest and most useful copying machine. Put a document   on to a connected machine and it will spread. So when you want to be famous, you can't, but if you find yourself receiving too much attention and want to remove yourself, you cannot.  
There are many examples of the Streisand effect. Nine-year-old Martha Payne created a simple blog, posting the meals her school served. She took a photo of what was hardly a satisfying meal by anyone's standards. With the photo, she added a comment, ""Now Dad understands why I am hungry when I get home."" The thing did not go too far, until the local authority   banned   little Martha from doing that again. Martha posted a final post called ""Goodbye"", explaining everything. Once the media found this out, things went from bad to worse for the authority. Now the blog has more than 9.5 million page views. Martha has even expanded her blog by including pictures of school meals taken by other kids from all over the world, like Germany and Japan.
We can find similar examples throughout history. Man has experienced the Streisand effect ever since the birth of mass communication. Why does it exist? Every time you are told not to see what's in the secret shiny box wrapped in gift paper, you're going to do everything in your power to do exactly that! Just realizing that knowing something about someone is harmful to their status, we will want to know that piece of information. This is exactly the human nature. This is what lawyers and authorities should be familiar with. Unfortunately, a few of them fail to understand it.",high18859.txt
