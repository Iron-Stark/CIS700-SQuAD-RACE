   Pamela Druckerman, an American mother living in Paris, watched carefully as to why French children seem to behave so much better than American children. Let's listen to what she said.
   While eating at the restaurants in Paris, I noticed the French kids were either sitting in their chairs waiting for their food or eating fish and even vegetables, happy and satisfied. There was no shouting or crying, and there were no pieces of food around their tables. However, my 2-year-old daughter, Beth, took a brief interest in the food. She even threw food everywhere. She couldn't keep herself in her chair and ran around the table. Though by that time I'd live in France for a few months, I couldn't explain it.
   After surveying French parents, I realized that they aren't perfect, but they have some parenting secrets that do work. French parents seem to have different ideas about raising kids. One of the keys to this education is the simple act of learning how to wait. It is why the French babies I have encountered mostly sleep throughout the night from two or three months old. Their parents don't pick them up the moment they start crying, allowing the babies to learn how to fall back asleep. It is also why French kids will sit happily at a restaurant. Rather than snacking all day like American children, they mostly have to wait until mealtime to eat. French kids always have three meals a day and one snack at about 4:00 pm.",high23778.txt
