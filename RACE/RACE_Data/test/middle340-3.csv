3,C,"['Clever', 'Silly', 'Dishonest', 'Humorous']",Which word can best describe John?,"0ur village carpenter ,John Hill, came one day and made a dining table for my wife.  He made it just the right size to fill the space between the two window.  When I got home that evening, John was drinking a cup of tea and writing out his bill( ) for his job.
My wife said to me quietly, ""That's his ninth cup of tea today. ""But she said in a loud voice, ""It's a beautiful table, dear, isn't it?"" ""I'll decide about that when I see the bill,"" I said.  John laughed and gave me his bill for the work.  I read:
One dining table                 10thNovember, 2011
Cost of wood                    $ 17:00
Paint                           $1. 50
Work, 8 hours($1 an hour)          $8. 00
Total                           $36. 50
When I was looking at the bill, John said,"" It's been a fine day, hasn't it? Quite sunny. ""
""Yes,"" I said.  ""I'm glad it's only the 10thof November. ""
""Me, too,"" said John, ""you wait--it will be a lot colder by the end of the month. ""
""Yes, colder--and more expensive! Dining table will be $20 more expensive on November 30th, won't they, John?""
John looked hard at me for half a minute.  Was there a little smile in his two blue eyes? I gave his bill back to him.
""If it's not too much trouble, John,"" I said,""Please add  it up again, You can forget the date-------""
I paid him $26. 50 and he was happy to get it.",middle340.txt
