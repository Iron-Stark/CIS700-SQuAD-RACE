2,C,"['14% of people taking part in it were not affected by traffic jams.', 'Researchers used saliva to decide whether people told the truth.', 'It was carried out by a GPS company.', 'Only British people took part in it.']",What can we learn about the research?,"It seems that men are under more stress when stuck in a traffic jam than women. British researchers for the GPS company TomTom used saliva  to decide the stress levels. Levels for women were far lower than levels for men. Most of the people taking part in the research, men and women, reported that they didn't feel any stress at all. Even with that report, their saliva told a different story. In fact, people are under stress while in traffic and not even realizing it. That does not mean good things for health. People can only do something about their health if they know something is wrong.
Men are more likely to have much less patience than women. That is why their stress levels are much higher than women when they are sitting still in traffic. Men want to get where they are going now.
72% of people taking part in the research drove every day. Of course, 86% believed that traffic affected their lives in a bad way. Being stuck in traffic after a stressful day at work could raise the level to an even higher level. The more likely they are to get further stressed.
Stress from being stuck in traffic is also related to a higher chance of getting into car accidents. It is wise to avoid driving when already feeling stressed. Calm down for a few minutes, take a deep breath and drive as safely as possible. Driving with too much stress could cost you or someone else their life. It is not worth the danger. Reduce the amount of stress that you are experiencing before getting into the car and find ways to relax more when stuck in traffic. One way to relax is to have soothing music to play during these times.",high23982.txt
