3,C,"['Selfless giving is always a pleasure for a teacher.', 'An act of kindness could bring the students great joy.', 'Different students should be taught in different ways.', ""Students should learn to appreciate teachers' concern.""]",What can we learn from the text?,"My student teaching experience was a wonderful adventure. I had to deal with various discipline and behavior challenges that occurred again and again.
The greatest part of it was the relationship I developed with two students. One of the students was named Michael,whom I met when I was working for a kindergarten. Before I became a morning bus assistant, I'd heard that Michael was a challenging student who would always shout, stand up on the bus, make fun of other students, and distract bus driver. So I decided that each morning, when he got on the bus, I'd have Michael sit beside me. At first he didn't like this idea and pouted about it. But soon he settled down, knowing he had no choice. I began to talk to him about little things outside of school life, such as his weekend activities and things that he liked to do. I also listened closely to him When he talked and thoroughly responded to his ideas. As I gave Michael the attention that he needed,little by little, he began to behave better and better. His transformation was noticed by all, by the students and especially the bus driver.
Another student I took a special interest in was a boy named Tony, a third grader. To some, Tony seemed to be a slow or passive learner. So I decided to see if I could find a way to motivate Tony to stay on the task. I would sit in the seat next to him and encourage him through every step of the work he was doing. This helped him to stay motivated and at least the work was getting down on time. Before long, he was paying more attention to his studies, and scoring high on all his tests. I knew that all Tony had needed was to be motivated on a one-on-one basis.",high19223.txt
