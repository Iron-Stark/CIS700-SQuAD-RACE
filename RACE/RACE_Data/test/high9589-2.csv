2,C,"['hopeless', 'interesting', 'depressing', 'dangerous']",We can conclude from the article that the situation seemed  _  for astronauts on board the ISS when the rocket exploded.,"Six seconds after its launch in Virginia, US, an unmanned rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS) exploded, disappointing people both on Earth and in space.
Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cargo was destroyed in the Oct. 28 explosion due to An""equipment failure"", said Orbital Sciences, the company hired by NASA for the resupply mission.
The rocket was carrying a cargo ship loaded with 2,200 kilograms of supplies such as food, tools, parts, and experiments. Roughly a third of the cargo was a series of scientific investigations. Some of them were from high school students in the US. For example, 10 students from the Cristo Rey Jesuit College Preparatory School of Houston were conducting experiments about microgravity and put their samples on the rocket.  ""I know that failure is a part of science, but I really feel sorry for my students,"" science teacher Greg Adragna told the Houston,  Chronicle .
Astronauts at the ISS felt a more urgent disappointment, however. The cargo included 617kg of food. Now they will have to rely on supplies from a Russian launch on Oct. 29.
Launched in 1998 and involving the US, Russia, Canada, Japan, and the member countries of the European Space Agency, the ISS is one of the most ambitious international collaborations in history. Currently, there are six astronauts at the station, five male and one female. Three are from Russia, two are from the US, and one is from Germany.  They have lived together for about six months. The station gets regular resupplies from Earth, using unmanned spacecrafts. Food is always a big part of the supplies.  Most of the food is frozen and ready to eat, and often tastes bad-somewhat like trying to eat when you have a heavy cold.
To make space life better, however, scientists have made breakthroughs. Earlier this year, Russian astronauts managed to grow a variety of crops aboard the station. Next year they are going to try to grow rice and other plants. And, as transporting water to space is expensive, astronauts are looking for ways to recycle water. ""Astronauts on board the ISS already drink water distilled from sweat and urine<) ,"" Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported.
Is that the reason the astronauts were so disappointed not to get the water from the failed resupply mission, by any chance?",high9589.txt
