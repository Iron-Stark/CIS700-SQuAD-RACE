2,C,"['They dropped some grass seeds.', ""They didn't go out to get food any longer."", 'They began to grow plants.', 'They stayed at home and looked after their children and animals.']","When the first wheat appeared, which of the following sentences show woman's ideas had grown?","Men sometimes say: ""We are better and cleverer than women. Women never invented things. We do."" It is true that men have invented a lot of useful things: the alphabet, machines, rockets, and guns, too. But scientists and archeologists now agree that women invented one very important thing. It had changed the history. They invented agriculture.
    Before the invention of agriculture men were hunter. They went out every day. Sometimes they killed animals-sometimes animals killed them. Life was difficult and dangerous. Women had to go out every day, too. They collected roots, fruit and grass. Then, one day, more than 10,000years ago a woman dropped some grass seeds. She dropped them near her home in the Middle East. They grew--and the first wheat was born. The idea grew, too. Women planted roots and fruit trees. Then they could stay at home and look after the children and the animals. Women liked baby animals: dogs, cows, sheep and goats. That idea grew, too. Then their husbands did not have to go hunting for meat. They stayed at home. They built villages and cities. Men began civilization---after women invented agriculture.",high16776.txt
