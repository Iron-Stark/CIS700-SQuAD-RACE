1,B,"['You should follow the routine even on weekends.', 'Go to bed right after you take a hot bath.', 'The time to take exercise is important.', ""Don't take a long nap even though you are very sleepy.""]",Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?,"Nothing is more frustrating than not being able to sleep, tossing and turning  . Your mind is racing, going over everything that happened that day. Night noises keep you awake. What can you do? Here are some things you can do to help you to fall asleep.
Sleep only when sleepy
This reduces the time you are awake in bed.
If you can't fall asleep within 20 minutes, get up and do something boring until you feel sleepy.
Don't expose yourself to bright light while you are up. The light tells your brain that it is time to wake up.
Don't take naps
This will ensure that you are tired at bedtime. If you just can't make it through the day without a nap, sleep less than one hour, and take a nap before 3 p.m.
Get up and go to bed at the same time every day
Even on weekends! When your sleep cycle has a regular rhythm, you will feel better.
Regular exercise can help you sleep well, but the time to do exercise is important. Exercising in the morning or early afternoon will not interfere   with sleep.
Have a snack before bedtime
If your stomach is too empty, that can interfere with sleep. However, if you eat a heavy meal before bedtime, that can interfere as well. Have a warm glass of milk.
Take a hot bath 90 minutes before bedtime
A hot bath will raise your body temperature, but it is the drop in body temperature that may make you feel sleepy.",high1431.txt
