1,A,"['a lot', 'little', 'few', 'slowly']",People's living conditions have improved   _  in Beijing.,"It's the second time for me to come to Beijing. There are many places of interest in Beijing, such as the Summer Palace, the Great Wall, etc. What's more, I think great changes have taken place in Beijing. People's living conditions have improved a lot. Their life is very happy. Almost everyone has a big smile on the face. People in Beijing are in high spirits and hard-working. Children can receive a good education.
