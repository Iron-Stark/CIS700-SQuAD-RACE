2,B,"['they are dealing with the problems', 'the people and things they get used to are around them', 'someone they loved has recently died', 'their parents are getting divorced']",Kids won't feel homesick when   _  .,"When you sleep somewhere else--like at summer camp or a friend's house--you know you're in for a fun time. It can be exciting to get away from the same old bed in the same old room in the same old house. But fun as this is, for some kids being away from home can be scary and sad. They want to go and have fun with their friends, but once they're there, they start to miss their good old bed, their good old parents, and all that everyday stuff at home. It's called being homesick.
Homesick means you're upset, sad, and maybe scared. But don't feel surprised. A lot of people get homesick, even grownups. When you're used to having certain people and things around you, it can be scary when they're gone. When you're dealing with other problems, you will feel homesick, too. Some kids may feel more homesick than usual if their parents are getting divorced or if someone they loved has recently died.
Here are some ideas to help you feel less homesick.
Bring a little bit of home with you. If you're going away from home, bring your pillow or pictures of the people you'll be apart from and look at them any time you want.
Keep busy. The more fun stuff you do, the less time you'll have to feel homesick. Try to join in activities wherever you are.
Stay in touch. You can make a plan for when you'll call your mom or dad. You can also email or text message to stay in touch with family and friends. When you do get in touch with someone, make sure to talk about the fun things you're doing!
Talk to someone where you are. Maybe you can tell a friend that you feel homesick. He or she might have some ideas to help you feel better.",high7864.txt
