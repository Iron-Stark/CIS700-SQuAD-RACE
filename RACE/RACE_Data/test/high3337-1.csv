1,D,"['The couple in the cabin.', 'Emergency officials.', 'Volunteers.', 'Himself.']",Who saved Austin according to his father?,"A 16-year-old South Dakota boy who became lost while hunting and spent 16 hours alone in the Black Hills National Forest says he was scared but still managed to make a survival plan.
Austin DuVall, of Rapid City, became lost on Nov.3 while hunting with his father. He ran after a deer, and soon found himself alone. ""I ran after a deer, but I didn't get it,"" he said. ""Then I was really lost.""
He had only his hunting rifle  and the clothes he was wearing. He had no food or water and had nothing that could help him find his way to safety. ""I knew that no one could hear me. I decided to just sleep and get up in the morning and find safety,"" he said.
Austin climbed up on a rock and slept through the night. Then he awoke and relied on skills he learned in a hunter safety course. He followed a stream to an occupied cabin. The couple there called his parents and cooked him a breakfast. "" It's probably one meal I'll never forget for the rest of my life,"" he said.
After DuVall's disappearance, a lot of emergency officials and more than 100 volunteers went searching for him. ""He wasn't sitting there waiting for someone to come and find him,"" said his father, Steve DuVall. ""We didn't find him; he found himself.""
Mike Kintigh, regional supervisor for the Game, Fish & Parks Department, said one or two hunters will go missing each year, but rarely for more than 24 hours. ""We're a little bit unique in the Black Hills as it's hard to get lost for a very long time. That's because we've got so many roads here compared to the Rocky Mountains,"" Kintigh said. ""You can certainly spend a very uncomfortable night in the woods like Austin did.""",high3337.txt
