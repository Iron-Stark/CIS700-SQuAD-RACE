Having undergone a lot of sufferings and frustrations , he walked the streets , feeling desperate .
On that same night , I was sitting in my room when I heard the doorbell rang . My mom opened the door , finding herself face-to-face with a very disheveled-looking man , Mark , with tears running down his face . My mom , overcome by pity , invited him inside .
Curious , I went downstairs to get a better look . The sight of the man , holding his head in his hands and crying , made my chest ache . I raced back upstairs to my room , pulled out my only half-dollar coin from my money jar and ran back downstairs .
When I reached the door of the living room , I walked right in and quickly made my way over to the stranger . I put the half-dollar in his hand and told him that I wanted him to have it . Then I gave him a hug and turned and ran as fast as I could out of the room and back up the stairs .
Downstairs , tears streamed down Mark's face as he tightly held that coin . Finally he said , "" It's just that I thought nobody cared . For the last twenty years , I have been so alone . That was the first hug I have gotten . It's hard to believe that somebody cares . ""
Before Mark left , my parents asked him why he had knocked on our door , Mark said that as he was walking the streets that rainy night , hope. less and ready to die , he noticed a bumper sticker on our car reading SOMEBODY LOVES YOU .
It's hard to imagine that a bumper sticker and fifty cents could change a person's life . Mark's life did change that night . When he left our house , he was ready to live instead of die .",high12779.txt
