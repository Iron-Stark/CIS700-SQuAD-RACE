2,B,"['Six.', 'Seven.', 'Eight.', 'Nine.']",How many children are there in Joseline Ntunzusenimanima's home?,"On my first holiday in America, I went to a large supermarket to buy breakfast. And although this was an English-speaking country that I knew well through films and TV, I was amazed. Everything came in unfamiliar   packaging  ,with things I'd never heard of, Even things as simple as corn chips were strange, in different colours including black and purple.
Tilse, who works for Nutrition Australia, first realized there was a problem six years ago. After teachers at her children's school quietly shared their opinions about the diets, she knew something about it. ""They cared for what many children were  bringing to school for lunch,"" she said. ""Mostly packaged foods, such as chips are not healthy.""
Tilse said, ""They've managed to escape war areas and get to Australia, only to face the very real risk of running into heart disease. All because they're making wrong choices about food.""
""Before I came to Australia, I'd never seen a sandwich,"" said Joseline Ntunzusenimanima, a 33-year-old mother of seven from Burundi in East Africa. ""There were so many fruits I had either never seen or not been able to buy for many years. I was in shock for the first four days after I arrived. I didn't know what to do or where to go because I was just amazed to see plenty of food, peace and safety.""",middle8212.txt
