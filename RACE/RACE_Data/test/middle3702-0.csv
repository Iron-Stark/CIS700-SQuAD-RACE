The farmer put on a pair of wrong shoes-one with a thick sole  and the other with a thin one. So as he began to walk, he felt very uncomfortable. When he was just out of the house, he turned to his daughter and said, ""Why should one of my legs be longer than the other today?""
The daughter looked at his father's legs carefully as he was walking, and then laughed, ""Oh, no, Daddy, your legs are all right. You have put on the wrong shoes.""
The farmer was very happy to hear that and said to himself, ""What a clever daughter I have got!"" Then he asked his daughter to go back and get the other pair of shoes for him.
The farmer had only two pairs of shoes.
When the daughter ran back to the house, she found that the other pair was also a pair of wrong shoes.
She had to return to his father with nothing in her hands and said out of breath, ""It's no use changing them, Daddy! The shoes at home were not a pair, either!""",middle3702.txt
