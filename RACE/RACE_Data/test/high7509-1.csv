""There has been a lot of evidence about dogs barking or birds migrating before volcanic eruptions or earthquakes. But it has not been proven,"" said Matthew van Lierop, an animal behaviour specialist at Johannesburg Zoo.
""There have been no specific studies because you can't really test it in a lab or field setting,"" he said.
Other authorities agreed with this conclusion.
""Wildlife seem to be able to pick up certain phenomenon, especially birds. There are many reports of birds detecting coming disasters,"" said Clive Walker, who has written several books on African wildlife.
