1,C,"['China Pavilion.', 'the Oil Pavilion.', 'the South Korea Corporate Pavilion.', ""I don't know.""]",In which pavilion can we see the snow during this hot summer?,"Zhao Tao, a student from No.2 Middle School, has just come back from Shanghai. This morning, he told us something about his pleasant trip .When he talked about the Shanghai World Expo, he was so excited and so proud that he kept telling about it for several hours. The Shanghai World Expo held by China has been on for more than one month .It started on May 1st, and will end on October 31st, 2010. Its main idea is ""Better City, Better Life."" About 242 countries and organizations are attending this expo. Many new products can be seen here, such as we can see the snow in the South Korea Corporate Pavilion  every day during this hot summer though it seldom snows in Shanghai. And we can see, hear, touch and smell the 4-D films at the Oil Pavilion. How wonderful all these new products are!
China Pavilion is in the center of the expo garden. It is very beautiful. It represents the development of China from ancient time to now. It's a pride of our China!
Thousands of people from all over the world are coming to the expo every day. And many volunteers are working for them. All the tourists are very pleased and they say that the Shanghai World Expo is the greatest one in the world so far.
However, Zhao said, ""The expo garden is now so crowded. If you want to visit it, you'd better go there during the summer vacation.""",middle7896.txt
