4,A,"['Because the servant showed kind and nice behaviour to him', 'Because the servant told him the truth', 'Because he wanted to be a good man', 'Because his father told him to do so']",Why did the young man stop playing jokes on the servant?,"A young man went to a town and worked there. He did not have a wife and a servant did the work in his house.
The young man liked laughing a lot. He nailed the servant's shoes to the floor on Monday, and then laughed, because he put his feet in them and fell down.
The servant was not angry, but smiled. Then the young man put brushes in his bed on Tuesday. The servant got into bed and hit the brushes with his feet. He was afraid. The young man laughed loudly again. Again the servant was not angry, but smiled.
Then on Wednesday the young man said to his servant, ""You're a nice, kind man. I am not going to be unkind to you again.""
The servant smiled and said, ""And I'm not going to put any more mud from the street in your coffee.""",high9170.txt
