Can kids make their own newspapers? They do in Paris. Student editors  at a French newspaper for kids called ""Mon Quotidien"", do every day.
The 10-year-old newspaper has its headquarters   in Paris. Sometimes the newspaper sells 200,000 copies every day. It gets more than one million dollars every year! This is much more than other newspapers.
How do they decide what to put in the paper? All the adult editors working on the children's daily agree that the paper should be easy and simple to read. Kids should be able to finish it within 10 minutes.
The paper covers school life, animals, and science, which are usually kid's favourite subjects. It also talks about big world problem, like the Iraq   war.
In order to make the paper more popular with kids, adult editors invite students from age 10 to 15 to take part in their meetings. They have meetings every Wednesday and Sunday. Adult editors, reporters and kids sit together and decide which topics should come out in the paper and on which page.
Which topic should come out on the front page, European Union   or bears in the zoo? Often the kid editors and adult writers disagree. Sometimes, the adult editors have to give up because their little editors won't give in.
Usually the student editors stay in the newspaper office for three hours at each meeting. Any kid in France can call the newspaper if they are interested in being a one-day editor.",middle6794.txt
