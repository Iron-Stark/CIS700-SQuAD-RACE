0,D,"['Huang Qin .', 'Zheng Yuanjie.', 'Guo Yan.', 'Star Dream Factory']",Pipilu Sending You 100 Lives has been adapted into a play by   _  .,"The best selling children's book, Pipilu Sending You 100 Lives, has been adapted into a homonymous play that will be put on for the first time next March and tour around 50 cities in China.
The book was adapted by the Hangzhou based Star Dream Factory.
""We don't want to descend to the average children's dramas that are overly eager to please the kids,"" said Huang Qin, director of Star Dream Factory. ""We want to provide something practically useful and mystically entertaining.""
The original book by Chinese children's book writer Zheng Yuanjie focuses on safety tips for kids. With Zheng's usual _ and simplicity, the book avoids sugar-coating reality. Instead, it illustrates the potential dangers in everyday life and provides possible solutions.
Zheng recalled that when he saw his new-born baby in the hospital, the first thought that hit him was to do his utmost to guarantee his son's safety.
""Safety is of the greatest importance to a human being,"" said Zheng. ""If the person is gone, nothing else will matter.""
According to Zheng, there is no preaching or soapboxing in his book. He said that he just wanted to talk and tell the plain truth to the children in an easily understandable way.
This line of thought will be echoed in the theatrical reproduction, said director Guo Yan. She also said that the play will place emphasis on multimedia effects and the interaction with the families.
""Theatre may not ensure the children a path to professional esteem and better jobs in society, but it does have the power to give them strength (at heart),"" said Huang Qin.
Huang also calls for consistent attention to child safety, pointing out the lack of universal education and effective legal channels.
The show is expecting an estimated audience of more than 100,000 people during its domestic tour in the upcoming year.",high9184.txt
