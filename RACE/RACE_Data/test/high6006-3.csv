3,A,"['How to Make Friends', 'Teachers Can Make Friends with Students', 'A Friend in Need Is a Friend Indeed', 'How to Be Friends with New Comers']",What is the best title for this passage?,"Have you ever heard the saying "" _ ""?
Here is how a new teacher made friends with the girls and boys in her class on the first day of school. As the bell rang, the teacher smiled at each girl and boy. Then she said in a quiet voice, ""Good morning. How nice it is to have all of you in my class this year. I'd like to know each of you. I am sure we will enjoy working together."" Everyone felt that she meant what she said because of her sweet voice and her friendly look.
She told the girls and boys her name and wrote it on the blackboard. Then she told them some of the things she liked to do and she was hoping to do with them during the year.
Then she said to the class, ""Now you know my name and the things I like and I want to know your names and the things you like. Then I will feel that I know you.""
Could you make friends by doing the same as this teacher did?
One way of getting to know girls and boys in your class is to find out more about them. It is often easy to be friends with those people who have the same hobbies with you. You play the same games and go on journeys together.
You may find that some new comers in your class miss their old friends and feel strange and lonely. You can invite them to take a walk or to ride bikes with you. You will find many things in common to talk about. Just talking together in a friendly manner is one good way to make friends.",high6006.txt
