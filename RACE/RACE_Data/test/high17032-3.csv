Knowing how to make an invisible ink message will have you feeling like a secret agent in no time. These are instructions for making invisible ink using baking soda.
Difficulty: Easy
Time required: A few minutes 
What you need:
Baking soda, Paper, Water, Light bulb, Paintbrush, Measuring cup, Purple grape juice
Here's how:
There are at least two methods of using baking soda as invisible ink. Mix equal amounts of water and baking soda.
Use a paintbrush to write a message onto white paper, using the baking soda solution   as ""ink"".
Allow the ink to dry.
One way to read the message is to hold the paper up to a heat source, such as a light bulb. The baking soda will cause the writing in the paper to turn brown.
The second way to read the message is to paint over the paper with purple grape juice. The message will appear in a different color1.
Tips:
If you are using the heating method, avoid burning the paper.
Baking soda and grape juice react in an acid-base   reaction, producing a color1 change in the paper.
Grape juice concentrate   results in a more visible color1 change than regular grape juice.",high17032.txt
