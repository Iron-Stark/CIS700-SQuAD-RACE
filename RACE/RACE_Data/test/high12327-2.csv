2,B,"['there will be no insects at all.', 'they are sure to take some medicine on the trip.', 'the two friends will take turns to drive.', 'the two friends will share a suitcase.']",It is quite clear that   _  .,"In most of the time, I am devoted to my research in the lab with my friend Dave, who loves traveling very much. To make our life colorful and relax ourselves, in July, my friend and I are taking a camping trip. We will travel for four weeks and will tour the United States and part of Canada. We have decided to camp because it does not cost as much as vacationing   in hotels.
We have to plan very carefully in advance. First, the car we are going to drive is very small, so we have decided to take only one small suitcase each and as few camping things as possible. We will take some medicine with us to prevent insects   from hurting us, and also food for picnics. Second, there is a lot to see in the United States and Canada, so we have to decide on the direction   we want to drive.
The date we are leaving is July 2, from which day we will have two months off.  We want to see and do many things on our camping tour. We want to climb in the mountains, visit famous caves, and swim in cool mountain rivers. We want to visit many cities and talk to many people, which I am sure can enrich our experience greatly. We also want to find a hotel room if it rains at night. We expect to have an exciting trip.",high12327.txt
