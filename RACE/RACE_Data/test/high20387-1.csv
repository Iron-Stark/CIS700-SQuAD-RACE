Some braves gathered beside a smoking campfire. Murmuring sounds could be heard as they talked quietly. Women nervously performed their domestic tasks, preparing a small meal. Several sad, old men sat mute, their morale very low.
The camp was pitched at the edge of a deep valley--so deep that one could barely see the calm water at the bottom. The Indians had been taken by surprise and were surrounded and attacked by enemy forces. They fought bravely, but they were degraded by defeat. Their homes were destroyed. Those who had survived had been pursued by the enemy. The chase  had lasted for days. Persuaded by their leaders to press on, they had made a wrong turn. Their  _ journey ended at the edge of a valley--a desperate situation. Before them was a great hole in the earth. Behind them was the enemy. No wonder they were frozen with fear. Where could they go?
Just when no choice seemed available to them, several young braves ran into camp. With great excitement they reported seeing a stone bridge across the valley, just a short distance from camp. Most of the tribe discounted this wild story. However, a few hurried to the spot to see for themselves. Seeing was believing! Indeed there was a stone bridge, great enough to accommodate many people and their horses. Without hesitation the people gathered up their children and the belongings they had and hurried across the bridge.
Enemy braves watched from a nearby cliff. It was obvious that the Great Spirit was on the side of the defeated. The enemy did not follow. Safe on the other side of the valley, the wanderers thanked the Great Spirit for providing the vital link. They had escaped their enemies. 
For hundreds of miles around, Indian people heard about the miraculous stone bridge. From this incident it was clear that the Great Spirit defends weak people. Many came from near and far to see the magnificent stone bridge. You, too, can see this bridge and even ride across it in a car--in southwestern Virginia.",high20387.txt
