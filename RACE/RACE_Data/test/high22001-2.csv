2,C,"['teenagers are practical', 'teenagers are lazy-bones', ""it's based on their body development"", ""it's good for their learning and health""]",Foster's opinion on teenagers' getting up late is that   _  .,"Dr. Paul Kelly, head of Monkeseaton Community High School in North Tyneside, said it would mean the end of sleeping in lessons before lunch, after experiments showed teenagers could have different body clocks from adults and younger children.
Russell Foster, an Oxford professor of neuroscience  , tested the memory of 200 Monkseaton pupils at 9 am and 2 pm using pairs of words, and discovered a 9% improvement in the afternoon. Students correctly identified 51% of word pairs in the latest session, compared with 42% in the morning. Tayler McCullough, 15, one of the test subjects, said the majority of students would welcome the extra hours in bed, ""I'm extremely hard to get up in the morning. One or two people like to get to school early, but most of us would be up for going in later. I'm sure it would make a big difference to our learning ability.""
Kelly is  _ that a change of school timetable will have a meaningful effect on exam performance. He wants his school's governors to approve his plan and put the new time-table in place before the opening of Monkseaton's new timetable in place before the opening of Monkseaton's new school building, the most technologically advanced in the country, in September.
Kelly hopes his latest idea will be just as successful. ""We have to be practical. But this proves that, by starting later, children's learning improves, as does their health.""
Foster said, ""This is preliminary   data, but what's exciting is that it matches more detailed studies carried out in Canada and the US. Teenagers get up late not because they are lazy but because they are biologically programmed to do so.""",high22001.txt
