0,C,"['a primary school', 'a secondary school', 'a small lake', 'a shopping mall']",There is  _  in the centre of the town.,"Hello! My name is Kitty. I want to talk about my home town today.
My home town is small but pretty. It's about two hours away from London by train. In the centre of the town there is a small lake. There are lots of trees and flowers around the lake. My parents often walk around the lake at the weekend. The air in my home town is very fresh   and clean.
There are two schools in my home town, one primary school and one secondary school. I study in the secondary school and my younger sister studies in the primary school. I often ride my bike to school.
I usually go to the youth centre to learn drawing with my sister on Friday afternoons. I like going shopping at the weekend. There are two big shopping malls there.[:Zxxk.Com]",middle4811.txt
