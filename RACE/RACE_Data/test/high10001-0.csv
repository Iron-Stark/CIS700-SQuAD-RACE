""Honey, you don't look fat in that, no."" But another study showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.

We explain it, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because we don't understand the gaps between ideals and realities in our lives.

By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world to be breadwinners, we've entered a world that is just full of fake digital friends, business media, identity thieves, world-class cheats, ----in short, a post-truth society.
What do you do? Well there are steps we can take to guide our way through the bushes. Trained lie spotters get to the truth 90% of the time. The rest of us, we're only 54% accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are clever liars and stupid liars. There're no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes. We all use the same techniques.",high10001.txt
