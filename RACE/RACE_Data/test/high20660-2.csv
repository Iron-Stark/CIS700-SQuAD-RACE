2,B,"['the total pedestrian casualty rate has fallen', 'careless parking may cause serious traffic accidents', 'the convenience of motorists in general matters much', 'the safety of pedestrians matters lithe']",What Mr.A.Walker does want to make known in his letter is that  _  .,"Sir,
    The majority(=Most) of your readers must have been surprised and shocked to read a letter from Mr.R.Hogg,published in last Wednesday's Herald.Mr.Hogg seems to think that his own convenience and that of motorists in general are the only things that matter in our city.
    I would have supported Mr.Hogg if he had just made suggestions to improve the situation.No doubt his problems would be partly solved if the local government built a multi-storey car park in the city center,instead of encouraging motorists to use public transport.All the same,judging from the tone of Mr.Hogg's letter,I suspect that motorists who are so careless of pedestrians' safety that they would rather park their ears on the pavement than hold up the traffic would probably be too lazy to use a multi-storey car park if they had to walk a few hundred yards to their destination afterwards.
    My main reason for writing,however,is much more important.Does Mr.Hogg realize that,according to figures  showed by the Department of Transport,13,000 people were knocked down in Britain last year because of ears being illegally parked either on the pavement or on crossings? In fact,although the total pedestrian casualty  rate has fallen over the last ten years,there has been an increase in accidents caused when pedestrians have to step out into the mad to avoid parked cars on the pavement and cannot see oncoming traffic.
    I cannot share Mr.Hogg's view that the government have paid little attention to""long-suffering motorists"":and I think the punishment for dangerous parking should be made severe enough to stop all motorists from breaking the law in this way.
