0,B,"['Everyone dreams but very few can recall what they dream.', 'Some people have long dreams and others have very short ones.', 'People can only remember unpleasant dreams.', 'More than eighty percent of people can remember their dreams.']",Which of the following statements about dreams is TRUE?,"It's a fact that we all dream. Some dreams seem to last for hours, others only for seconds. Some of us have strange dreams, some have interesting dreams, and some of us have unpleasant dreams. Tests in the 1980s showed that these dreams occur within 90-minute cycles, each cycle made up of six stages. In the last stage people experience rapid eye movement, known as REM, and it is in this stage that dreaming takes place. Eighty percent of people who were woken during this sixth stage could easily remember their dreams. On the other hand, when during the first five stages (NREM), only seven percent could describe a dream.
However, of these same people woken during the first five stages, 74% were able to remember thinking activity, although they would not call it a dream. NerysDee, who has written about dreams in a book called ""Your Dreams and What They Mean"" says: ""Perhaps during NREM sleep we are sorting out our outer mundane problems, but in REM sleep we are dealing with inside matters."" She also makes the following statement about 90-minute cycle: It may also prove the reason why _ who wake in the middle of the night find it impossible to get to sleep again for at least an hour and a half. In other words, until they have missed out one complete 90-minute sleep period.",high5942.txt
