2,A,"['Be Well Prepared for Outdoor Activities.', 'Pay Attention to Unexpected Accidents.', 'Do Take Outdoor Activities in a Group.', 'Be Sure to Avoid Being Injured When Traveling.']",Which of the following can be used as the best title?,"As winter gives way to spring, students feel like taking outdoor activities. However, do remember that accidents can happen, such as the one that happened at Taihu Lake several weeks ago. Four students from Shanghai were killed and several were injured. There were several reasons for the accident, but if the students had worn life jackets, it would have made a big difference.
Therefore, it is important to take steps to avoid accidents before going on trips whether on land or water. Here are some steps:
Make sure you are physically fit for any activities. You need energy for hiking or boating after a long inactive winter.
Research your route  . Check the weather report so you can pack the correct things so that an unexpected downpour or high winds won't destroy your day.
If you are visiting a different culture, learn some basic knowledge about what's accepted and what is not.
Take plenty of water to prevent your body from losing too much water and be sure to wear the correct footwear to protect your feet. Don't go to faraway areas and never risk going into unknown waters.
Going in a group is safer than going alone. If you have to travel by yourself, leave a note of your travel route, telephone number and how you are traveling. So if there's an emergency, people can get in touch with you.",high21694.txt
