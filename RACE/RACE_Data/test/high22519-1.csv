1,A,"['Parents.', 'Teachers.', '1he pubic.', 'Some organization.']","In the writer's opinion, who should help children avoid the harmful information on the Internet?","The Internet has become a part of our everyday life and there is nothing we can do without it.It is a means of communication as well as a good way of relieving and having fun.No matter in what place of the world,the Internet is the same for every one of us.
    If we hope to improve our knowledge or look for a certain piece of information, the Internet is the perfect tool for our need.If we do not have the time to shop, ordering online is the solution to our problem.The Internet is very useful to most  people.
    There is no doubt that the Internet also has some bad points.I'm speaking about the harmful information,which may come up in the most unexpected paces.You can sometimes come across violence,presented to the public as a very normal way of expressing beliefs.An intelligent person will always be able to tell apart right and wrong, but what can we do to help the teenagers and children? This sort of information is a cause of many of the violent incidents in schools.
    There are few organization that monitor the Internet and the information on it.They cannot possibly get rid of all the bad things on the Internet.
    So should the Internet be censored for the protection of children? My belief is that parents are the ones who should be to blame for what their children ale doing on the Internet.",high22519.txt
