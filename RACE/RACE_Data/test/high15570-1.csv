to a child's normal development.
It's estimated that 75 percent of very young children in the United States live in homes where the television is on most of the time,even though the kids often aren't watching it. The University of Massachusetts researchers recently studied how TV background noise might affect young children. The study looked at 50 1,2and 3yearolds. Each child came to a lab with a parent and was allowed to play for an hour with various toys. For half the time,a television was on in the room,showing the adult game show as well as advertisements. During the other half hour,the TV was turned off.
As expected,the children paid little attention to the adult television show,glancing at it for less than a few seconds at a time,and less than once a minute. Even so,the distraction   of the background noise had a significant effect on how children at every age played. When the television was on,the children played with each toy for far shorter periods of time,and focused attention during play was also shorter compared to how they played when the TV was off.
Researchers said that even though the children aren't interested in the show,background TV affects their ability to do various types of play. The finding is important because many wellmeaning parents who wouldn't let their young children watch television may not realize that even adult programs that don't interest children still can have an effect.
