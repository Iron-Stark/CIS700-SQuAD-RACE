 Here he was in England. Now a famous man, he was rich. He knew many important people. Wherever he went, people knew his name. They wanted to hear his music. As he played the sad, slow songs, Louis thought of his home in New Orleans. He lived there as a boy. It was a busy, exciting city. But Louis's family was very poor. He went to work to help his mother. He also went to school. One of Louis's teachers asked him to join the school band. ""This horn is yours until you leave our school,"" his teacher said. Louis's music was jazz and he loved it. He remembered all the music he heard. He didn't learn to read music until he was a man. 
 When he left school, he played on many bands. He loved his work and people loved him. They knew that he had a wonderful talent. Louis played in little towns and in big cities. Armstrong's horn had as many sounds as ten horns--sometimes slow and sometimes sweet; sometimes fast and hot, high and low. His music was always strong and exciting. ""He does make wonderful music,"" said the man who listened happily. ""Yes,"" said another man, ""he makes that horn speak. ""
