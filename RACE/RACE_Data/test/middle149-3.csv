3,A,"['John and his sister are both', 'John is', ""John's sister is"", 'Michael is']",_  in Grade One now.,"Dear John, Thank you very much for your letter. I am glad that you enjoyed your holiday with me. We enjoyed having you and your sister here. We hope that you will both be able to come again next year. Perhaps you'll be able to stay longer next time you come. A week is not really long enough, is it? If your school has a five-week holiday next year, perhaps  you'll be able to stay with us for two or three weeks.
We have been back at school three weeks now. It feels like three months! I expect  that you are both working very hard now that you are in Grade One. I shall have to work hard next year when I am in Grade One. Tom and Ann won't be in Grade One until 2011.
They went for a picnic yesterday but I didn't go with them because I cut my foot and I couldn't walk very well. They went to an island and enjoyed themselves. Do you still remember the island? That's where all five of us spent the last day of our holiday.
Tom, Ann and I send our best wishes to Betty and you. We hope to see you soon.
Yours sincerely,
Michael",middle149.txt
