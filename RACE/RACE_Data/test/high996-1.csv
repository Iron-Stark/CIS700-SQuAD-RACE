As he got closer, hesaw that it was a young man and the young man wasn't dancing, but instead he wasreaching down to the shore, picking up something and throwing itinto the ocean. As he got closer, he called out, ""Good morning! What are youdoing?''
Theyoung man paused, looked up and replied, ""Throwingstarfishes in theocean.""
""I guess I should have asked, why are you throwing starfishes in the ocean?""
""The sun is up and the tide is going out.And if I don't throw them in, they'll die"".
""But, young man, don't you realize thatthere are miles and miles of beach and starfishes all along it. You can'tpossibly make a difference!""
Theyoung man listened politely. Then he bent down, picked another starfish andthrew it into the sea, and said, ""It made a difference for that one.""Thereis _ in each and every one of us. We have all beengifted with the ability to make a difference. And if we can know that gift, wewill gain through the strength of our vision of the power toshape the future.
We musteach find our starfish. And if we throw our starfish wisely and well, the worldwill be better.",high996.txt
