2,B,"['He lives alone with his father.', 'He has a very rich father', 'He often feels very lonely.', 'He is a rap star.']",What do we learn about Eric from the passage?,"A few years ago, I moved into a new house in Los Angeles. Soon after, a family moved in next door. It wasn't the best of times for me. I had just divorced  from my second wife, and I wasn't working. I'd come home each day and sit by myself in the backyard. One night, I heard someone from the yard next door, ""Tom ! How are you, Tom? ""
I couldn't see anybody through the trees, but I answered, ""I' m good.""
""Good!"" said the voice.
""What's your name?"" I asked.
""Eric."" Then I heard someone say, ""Eric, don't bother him.""
""Okay!"" Eric said. ""Talk to you tomorrow!""
Months later, on Halloween, we finally met face to face. Eric came to the door dressed like a rap star. We became friends. We'd hang out in our yards, and Eric, who was almost 17 at the time and look liked a 13-year-old, would tell me his ideas and dreams. Eric's dad, Alec Gores, is a billionaire , the head of Gores Technology Group.
One day, Alec called me and said, ""I know you are an actor. My son's an actor, too. And he's very good. I want you to write a movie for him. He wants to do something like True lies."" That's the movie I made in 1994. His father has given Eric the great gif of confidence. He believes he can do anything he wants. He also offered to fund the movie. And that's how The Kid & I, which opens in November, began.
Well, I really have to say that opportunity lies anywhere.",high15407.txt
