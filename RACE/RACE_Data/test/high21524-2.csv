2,C,"['5', '18', 'About 23', 'About 27']",How old may Miss Lund be now?,"Having spent five years searching for her older brother, Miss Lund was unbelievable to think she had been working in the same building for five months.
         Mr.Philips, 33, and Miss Lund last saw each other almost twenty years ago after their father, also called Stephen, 56, lost contact with his son from a previous relationship.Miss Lund, only five at that time, moved to India with her father and mother Rose, while Steven lived with his mother in Wolverhapton.
    By the time Miss Lund and her parents returned to Leeds, the family had lost all contact with Mr.Philips.On turning 18, Lund started to track down her long-lost half brother, even asking customers at the shop where she worked.But despite checking on Internet sites such as Friends Reunited and MySpace, it wasn't until the pair started working together at Loop Customer Management where she went on asking everyone if they knew a Stephen Philips that she tracked him down in March, 2007.
    She couldn't believe it when she was told someone by that name worked there.After she checked on the Internet database, it suggested he wasn't her brother as his name Steven instead of Stephen.Then a friend came up to her and said Steven's surely her brother.They checked parents' names and it turned out they were related.She wanted to scream but they were at work so they just hugged and chatted.
    Mr.Philips, a father of four children, said he was delighted, adding: ""I never thought we would meet again.I can't wait to get to know my sister.We have so much to know.""",high21524.txt
