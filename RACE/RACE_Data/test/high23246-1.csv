1,C,"['more children will be at risk of tobacco addiction', 'it will bring inconvenience to its consumers', 'young smokers will be discouraged', 'many vending machines will be left unused']",The tobacco industry may be against the new regulation because   _,"Children will find it more difficult to buy cigarettes as vending machines selling tobacco will be officially banned in England today.According to the British Heart Foundation(BHF),around 200,000 young people start smoking regularly in England each year and 11 per cent of l1-to15-year-old regular smokers in England and Wales get their cigarettes from vending machines.
    Betty McBride, Director of Policy and Communications at the British Heart Foundation,said,""Thousands of children who are at risk of addiction regularly get tobacco from these machines,which of course,don't ask them to prove their age.With the tobacco industry increasingly depending on young smokers to keep their profits,they're fighting tooth and nail to stop any changes that might hit their bottom line.""
