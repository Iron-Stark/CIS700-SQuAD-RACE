3,C,"['got off the train to avoid meeting an ex-neighbor.', 'went with an ex-neighbor to spend holiday at the seaside*', 'tried to get away from an ex-neighbor but did not succeed*', 'was surprised to meet his ex--neighbor in a small hotel*']",This story is about a man who_.,"As the train approached the seaside town where I was going to spend my holiday, I went into the corridor  to stretch  my legs.I stayed there for a short while,breathing in the fresh air and exchanging a few words with one of the passengers,whom I had met earlier on the station platform.
   When I turned to go back to my seat,I happened to glance into the compartment next to mine.Sitting there was a man who many years before had been my neighbor.He was a great talker, I remembered;it used to take hours to get away from him once he began talking.I was not at all sorry when he went to live in another part of London.We had not met since then,nor did I wish to meet him now, when my holiday was about to begin.
    Luckily at that moment he was much too busy talking to the man opposite him to have the chance to notice me.I slipped back into my compartment,took down my two suitcases and carried them to the far end of the corridor so as to be ready to get off the train as soon as it stopped.The moment the train came to a stop,I called a porter, who  _ carried my luggage out of the station and found a taxi for me.As I drove towards the small hotel on the other end of the town,I breathed a deep relief and felt happy that there was little chance that I should run into my boring ex-neighbor again.
    When I reached the hotel, I went straight to my room and rested there until it was time for dinner.Then I went to the lounge  and ordered a drink.I had hardly raised the glass to my lips when a too familiar voice greeted me.I had not escaped from my tiresome neighbor after all !",high21508.txt
