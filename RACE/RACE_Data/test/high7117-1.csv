1,B,"['Kaitlyn Rentala', 'Robbie Pokora', 'Michael Massett', 'Kate Macrae']",Who supports the idea of paying student athletes?,"""Show them the money!"" That's what some people are saying for college athletes. They say students who play sports for their school should receive salaries.
Top athletes should be paid because many of them practice full time, Mark Jameson argues. Rico Cannon, a former college football player, agrees. ""Nonathletes can get a job for extra spending money, but many student athletes spend so many hours in training that they don't have time to work,"" he explains. ""Shouldn't athletes be able to earn extra money too?""
The students also make money for their schools when people buy tickets to their games. The players should receive some of that cash, supporter Robbie Pokora reasons.
College athletes are about honor and tradition, but they're also a business. Thanks to ticket sales, there's money for schools to build new athletic stadiums and give the coaches high salaries. The cash should be shared with athletes. They're the ones out on the field or court working hard for their school.
The money matter has others _ , though. Kaitlyn Rentala argues that colleges should not pay their athletes. Students are in school to get an education. Playing a sport is an extracurricular activity, not a job. If athletes need extra money, they can apply for college scholarships . Michael Massett is a middle school teacher and a football and a basketball coach. He agrees. ""Athletes should be paid with scholarships, like nonathletes are,"" Massett explains.
In addition, if colleges pay their athletes, those students might focus more on sports than on their education. ""Most students do not become professional athletes after college. If they focus too much on sports, they may not learn the skills they need to get good jobs,"" Kate Macrae reasons. Plus, she says, many athletes have schoolships that help them pay for school.",high7117.txt
