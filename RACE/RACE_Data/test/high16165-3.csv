3,C,"['the old should led a simple life', 'the old should face the fact of aging', 'the old should take more exercise', 'the old should fill themselves with curiosity']",We can infer from the passage that,"I recently turned fifty, which is young for a tree, midlife for an elephant, and ancient for a sportsman. Fifty is a nice number for the states in the US or for a national speed limit but it is not a number that I was prepared to have hung on me.

I find myself moving toward what is ahead with a curious blend   of both fighting and accepting my aging, hoping that the philosopher   was right when he said."" Old is always fifteen years from now.""",high16165.txt
