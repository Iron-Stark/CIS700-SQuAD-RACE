2,B,"['To children, anxiety is completely avoidable.', 'TV and computer play an important role in isolating children from the real world.', ""Exercise does not help to lessen children's anxiety."", 'Sometimes local news about crime and murder also affects children a little.']",Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?,"I'm usually fairly skeptical about any research that concludes that people are either happier or unhappier or more or less certain of themselves than they were 50 years ago. While any of these statements might be true, they are practically impossible to prove scientifically. Still, I was struck by a report which concluded that today's children are significantly more anxious than children in the 1950s. In fact, the analysis showed, normal children aged 9 to 17 exhibit a higher level of anxiety today than children who were treated for mental illness 50 years ago.
Why are America's kids so stressed? The report cites two main causes: increasing physical isolation  brought on by high divorce rates and less involvement in community, among other things and a growing perception that the world is a more dangerous place.
Considering that we can't turn the clock back, adults can still do plenty to help the next generation.
At the top of the list is nurturing  a better appreciation of the limits of individualism. No child is an island. Strengthening social ties helps build communities and protect individuals against stress.
To help kids build stronger connections with others, you can pull the plug on TVs and computers. Your family will thank you later. They will have more time for facetoface relationships, and they will get more sleep.
Limit the amount of virtual  violence your children are exposed to. It's not just video games and movies; children see a lot of murder and crime on the local news.
Keep your expectations for your children reasonable. Many highly successful people never attended Harvard or Yale.
Make exercise part of your daily routine. It will help you cope with your own anxieties and provide a good model for your kids. Sometimes anxiety is unavoidable. But it doesn't have to ruin your life.",high14089.txt
