4,B,"['Fifth Customers', ""There's no Easy Answer"", 'No Time to Finish Homework', 'A Cold Morning for Jane']",The best title for this reading should be   _,"It was just three degrees above zero. ""That's cold,"" thought Jane as she got ready to deliver her morning papers. Jane has 50 customers, and on cold mornings when she couldn't ride her bike, it took her more than an hour to make her rounds.
As she collected her papers and put them into a big canvas bag, Jane regretted that she hadn't finished her math homework the night before. There was still time. She'd hurry with the papers and finish the math before breakfast.
Less than an hour later, Jane was nearly finished. She had only five customers to go. She could then head for home to complete her math while her mom fixed breakfast. As she rounded the corner, she saw a car in the middle of the street. It was Mr. Zimmerman, the elderly man who walked with a walking stick. His car was out of gas.
""I'd like to help Mr. Zimmerman,"" thought Jane. ""but if I do, I won't have time to do my homework."" She hated to think what Mr. Roberts would say if she hadn't completed her papers.
""It's his own fault for running out of gas,"" Jane talked to herself, ""the station is only a half mile down the street. Surely Mr. Zimmerman can walk that far, even on a cold morning like this... can't he?"" As she walked down the street, Jane wondered what to do.",high9483.txt
