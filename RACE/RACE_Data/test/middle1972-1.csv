He had a very big orange tree in his garden. On the tree there were many fine oranges.
One day the old man found one of the oranges was bigger than the others. It was as big as a watermelon. So he took the big orange to the king. The king was very happy and gave the old man a lot of money for it.
When a rich man heard of this, he said to himself, ""It is only an orange. Why did the king give him so much money? If I take my gold cup to the king, he will give me much more money for it.""
The next day when the king got the gold cup, he said to the rich man, ""What a beautiful cup! I'll give you something for it. Please take the great orange.""",middle1972.txt
