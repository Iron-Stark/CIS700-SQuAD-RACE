2,B,"['might have returned the bag of cookies secretly.', 'tried to share his cookies with the woman.', ""was thankful for the woman's kindness."", 'was really a thief.']",We can infer that the man  _  .,"A woman was waiting at an airport one night, with several long hours before her flight. She bought a book and a bag of cookies in the airport shop, and found a place to drop.
She was interested in her book, but the man sitting beside her grabbed a cookie or two from the bag in between, which she tried to ignore to avoid an argument.
So she ate the cookies noisily and watched the clock, as the cookie thief diminished (......) her stock. She was getting angrier as the minutes passed, thinking,""Oh, brother, if I wasn't so nice, I would blacken your eyes.""
With each cookie she took, he took one, too. When only one was left, she wondered what he would do. With a smile on his face, he took the last cookie and broke it in half. He offered her half, and he ate the other. She got it from him and thought, "" This guy has some nerve   and he's also rude. Why didn't he even show any gratitude?""
She had never known when she had been so angry. She gathered her bag and headed for the gate, refusing to look back at the thieving ingrate  .
She boarded the plane and then she sought her book, which was almost complete. As she reached in her bag, she was shocked-- there was her bag of cookies. ""If mine are here,"" she thought, ""the others were his. It's too late to apologize.""",high5080.txt
