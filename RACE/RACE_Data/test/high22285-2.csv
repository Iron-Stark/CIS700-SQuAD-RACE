He was getting bounced around in the roughest white water he had ever seen. There was nothing the river threw at him.
   There he was in a 40-pound boat, with only a few months of training and one arm. Tied to his left shoulder was a prosthetic limb that he'd had for just about a week. The plan was to paddle  for 20 days over 227 miles of the roughest white water in the United States. It was one of the most remarkable adventures that the Grand Canyon had ever seen.
  It started with a casual phone call in the spring of 2005. A good friend, Mike Crenshaw, finally got a permit from the National Park Service to lead a private party of 16 boaters down the Colorado River that coming August. He had a slot  open for Willie, ""Was he interested ?""
  ""It was the chance of a lifetime,"" Stewart said. He had been waiting years for this trip to happen. ""How could I refuse ?""
   But before they set off, Stewart had a couple of things to take care of. He had to get a white-water kayak, learn how to use it, and get an arm.
