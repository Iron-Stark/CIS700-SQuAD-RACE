2,C,"[""She is now living abroad but doesn't enjoy the life there."", ""She sometimes doubts her father's philosophy."", 'She shows a positive attitude to her relationship with others.', 'She doesn\'t think highly of her friends by saying ""They are good"".']",Which of the following statements about the writer is not TRUE?,"My father always told me never to ever reveal my true opinions towards other people unless such opinions are positive. He said this is the ""Chu Shi Zhe Xue"", the philosophy of dealing with social network.
  It seems that everybody here just follows this philosophy very, very well.
 I would say that if I were given true friendship I would definitely treasure it with my greatest care. If I really regard someone as my close friend, I would never leave her alone whenever she's in need, either financially or mentally. And I always believe, as long as I treat people with whole-hearted honesty, I would have some rewards--at least, just ONE true friend of the same gender.
 Sometimes I just miss my friends in China. Perhaps when we became friends, we were still young, too young to have been polluted by any dirt in the society. But here, it is simply different. It seems that all of us have learned how to survive in a foreign land and such an experience actually makes us learn how to get the most benefits from the surroundings in order to survive.
 All are friends around me. I've looked through all the dark sides of their personalities and yet I have to pretend that I know nothing. I say to myself:They are good and we are friends"". And then I can make myself comfortable enough to talk to people I hate the most. And of course, they don't say any words truly from their hearts. Neither do I. 
However, sometimes I just feel unwilling to talk to these people. Sometimes, I just want to be alone, quietly, without being forced to listen to their gossip or other useless words.
""Standing on a mountain high
Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky
I should go and see some friends          
But they don't really comprehend""
    The singer expresses my feelings, too.",high17355.txt
