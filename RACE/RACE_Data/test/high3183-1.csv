It wasn't easy for Zoe's hard-working single mother to make ends meet. They moved in and out of homeless shelters.
Everything changed for Zoe in grade nine. At that time, she heard about a sewing  class at her school. She signed up and couldn't wait to turn her designs into clothes. The color of the first dress she made was white-black strips. Soon the clothes she wore were all made by her. Other girls at school loved her designs too. They asked her if they could buy dresses from her. Zoe sold her first dress for $13. Unfortunately, it cost her $25 to make the dress. ""I had the creativity in designs,"" says Zoe. ""But I really had no idea about business.""

Supermodel Tyra Banks heard about it and she invited Zoe to take part in her TV show. ""Being recognized I felt really unreal,""says Zoe.
