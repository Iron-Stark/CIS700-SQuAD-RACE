These two kinds of sports are team sports and individual   sports. Team sports are such sports as baseball, basketball, and volleyball. Team sports need two separate   teams. The teams play against each other. They compete against each other to get the best score. For example, in a football game, if team A gets 8 points and team B gets 4 points, team A wins the game. Team sports are sometimes called competitive   sports.
