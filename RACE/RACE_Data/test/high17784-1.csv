A polar vortex is a cold, thick low pressure system. The air turns counter-clockwise when on the move.
The polar vortex started up in Canada. After crossing the border, it moved deep into the southeastern United States. The polar vortex brought the coldest temperatures in more than 20 years to many areas. Alice Jenkins lives in Washington D.C.

close.
But the polar vortex did not have the same effect everywhere.
Interestingly enough, it is warmer in Alaska and also somewhat warmer over Greenland because when you exhaust cold air in the North Pole and the Arctic region, when it's forced southward, it can't all stay there. Basically it's rushing towards us in the United States.""

Temperatures of minus 10 degrees Celsius or lower were reported in Washington, New York, Boston and Philadelphia. In fact, temperatures in all or parts of the 50 states were below freezing at some point on Tuesday. Even in Hawaii, it was minus six degrees at the top of the state's highest mountain. 
The effect of the polar vortex was extensive. Airline companies cancelled more than 11,000 flights over a four day period. The cold weather also interfered with train service.
