0,C,"['to show the generosity of the city government', 'to form a bigger education company', 'to leave room for a new project', 'to build a new museum for education']",The purpose of the school relocation is   _  .,"NEW ORLEANS --A two-story, 1,500-ton and 16,000-square foot school built in 1879 is being moved about 300 yards to make way for the new University Medical Center in MidCity.
The school' s relocation is marked as the largest structure ever to be moved in Louisiana and one of the top-ten heaviest in America.Officials originally had planned to  _ the McDonogh No.11 School, but agreed to move the historic building at the city's request.
The school is being moved on a platform of steel beams put under the schoolhouse floor, then set on 38 remote-controlled power dollies made mobile by 300 tires.The school is creeping forward on a short stay that will take about two days to move it about 300 yards.
State officials said the operation shows how closely the state and city leaders are working topreserve history.
"" We' re looking to the future and building for the future, and building something new.We're also honoring the past and trying to save something historic,"" said Michael Diresto with the Division of Administration for the state of Louisiana.
Christian Cancienne, president and CEO of Orleans Shoring, said the feat of this endeavor is something a person rarely sees.
""When we heard about the opportunity to move a building this size, we knew that there was never a building moved this size in the state of Louisiana,"" he said.""We knew that because of the oak trees and neutral ground and the narrow streets, we may never get the opportunity in our hometown again to do something like this.
Cancienne said the cost of the huge project weighs in at $350,000, but he' s not making any profit from the move.Cancienne said his team wanted to do the project for free because of the once in a lifetime opportunity.""When my guys heard that this opportunity was here, they said, 'Let' s do it for free.We got to get it.No one else can do it.' And, so, we said let's just cover our cost so we bid it at $ 350,000.""
Cancienne' s company is used to moving homes across the city, but is happy to partake in the monumental task of moving a historic landmark.The building won' t remain at its current destination on Banks Street, though.It will eventually move to its permanent location once that has been determined.",high21884.txt
