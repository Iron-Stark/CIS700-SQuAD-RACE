But from Monday to Friday, they must go to school. So on Saturday and Sunday they stay at home and watch TV from morning to night. They don't know it's bad for their eyes. Usually children like to eat fish, meat and chicken and don't like vegetables or fruit. They don't know eating more vegetables or fruit. They don't know eating more vegetables and fruit is better than eating meat.
