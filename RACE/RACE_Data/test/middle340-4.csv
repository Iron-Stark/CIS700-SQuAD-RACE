4,B,"['He made a mistake carelessly in the bill', 'He tried to get more money for his work.', 'He had written the bill before the writer got home', ""He had talked about the bill with the writer's wife.""]",What can we learn about John from the passage?,"0ur village carpenter ,John Hill, came one day and made a dining table for my wife.  He made it just the right size to fill the space between the two window.  When I got home that evening, John was drinking a cup of tea and writing out his bill( ) for his job.
My wife said to me quietly, ""That's his ninth cup of tea today. ""But she said in a loud voice, ""It's a beautiful table, dear, isn't it?"" ""I'll decide about that when I see the bill,"" I said.  John laughed and gave me his bill for the work.  I read:
One dining table                 10thNovember, 2011
Cost of wood                    $ 17:00
Paint                           $1. 50
Work, 8 hours($1 an hour)          $8. 00
Total                           $36. 50
When I was looking at the bill, John said,"" It's been a fine day, hasn't it? Quite sunny. ""
""Yes,"" I said.  ""I'm glad it's only the 10thof November. ""
""Me, too,"" said John, ""you wait--it will be a lot colder by the end of the month. ""
""Yes, colder--and more expensive! Dining table will be $20 more expensive on November 30th, won't they, John?""
John looked hard at me for half a minute.  Was there a little smile in his two blue eyes? I gave his bill back to him.
""If it's not too much trouble, John,"" I said,""Please add  it up again, You can forget the date-------""
I paid him $26. 50 and he was happy to get it.",middle340.txt
