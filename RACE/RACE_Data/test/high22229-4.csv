4,B,"['The water body of the earth will be dead by the year 2010 without any effective measure.', 'All the Oceans in the world are polluted by oil.', ""It's possible that all the creatures in the sea will die out if no action is taken."", 'Some kinds of the living things in waters have been poisoned and we must be careful of them.']",Which of the following statements is WRONG according to the passage?,"All the oceans of the world will be dead in the future unless action is taken at once. How can this happen?
We have already seen that people allow all sorts of waste products to flow into the sea. It is almost impossible to measure how much waste water and industrial waste in our oceans, but we can find out how much oil is poured into them legally and illegally. It is illegal to pour oil into the sea close to the shore, but when a ship is many miles out to sea, there are no such rules. Scientists have different ideas as to the amount of oil putting into the sea, but the lowest figure for oil poured in European waters alone is nearly 200 000 tons every year. Some people say the figure could be ten times as high.
It is not only our coasts that suffer from oil pollution. Many shell fish, for example, now have high amounts of poisonous substances . Next time you have shell fish to eat, how can you be sure that they are free from oil pollution? You cannot see the effects and you cannot taste them, either. It is really quite a problem.",high22229.txt
