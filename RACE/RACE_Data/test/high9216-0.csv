You are not alone. Holidays are times for celebrating. Many people are worried about their weight. With proper planning, though, it is possible to keep normal weight during the holidays. The idea is to enjoy the holidays but not to eat too much. You don't have to turn away from the foods that you enjoy.
Here are some tips for preventing weight gain and maintaining physical fitness:
Don't skip meals. Before you leave home, have a small, low-fat meal or snack . This may help to avoid getting too excited before delicious foods.
Control the amount of food. Use a small plate that may encourage you to ""load up  "". You should be most comfortable eating an amount of food about the size of your fist  .
Begin with soup and fruit or vegetables. Fill up beforehand on water-based soup and raw fruit or vegetables, or drink a large glass of water before you eat to help you to feel full.
Avoid high-fat foods. Dishes that look oily or creamy may have large amount of fat. Choose lean meat . Fill your plate with salad and green vegetables. Use lemon juice instead of creamy food.
Stick to physical activity. Don't let exercise take a break during the holidays. A 20-minute walk helps to burn off extra calories.(238 words)",high9216.txt
