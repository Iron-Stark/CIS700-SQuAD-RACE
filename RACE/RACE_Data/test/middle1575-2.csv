please don't let it sleep.You should make better use of it .It can tell you not only the meaning of the words but also the use of them.What's more, it can tell you how to use them.
It is true that dictionaries are very useful and important to us.They are like silent teachers. When you have a question, you can turn to them.They will give you the right answer.They are also like a trusted friend and stay with you forever. You can learn a lot from them .
