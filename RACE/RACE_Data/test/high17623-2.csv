2,D,"['Because he observed things with the eye and the mind.', 'Because he looked young when he was old.', 'Because he never stopped painting he was old.', 'Because he never gave up looking for something new.']","Why have people called Picasso ""the youngest painter in the world?""","Most painters discover a style of painting that is fit for them and stick to that, especially if people admire their pictures. But Picasso, the great Spanish painter, was like a man who had not yet found his own particular style of painting. He kept on struggling to find the perfect expression till his death in 1973.
Some of Picasso's painting are rich, soft color1ed and beautiful. Others are ugly and cruel and strange. But such paintings allow us to imagine things for ourselves. They force us to say to ourselves,""What does he see that makes him paint like that?"" And we begin to look under the surface of the things we see..
Picasso painted thousands of pictures in different styles. Sometimes he painted the natural look of things. Sometimes he seemed to break them apart and throw the pieces in our faces. He showed us what the mind knows as well as what the eyes see. At the age of 90,he remained as curious about the world as he had been when he was young. That is why people have called him ""the youngest painter in the world.""",high17623.txt
