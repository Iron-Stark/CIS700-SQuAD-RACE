1,C,"['supermarkets will stop selling alcohol in low prices', '""women drink free"" nights will not be closed', 'over-drinking will still not be stopped', 'under-age people will not continue drinking']","Some people believe when the tough new rules come into effect,   _  .","New rules for pubs and clubs, including a ban   on drinking games like the awful ""dentist's chair"", will be introduced in Britain this year to prevent the heavy drinking culture, which costs the country billions of pounds a year.
Other activities like ""all you can drink for 10 pounds "", ""women drink free"" nights and speed drinking competitions will also be banned.
But, on the other hand, offers of cheap alcohol in supermarkets will not be affected, which is widely regarded as one of the main sources of Britain's problems with under-age and over-drinking.
Doctors and health experts argue that the government has failed to use its most effective weapon, the taxation  of minimum price controls on alcohol.
Home Secretary Alan Johnson said that the government and the industry had a duty to act on heavy drinking."" These bans have a real impact on society, not to mention the lives of those who just want to enjoy a good night out,"" he said.
""The dentist's chair"", where drinks are poured directly into the mouth by others, was made famous by the celebrations of footballer Paul Gascoigne at Euro '96. That game and others that promote large consumption will be banned from April and publicans   will have to ensure free tap water is made available to the drinkers.
The government says over-drinking costs Britain up to 12 billion pounds a year and has announced that any pubs that go against the new mandatory code   will face severe punishment. For instance, publicans and vendors   could lose their licenses, be fined up to 20,000 pounds ($32,750) or face six months in prison.",high3422.txt
