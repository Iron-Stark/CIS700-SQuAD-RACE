1,D,"[""We'd better pay for ourselves."", 'We should learn their language well.', ""We'd better pay for others after meal."", 'We have to learn both their language and culture.']",". From the passage we know, when we visit a foreign country,  _  .","Before I left to meet Lynne, my friend told me that I had better take some money, but I didn't listen to him. I thought that Lynne would pay because she invited me.
I arrived at the restaurant on time because I knew Americans like to be on time. Lynne and I sat at a table near the door and soon we began to enjoy ourselves there.
The food there was very delicious. I talked a lot about Saudi Arabia and Lynne told me all about herself. After two hours the waiter came and asked if we wanted one check  or two. Lynne said two. Lynne paid her check, and the waiter gave me mine, I had no money. Then I had an idea, I called my friend. In a few minutes he arrived with some money. He laughed at me all the way home.
Now, I think it's funny, but I guess you can understand how I felt at that time. So when you visit a foreign country, you have to learn their language and culture.",middle1019.txt
