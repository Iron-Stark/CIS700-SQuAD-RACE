In Washington DC, US, local   zoo-goers are sad about the news that their superstar panda Tai Shan is going to leave the National Zoo.
At a morning meeting on December 4, zoo director  Steven Montfort said that the black-eared bear would be going off to China sometime over the winter, under an agreement with the Chinese government.
