1,A,"['easily won a major golf tournament.', 'nearly won a major golf tournament.', 'joined the Augusta Golf Club.', 'won a completely new golf tournament.']",Less than a year after turning professional.Tiger Woods,"Golf in the USA was until quite recently the hobby of old,middle class white men.Not any more.The fact that the class,age and race barriers that existed in the sport have finally been  broken down is due almost entirely to two people.Tiger Woods and Michelle Wie.
Tiger Woods was born in California in 1975 and is one of the greatest golfers of all time.His ethnic background is marvelously rich and varied.His father Earl was of mixed of black,Chinese and Native American ancestry and his mother Kultida,who was originally from Thailand,also had Chinese and Dutch forefathers.
Woods became a professional golfer in 1996 and,less than a year later,astonished the world easily winning the prestigious Masters Colf Tournament,an annual event which takes place at the Augusta Golf Club in Georgia,USA.At 21,he was the youngest golfer ever to win the tournament,but much more important,he was also the first Asian American to do it.
Woods'amazing achievement is put into perspective when you realize that until 1990,no non-white American had ever been allowed to join Augusta Golf Club.Even in 2000,it only had two black members.In fact,in 1977,Clifford Roberts,the chairman of the club and founder of the Masters Tournament,proclaimed:""As long as 1 am alive,golfers will be white and caddies
 will be black.""Roberts died not long after making this racist remark...
Fortunately,his views were not shared by his successors and the dramatic appearance of Tiger Woods on the Golf scene radically changed attitudes to the sport and prompted a major surge of interest in the game among ethnic minorities end young people in the USA.
Michelle Wie,a Korean American born in 1989 whose mother was an amateur golf champion in Korea,will probably became the greatest woman golfer of all time.She's 1.85 meters tall and she can play a golf ball further than most men.Like Woods,she has transformed the world of golf,and wants to do so in even more dramatic ways.She has expressed her determination to play on the men's tournament circuit,not just the women's,and has already appeared in several professional men's tournaments.
Thanks to Woods and Wie,golf in America will never be the same again.",high17462.txt
