0,B,"[""People in Britain seldom have balconies because it's so hot outside."", '""Home"" is a place where you feel safe and relaxed.', 'Although homes look different in different countries, they have the same needs.', 'Houses in northern Europe always have big windows and cool stone floors.']",Which one is true according to the passage?,"What does the word ""home"" mean to you? How do you say the word in French? In Spanish? In your language? Although people usually know what the word means, it often has no exact translation. It's not surprising really, because the idea of home differs from country to country, and from person to person. A home is more than a roof and four walls. It's the cooking, eating, talking, playing and family living that go on inside, which are important as well. And at home you usually feel safe and relaxed.
But it's not just that homes look different in different countries, they also contain different things and reveal  different attitudes and needs. For example, in cold northern Europe, there's a fire in the living room or kitchen and all the chairs face it. In the south, where the sun shines a lot and it's more important to keep the heat out, there are small windows, cool stone floors and often no carpets. We asked some people about their homes.
