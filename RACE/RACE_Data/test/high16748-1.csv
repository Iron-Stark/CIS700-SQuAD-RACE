1,B,"[""It's meant for excellent students."", ""It's well beyond what the author could be responsible for."", 'Students must pay it off as soon as they get a job.', 'Students can receive the money monthly.']",Which of the following statements about the loan is right?,"The day the letter arrived from my university telling me how much I owed them for my first semester, I felt a lump forming in my throat. I hadn't even started my degree and already I was in debt. But although the sum was unsettling, I had peace of mind: I had taken out a loan that would cover the next three years of tuition fees and living expenses.
A government body in the UK, the Student Loans Company, provides loans to students whose parents cannot afford to cover the costs themselves. Students forward this amount to the university in advance and agree to repay the loan when they begin their first job. For me, it was a lot of money -around &6,000(60,860 Yuan) per year in total -and much more than I had ever been responsible for. I would receive a couple of thousand pounds per semester -half for tuition fees, half for living costs. 
Even though I will be paying off my debt for a long time, I don't regret my decision. 
Having a loan taught me a lot about money management, which I would not have learned otherwise. Each term I paid my tuition fees in one payment, but I also received my loan for living costs in one payment. It was up to me to organize how I would spend this. 
I divided the amount to calculate my weekly budget and it was important that I tried not to overspend. I had to be disciplined and keep a close eye on my expenditure. Food, clothes and going out are the main things students spend money on. 
With a loan, students have total financial freedom. Instead of having someone looking over their shoulder, they must make every financial decision for themselves. 
This year, university fees were tripled. But when it comes to money management, perhaps this generation will be the smartest yet.",high16748.txt
