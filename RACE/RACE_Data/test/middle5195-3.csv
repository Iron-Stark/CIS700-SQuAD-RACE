I am Jack. I want to be in a club in our school. I can't sing or dance or act in movies, but I can do many other things. I can play three _ , the guitar, the violin   and the piano. I think I can be in the music club. Maybe   I can be a famous musician. I like reading story books and I can write stories. Maybe I can be a famous writer. I like sports too, but I don't think I can be a famous and successful sportsman  . Can I join you?
Yours,
Jack",middle5195.txt
