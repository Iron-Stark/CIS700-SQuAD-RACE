The tiger slipped through a passage between the enclosure and a neighboring storage building,where it fatally attacked the 43yearold keeper,said police spokesman Stefan Kirchner.
""It appears the gate wasn't properly shut,"" Kirchner told the Associated Press.
The zoo was evacuated and a SWAT  team was called in,police said.But before it arrived the zoo's director managed to kill the tiger by climbing onto the storage building and shooting it through a skylight using a rifle.
Kirchner said it was unlikely that members of the public had witnessed the incident.""This is the darkest day of my life,"" the zoo's director,Theo Pagel,was quoted as saying by Cologne newspaper Express.
The paper said on its website that the Siberian tiger was a 4yearold male called Tltai that came to Cologne Zoo from an animal park in England.In November it fathered three cubs with a 7yearold Siberian tiger called Hanya,according to the zoo's website.
Police said the zoo reopened after Saturday's incident,which occurred around noon.However,a planned latenight opening of the zoo has been canceled.
