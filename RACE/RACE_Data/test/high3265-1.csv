The flying car has been talked about for many years,but now it appears that the idea is about to become a reality.
An international company has built a two-seater plane that, at the touch of a button ,transforms into a car perfectly suitable for driving on public roads. It has been designed so that the wings fold up automatically; and it takes just 15 seconds to switch between flying and driving. With its wings fully open and the propeller spinning, it can take off from any airfield.
Flying cars are quicker than traditional ones for travelling from city to city,and they can run on ordinary fuel. Another big advantage is that they are cool ,like something you would see in an action film. At the moment9however, the flying car's wheels are illegal to leave the ground. That is not because of technical reasons or problems with the design. It is because the various road and aircraft authorities simply cannot agree on whether it is a car or a plane.
""The government and the authorities have never thought seriously about a flying car, says Alan Price ,the president of the company that has developed it. ""I wanted a car that could fly and drive ,but it is difficult to find an organization prepared to insure the vehicle against accidents.
Nevertheless?the company hopes to produce and deliver its first flying car soon. The company already has orders for 40 of them. The majority the potential customers are older and some are retired. There have even been orders from some people who have no pilot's license.
The flying car will cost around $ 200.000. ""For an airplane,that's a very reasonable price, but for a car, It's quite expensive,"" explains Alan. ""But it just is not possible to make a $ 10,000 flying car yet. ""
This latest means of transport will not become a mass-market item in the near future,but in the long term it has the potential to change the way you travel. It will become no more expensive than driving your car on the motorway. Travel time could be reduced by more than half.
So the next time you are told to fasten your seat belt, it may be to prepare for take-off.",high3265.txt
