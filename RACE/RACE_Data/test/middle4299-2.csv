A tall tale is a story about a person who is larger than life. The descriptions in the story are exaggerated  , which makes the story funny. People who had lived in undeveloped areas in America first told tall tales. After a hard day's work, they would get together to tell each other funny stories. One character from these stories was Paul Bunyan, a hero who cut down trees in North America. Tradition says he cleared forests from the northeastern United States to the Pacific Ocean.
It is said that Paul Bunyan was born in the northeastern American state of Maine. His mother and father were shocked when they first saw the boy. When the boy was only a few weeks old, he weighed more than forty-five kilograms. As a child, Paul was always hungry. His parents needed ten cows to supply  milk for his meals. Before long, he ate fifty eggs and ten containers of potatoes every day. Young Paul grew so big that his parents did not know what to do with him. Once, Paul rolled over  so much in his sleep that he caused an earthquake. This angered people in the town where his parents lived.
