0,B,"['helping keep the particles out with more masks', 'pulling particles to the ground with an electromagnetic field', 'absorbing hair with a balloon with static', 'creating clean air and letting it out into the sky']",The device works by  _  .,"Roosegaarde, an artist and designer from Dutch has thought of a device . He hopes it will make Beijing's sky clear again and help the people with masks breathe fresh air again in Beijing.
An electromagnetic field  will pull the dirty particles in the air to the ground, and then they can be easily cleaned.
Roosegaarde says, ""It's like when you have a balloon which has static electricity  and your hair goes toward it. Smog happens the same way as the hair.""
His workplace has reached an agreement with the Beijing government to test the technology in one of the capital's parks.  Beijing's skies are regularly covered by grey smog. Serious cases of air pollution are often reported in Beijing. Roosegaarde says an indoor test has already shown it works well and he is confident of the results. With the help of a team of scientists and engineers, he is sure that the device can be worked outside.
""Beijing is a very good place to test the device because the smog in Beijing is quite low and there's not so much wind."" says Roosegaarde. ""We'll be able to make the air pure but the most difficult thing is to remove the smog. As a result, you can see the sun again.""
Roosegaarde also reminds us that his aim is not only to give a plan to solve Beijing's dirty air pollution but also to make people pay attention to the environment problem. He adds, ""This is not the real answer for smog. The real answer to do with it is clean cars, different industry and different lifestyles. "" However, he hopes the project will make the citizens realize the differences between clean air and smog-filled air.",middle2896.txt
