Well, imagine how my sister felt when she went off for the first time to New York for a business trip. After a few days she was still amazed at how friendly everyone was to her until she took a taxi back to her hotel one night. First she gave just the name of the hotel, but when asked she said the address too. Then she was asked how to get there, but of course she didn't know. Imagine how frightened she was when the driver started shouting at her for not knowing the way.
The UK
A friend was in London for a conference. He took a taxi and there were no problems: the driver knew the way and was very cheerful. The problem started when he realized he had stupidly left his laptop on the back seat! He called the company up and, in a panic, went straightaway to their Lost and Found office. He was _ to find the laptop waiting for him, and then very surprised that it was one of 2,900 left in taxis over the past six months!
Tunisia
Well, my brother took a Mediterranean cruise  one summer and had a day in Tunis. He spent most of the afternoon in the Medina buying presents when he suddenly realized he'd completely lost track of time and there was only half an hour before the ship left the port. There had been loads of yellow taxis in the centre so he wasn't too bothered until he stood on the pavement and waited for one to appear----and of course there wasn't a single one in sight! Nothing! He questioned a passer-by who explained that the cost for the taxi ride goes up in the evening so the taxi drivers disappear until they can charge higher prices! Luckily for my brother the man then offered to give him a lift and he caught the boat on time!",high14260.txt
