1,D,"['why people like to look at clothes and shoes', 'why Chinese consume so many luxury brands', 'why young people build their self-image through clothes', 'why people spend so much money on designer labels']",The author finds it hard to understand   _  .,"In the market of luxury   brands, Chinese consumers are only second to the Japanese in the world.
Across the globe it's clear that the young generation are increasingly relying on expensive brands for their self-image.
Personally I am a fashion-lover, at least in spirit. I love to look at clothes and shoes. But I don't understand why people spend large amounts of money on designer labels. Certainly, young people, whether in China or elsewhere, should be building their self-confidence in other ways. When a young woman shows off a handbag worth two months' salary, that's a scary thing.
What are the psychological factors forcing young people to take on debt for designer items?
The desire to say, ""Hey, look at me. I'm wealthy. I have social status.""
Scientists have found the acquisition of luxury brands doesn't lead to happiness. Study after study has shown that, although we are born to desire material possessions, when we get them, we don't suddenly become ""happy people"".
In fact, a series of studies by Leaf Van Boven at the University of Colorado, US, have shown that individuals who invest   in travel and other experiences get more pleasure than those who invest in material things. That's because experiences are more easily combined into a person's identity. If I travel to Yunnan, that adventure affects how I think. My memories entertain my friends and colleagues. It follows, then, that investing in experiences improves my chances for successful social relationships.
Moreover, as Van Boven has observed, young people who pursue happiness through ""things"" are liked less by others than young people who seek happiness through experiences. 
This research is pretty solid, but I suspect it won't persuade young people not to desire a style. It's natural to want to express yourself through your appearance. So my advice is, create a look that isn't tied to a designer label. 
You don't have to  _ to send a message about who you are. Take a trip. Go out into the world. Then come back and confidently create your own signature look.",high20965.txt
