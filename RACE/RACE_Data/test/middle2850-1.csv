1,D,"['Point 3.', 'Point 4.', 'Point 5.', 'Point 6.']",Which point is about how to end a friendship?,"Having friends, and finding new friendships is an important developmental task for preteens and teens. While they have learned to play well with others during their childhood, developing independent friendships is a different thing.
