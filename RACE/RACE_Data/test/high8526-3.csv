This version of Glass, though, still isn't the perfect product that Google hopes to sell in stores later this year.
For now, Google is still trying to recruit  more people willing to serve as volunteers for its attempt to build a wearable device that features some of the same feature as a smart phone. "" Our Explorers are moms, bakers, surgeons, rockers, and each new Explorer has brought a new view that is making Glass better,"" Google said.
The device has a small screen attached above the right eye. A user can check e-mails, see Twitter post or get directions without having to use a phone. It can also take hands-free photos and video through voice-activated  commands. The ability to record images so easily has raised safely concerns about drivers wearing Glass. The lawmakers have to draw up new rules forbidding use of the device in moving vehicles.
