3,C,"['What Do Three Shots And Two Shots Mean In A Forest', 'How To Find Your Friends When You Are Lost In The Woods', 'What To Do If You Get Lost In A Forest', 'The Most Important Thing To Do Is To Stay In One Place']",What's the best title for the passage?,"If you go into the woods with your friends, stay with them. If you don't, you may get lost. If you do get lost, this is what you should do.
Sit down and stay where you are. Don't try to find your friends -- let them find you. You can help them to find you by staying in one place.
There is another way to help your friends or other people nearby to find you. Give them a signal by shouting or whistling three times. Stop. Then shout or whistle three times again. Any signal given three times is a call for help. You will be helped by others.
Keep up the shouting or whistling, always three times together. When people hear you, they will know that you are not just making noise for fun. They will let you know they have heard your signal. They will give two shouts, two whistles or two gunshots. When a signal is given twice, it is an answer to a call for help.
If you don't think that you will get help before night comes, try to make a little house and cover up the holes with branches with lots of leaves and grass. What should you do if you get hungry or need to drink some water? You should have to leave your little branch house to look for a brook. Don't just walk away. Pick off small branches and drop them as you walk so that you can find your way back.
The most important thing to do when you are lost is -- stay in one place.",high10525.txt
