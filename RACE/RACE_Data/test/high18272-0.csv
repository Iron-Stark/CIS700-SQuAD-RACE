0,A,"['It paid close attention to the effect of fathers on their children.', '912 children and adults took part in the study.', 'It lasted as long as several months.', 'It was funded by the California State University.']",What do we know about the study from the passage?,"Sons who have fond childhood memories of their fathers are more likely to be emotionally stable in the face of day-to-day stresses, according to psychologists who studied hundreds of adults of all ages. ""As our study shows, fathers do play a unique and important role in the mental health of their children much later in life,"" psychology professor Melanie Mallers of California State University said.
              For this study, 912 adult men and women between the ages of 25 and 74 completed short daily telephone interviews about that day's experiences over an eight-day period. The interviews focused on the participants' psychological and emotional distress   (i.e.whether they were nervous, sad, etc.) and if they had experienced any stressful events that day.
              The participants were also required to answer questions such as, ""How would you rate your relationship with your mother during the years when you were growing up?"" and ""How much time and attention did your mother give you when you needed it?"" The same questions were asked about fathers.
              People who reported they had a good mother-child relationship reported three percent less psychological distress compared to those who reported a poor relationship, according to Mallers. Men who reported having a good relationship with their fathers during childhood were more likely to be less emotional when reacting to stressful events in their current daily lives than those who had a poor relationship, according to her findings.
              Also, the quality of mother and father relationships was significantly associated with how many stressful events the participants faced on a daily basis. In other words, if they had a poor childhood relationship with both parents, they reported more stressful incidents over the eight-day study when compared to those who had a good relationship with their parents.
              Mallers explained why healthy or unhealthy relationships may have an effect on how people handle stress as adults. ""Perhaps having caring parents equips children with the experiences and skills necessary to more successfully navigate their relationships with other people throughout childhood and into adulthood,"" she said.",high18272.txt
