Thank you for your e-mail and the photo of New York. Here are some photos of my family trip in Wuhan. In the first photo, my sister Jane is wearing Chinese traditional clothes on the Yellow Grower. In the second picture, my father and I are swimming in a river. It's so cool! In the next picture, my parents, Jane and I are eating great noodles. Its name is hot dry noodles. It looks very nice!
In the last picture, my family people are at my friend's home. We are having some mooncakes because it's the Mid-autumn Festival. It's an important festival in China. On this day, all the families get together and have a happy dinner.
I think Wuhan is a nice city in China. The people there are friendly. One day I wish to go there again.
Yours,
David
