0,D,"['Because she got into trouble with her friend.', ""Because she couldn't enjoy her meal quietly."", 'Because her friend complained so much.', 'Because she was doing poorly in her study.']",Why did the author say she was in misery?,"When was the last time someone did something unexpectedly nice for you? Not someone you knew, but a total stranger? It's happened to me a few times, but two instances really stand out.
A few years ago, I was dining out with a person who kept going on and on about himself, completely unaware of the fact that I was sitting there in misery . It wasn't his company that disappointed me. I was recovering from a bad grade in my study. I could have collapsed in tears right there at the table.
When we picked up the check, the waitress said, ""Your meal was already paid for."" My friend and I didn't have a clue how it happened. Then I remembered a man coming in out of the corner of my eye. He was dressed in mostly white, sat down at the bar, had a glass of wine, stayed for maybe ten minutes and then left. The waitress said, ""Yes, the gentleman who was in here a while ago paid for you.""
Just last year, I was running a half-marathon. With just 0.1 miles to go, I was out of gas. Runners call it ""hitting the wall""; I thought I couldn't move another muscle. Out of nowhere, a teenager jogged up next to me and said, ""What's your name sweetie? Jennifer? Okay, Jennifer, let's go! Come on! It's just around the corner! You can do it!"". And he ran with me until I picked up my pace. I found him at the finish line to thank him for the encouragement only to learn he wasn't even supposed to be in the race that day. He was running in place of someone else.
I still shake my head when I think of these momentary angels that came to me at my point of need. Do you have any experiences like this?",high19140.txt
