0,B,"['Photographs must be put in bedroom.', ""Taking family pictures on a child's first day of school."", 'Dad always drove children to their school.', 'Each girl of the family has a large box of bows.']",What's the author's family tradition?,"Throughout life,change is the only thing that seems constant.Change has come to my 1ife many ways,in myself,and in my surroundings.At the same time,some things stay the same.This is when traditions are formed.I am often reminded of this by the photograph that sits by my bed.
It all began with a kiss on my very first day of school.I remember dancing around the mirror,watching as my dark blue dress created a teacup around my waist.I admired the little ruffle of my shirt collar and how it matched perfectly with the trim at the bottom of my dress.I knew I would be the envy of all my classmates.
    But somehow,something was missing.I reached under my bed for the large box of bows ,in every color1 imaginable,that I was famous for.I picked out a white one that would match my shirt and carefully ran to my mom.She fastened the finishing touch to my short brown hair and I was ready for my very first day of school.
    After admiring myself in the mirror,I heard my mom yell,""picture time!"" I dashed downstairs where my mum led to the spot.I  ly loved getting my picture taken.
After several individual shots and some with my older sister,Katherine,my dad came for a picture with us together.As I climbed onto my dad's lap,he wrapped his arms around Katherine and me and we both leaned in to kiss him on the cheek.At that moment,mum snapped the shot and our tradition began.
From them on,every year when the first day of school rolled around,we continued our tradition of pictures in the yard.The picture grew with my family;when my two younger sisters began school,our tradition expanded from 15 minutes to 45.The mass chaos was directed by my mom when my dad was already off to work or away on a business trip.",high17845.txt
