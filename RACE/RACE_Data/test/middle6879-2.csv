2,D,"['It can be use for decoration.', 'It can stop birds from flying into windows.', 'It can helps students become more patient.', 'It can organize a paper cutting art competition.']",Which of the following statements is NOT the function of the papercutting art according to the passage?,"The corridor   windows at the Hangzhou Entel Foreign Language School look a bit different from other schools. They are all decorated   with beautiful paper cutting art. But they are not just for decoration. They are also to stop birds from flying into windows.
Chen Zitong, 14, a Junior 3 student at the school came up with the idea. In early January, she wrote a letter to the headmaster and suggested this. She often saw birds fly into the clean windows and get hurt. After some online research, she found this solution. ""Some people decorated windows with stickers   or posters. Then I thought of replacing   them with our traditional paper cutting art,"" Chen said.
To Chen's surprise, the headmaster took her advice. The school organized a paper cutting art competition. Students' works that got awards were pasted on the corridor windows.
In fact, there have been paper cutting art classes since 2011. ""We have classes once a week for a month to teach paper cutting,"" said Fan Ming, an art teacher. The teaching building even has a display   wall to show students' works.
Through the class, Shi Jiawei, 14, fell in love with the art of paper cutting. ""It's very fun. I can design my own patterns   and present interesting things through it,"" she said. She created many works like bears and magpies  .
Paper cutting also helps students become more patient. Wang Yiyou, 12, was once an active boy. But now, he can carefully design a delicate   paper cutting work with scissors   and gravers  . ""I am so proud that I can make it look perfect,"" he said.
