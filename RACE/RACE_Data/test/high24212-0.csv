0,B,"['he was badly wounded in the battle', 'he was unable to work like ordinary people', 'he was too proud to get on well with other people', 'he was waiting for his chance']",Francis Blustering lived a poor life because   _  .,"After the first World War, a small group of veterans   returned to their village in Britain. Most of them managed to get along fairly well, but one--Francis Blustering, who had been wounded and who never recovered his strength-- was unable to work like others. In time he became very poor. Yet he was too proud to accept anything from the people in the village. 
Once, these veterans held a reunion dinner in the home of Jules Grandin, who had made a good deal of money. Grandin produced a curiosity --a large old gold coin. Each man examined it with interest as it passed around the long table. All, however, had drunk wine freely and the room was full of noisy talk, so that the gold piece was soon forgotten. Later, when Grandin remembered it and asked for it, the coin was missing.
One of them suggested everyone be searched, to which all agreed, except Blustering. ""You refuse, then?"" asked Grandin. Blustering said with a red face, ""Yes, I cannot allow it.""
One by one, the others turned out their pockets. When the coin failed to appear, attention was focused on poor Blustering. Under the pitying stares of his friends, he walked out and returned to his home.
A few years later, Grandin made his house repaired. A workman found the gold coin, buried in dirt between planks   of the floor. Hurrying to Blustering's home, Grandin apologized to him. 
""But why didn't you allow yourself be searched?""
""Because I was a thief,"" Blustering said brokenly. ""For weeks we had not had enough to eat and my pockets were full of food that I had taken from the table to carry home to my wife and hungry children.""",high24212.txt
