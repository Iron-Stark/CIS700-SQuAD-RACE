2,D,"['not being delighted for what you have got and not feeling pity on the lost', 'think twice before you leap', 'treat everything calmly', ""cherish what you've owned""]",What the author wanted to tell us is that   _  .,"Several years ago I worked in an office, which had a locust tree growing outside the window. It had grown into a tall tree and must have been there for a long time. The tree blocked the view and made the office seem dull, unfortunately this happened to be the room assigned to me and I was depressed by it for quite some time.
 When the first spring came, everything was green except the locust tree. Secretly, I was very happy because I had thought it had died.
 One morning when I opened the window for fresh air, I unexpectedly smelt a familiar sweet scent floating into my office but I couldn't name it. Suddenly, I realized it was the locust tree! The tree that I thought dead was blossoming in full glory.
 From then on, I usually came to the office very early to see dew forming on the locust tree blossoms and every year was eager to see spring again.
 During summer, the green leaves provided shade protecting me from the harsh sunlight, but allowing enough light in to make it pleasant. In autumn, the leaves turned into many different color1s. Its beauty touched my soul. Many times I thought to take photos but never did. Then I had to leave in a hurry. Later in life it became a great regret that I had not done so.
 Actually, many times in our lives, we think we own something, therefore we don't cherish it. We don't feel regretful until we lose it one day! Moreover, sometimes, we have to accept the things we don't want and need to discover the hidden beauty to find unexpected joy!",high20379.txt
