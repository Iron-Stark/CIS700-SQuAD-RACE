3,D,"['Jack himself.', ""Jack's mother."", 'Park guard.', 'An actress.']",Who might be the person that screamed?,"On the way home from school, Jack always passes a park. His mother said it was dangerous to pass by the park at night, but it is the fastest way home. Today, after finishing soccer practice, Jack was walking toward the park as usual.
Suddenly, Jack heard someone calling him, ""Excuse me!"" Jack turned around, and there was an old woman. ""Yes, ma'am."" Jack answered politely. ""Don't pass by the park tonight."" Her voice was weak and dry. ""Okay, ma'am,"" said Jack carelessly. The old woman held Jack's hand strongly, and said, ""I mean it!"" Jack felt the hairs on his neck stand up. As soon as the lady let go of his hand, he started to run. This time, he ran so fast that he didn't have time to think where he was going.
When he stopped, he realized he was in the middle of the park. He remembered what the old woman had said, but it was too late. He thought, ""It would be okay if I run really fast."" Suddenly, he heard someone scream . Jack was too frightened to wonder who it was. He breathed as deep as possible. The screaming continued. He heard some fast footsteps approaching, so he turned around. It was the old lady! She walked toward him, and shouted ""I told you not to come here!""
Frightened to death, Jack screamed sharply and ran home like an arrow. He thought he heard not only the old lady, but also some other people shouting at him, and it made him more terrified. As soon as Jack saw his mother, Jack said, ""Mom! Do you know what just happened at the park?"" Jack's mother nodded, and said, ""Yes, I know. There is a movie shooting tonight in the park.""",high23332.txt
