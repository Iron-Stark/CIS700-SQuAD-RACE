2,C,"[""Try to look happy and you'll be better."", 'I know exactly how you feel.', 'I had a similar experience.And it might help you.', 'Cheer up and get rid of your depression.']",What are you advised to say to a depressed person?,"Depressed people can be very difficult to be around,and yet they need more than the usual amount of support and understanding from their friends and family.
The anger and lack of concern that a depressed person may have for people close to him or her can be very disturbing to someone who's trying to help.At such times,the sincerity of a friend or a family member is questioned when the depressed person doesn't feel worthy of someone's friendship.Withdrawal from others can make it nearly impossible to encourage a depressed person to enter into activities that may help pull him or her out of the depression.
It is frequently difficult for a depressed person to carry on a conversation.Attempts to help may be met with defensiveness and verbal attacks.While being supportive and understanding,the friend of a family member must be careful not to do too many things for the depressed person.There is a very thin line between being supportive and being overly protective.Too much""doing for"" can be a disservice .
You can best help a friend or relative who is depressed by considering the following points:
*Do not moralize.Don't pressure him or her to ""put on a happy face,"" or to ""snap out of it."" Often the person will feel even worse after hearing such words.
*When you are alone with your depressed friend,you might say something like,""I've noticed lately that you seem down.I care about you and would like to listen to what you're thinking about."" Then be a good listener.
*Don't say,""I know exactly how you feel."" You probably don't.But if you've had similar experiences,sharing those may help.Say things like,""This happened to me.It might help you."" Or ""I know some of what you must be feeling.""
*Urge him or her to get professional help if necessary.Offer to accompany your friend on the first visit if it will be easier for the person.",high6995.txt
