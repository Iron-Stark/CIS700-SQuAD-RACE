1,D,"['All models are happy about the law.', 'All advertising agencies are happy about the law.', 'The law makes no sense.', 'There are arguments over the beauty standard of models.']",What can we know from the passage?,"Israel has passed a law banning the use of underweight models in advertising. Known as the ""Photoshop Law"", it also requires that agencies tell their audience if they've digitally changed pictures to make models look thinner.
The new law forbids the use of models with a body mass index of 18.5 or less, a standard based on internationally accepted measures. The figure matches the set of fixed limits by the U. S. Department of Health.
The law doesn't set a money amount that can be gained in court from such a _ . Lawmakers realize that it may be a long and difficult process to prove in court that a company broke the new law, but they feel that simply having the law in place will accomplish what they want; stopping advertising companies from continuing to influence Israelis with images of unhealthy-looking models as the gold standard of beauty.
Some modeling agencies in Israel aren't happy. They say that the indexes on which the law is based are arbitrary  and are not suitable for every model. Many models who are totally healthy girls might be disqualified because of the law.

""I think this is fantastic because so many young women and men are suffering to look in a way that is unrealistic and unhealthy,"" she said.",high5349.txt
