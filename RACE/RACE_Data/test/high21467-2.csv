It may be open to discussion which city is the most beautiful in the world. But in terms of "" the most livable"", Melbourne has ranked top in a survey done by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) in August. In fact, four cities Down Under are among the top ten most livable cities.
The climate in Australia is warm and mild, particularly in major coastal cities. As a result, people spend much time outdoors. They go to the beach, to the countryside, or play sports outdoors in fields. 
Take Melbourne for example. The city features many open green spaces and beautiful long beaches. Melburnians 
(people from Melbourne) have a strong love for sports. The city hosts the annual Australia Open, 
the Formula One Grand Prix, cricket, rugby and homegrown football. It is also home to museums, art exhibitions and drama festivals.

During the 2003 Rugby World Cup, the level of support they showed for the Japanese team surprised viewers since Japan had little hope of winning. 
""Australians don't need to be victorious in order to feel like a worthy person. When they cheer for the underdog, seeing other human beings having the courage to take on hardship, they get the emotional satisfaction they need,"" wrote a blogger on convictcreations.com, a website dedicated to Australian culture.",high21467.txt
