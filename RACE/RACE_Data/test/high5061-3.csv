3,D,"['Because they want to breathe fresh air outside.', ""Because there's a fire in the living room."", 'Because they wear heavy clothing all day long.', 'Because the sun there shines a lot.']",Why is it important to keep the heat out of the houses in southern Europe?,"What does the word ""home"" mean to you? How do you say the word in French? In Spanish? In your language? Although people usually know what the word means, it often has no exact translation. It's not surprising really, because the idea of home differs from country to country, and from person to person. A home is more than a roof and four walls. It's the cooking, eating, talking, playing and family living that go on inside, which are important as well. And at home you usually feel safe and relaxed.
But it's not just that homes look different in different countries, they also contain different things and reveal  different attitudes and needs. For example, in cold northern Europe, there's a fire in the living room or kitchen and all the chairs face it. In the south, where the sun shines a lot and it's more important to keep the heat out, there are small windows, cool stone floors and often no carpets. We asked some people about their homes.
