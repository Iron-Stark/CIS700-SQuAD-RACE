1,C,"['the Teddy Bear had a sweet face', 'Anna and the writer were friends again at last', 'the writer loved Aunt Reba deeply', 'best friends always ask something in return']",From the passage we learn   _  .,"Ann was my best friend. She had come to play half an hour ago, and I didn't want her to go. ""Your mother said you could stay an hour."" I said.
Ann pointed at the Teddy Bear on my desk. ""I'll stay if you give me your Teddy Bear."" she said.
I couldn't imagine giving it to her. It was a special gift from Aunt Reba on my tenth birthday. My aunt was a beautiful and kind woman who was never too busy to spend time with me. The day she died, I cried for hours, unable to believe that I would never see her again. Now, when I saw the Teddy Bear, I was filled with memories  of Aunt Reba.
""Come on,"" Ann shouted, ""I'm your best friend.""
I don't know what came over me, but I really wanted someone to play with me. So I handed Ann the Teddy Bear! Then, she stayed.
That evening I went to bed without dinner. The memories of Aunt Reba brought tears to my eyes. How _ I felt. I was sad all night.
Alone in the dark, I asked myself, ""Is Ann really my best friend?""
At school the next day, I found Ann. I asked for the Teddy Bear. She was surprised at first. Then she thought for a few seconds and finally said, ""Okay, I don't like it anyway.""
After that, Ann and I stopped playing together. Through the years, I have had other best friends. I have come to understand that best friends are people who want to spend time with you, and they ask nothing in return.",middle3684.txt
