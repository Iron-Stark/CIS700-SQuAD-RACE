1,C,"['Confused.', 'Satisfied.', 'Bored.', 'Terrified.']",How did the author feel about life before the night sitting on the porch with the family?,"Crazy is our new normal. With two teenage boys and three little boys, our family is restless--to the baseball field, track field and piano lessons. Even though we've limited each boy's activities and try our best to defend our family time, it seems that we're in a constant state of flight.
""Embrace it. Roll with it,"" my husband, Lonny, says, ""It's going to be like this for a while.""
He is right. It's likely that life will continue to go forward before it slows down. But I remembered the still, quiet days that our family used to enjoy. I missed long walks through the park when we held the boys' little hands. I longed for  lazy Saturday afternoons under the tree in our backyard. I wanted to slip back a few years, when busyness was the exception and not the rule.
One night, after a particularly full day and evening games, our family gathered on the porch for ice cream. Two parents, two teens, and three small boys piled on one old swing and a couple of rocking chairs. We were together, in one place, for a small slice of time.
The moon was full. The Mississippi River, flowing past our home, was smooth as glass. I wrapped my own arms around the son who sat on my lap and breathed deeply to _ his little-boy scent --dirt and sweat. My heart was still and content .
I realized that while crazy is our new normal happiness is as usual. They may look different from before, but they are still there--even if they're in the form of a single moment on the porch. Maybe I just need the eyes to see.",high15048.txt
