1,A,"['The number of violence and crime is increasing every year.', 'Because many people carry guns.', 'Because there too many films.', 'Because people are not able to defend themselves.']",Why does the writer say the world is dangerous?,"We live in a dangerous world. The figures for crime go up year by year. If you were attacked in the street, would you be able to defend yourself? Not very well probably, especially if someone was pointing a gun at you. We all see a lot of violence of films, but recently some programs on television showed how people can defend themselves without guns. For example, in one film a woman was attacked from behind. She threw the man, who was heavier and stronger than she was, over her head. Then she held him tightly on the ground. How? She knew Judo.
Jiu-jitsu, as judo is sometimes called, means ""muscle science"" in Japanese. The student of judo needs to learn a lot about the body, its bones and muscles. Judo uses a number of ""falls"", ""holds"" and ""throws"". Someone who does not know judo cannot defend himself against them. If you know judo you can defend yourself against a person who is stronger than you. You had better not practice judo on your friends unless they can fall without hurting themselves! Being strong is one thing, but using the body wisely is another. In judo, you use the other person's body to help you. You ""throw"" him to the ground and ""hold"" him there, so that he cannot move. Of course, it takes time and practice, but knowing judo is useful. In a violent world you ought to be able to defend yourself.",high3530.txt
