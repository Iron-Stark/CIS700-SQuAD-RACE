1,B,"[""people are born the way they'll always be"", 'a person can try to change his/her personality', 'personality decides what a person looks like', 'blood type decides what a person will be like']",We know that  _  from the passage.,"Wonder why you can get angry so easily while your friend smiles all the time? It's probably because you both have different personalities .
Personality is also about how people think, behave, and react   to everything around them from day to day.
So what makes people think and behave in certain ways?
Part of the reason is that people are born like this. A baby gets its blood type, genes   and other physical things when it's still inside its mother. These things may help decide what the baby will be like.
But one's personality doesn't stop here. Family life, school learning and life experiences can also make you the person you are. This doesn't mean it's impossible to change your personality. You can always try to make yourself better. Don't get too worried about your shortcomings  . Just accept them. This is a good way to start making changes.
If you don't know how to make friends, find out why. Is it because you're too shy? Tell yourself to smile at people. Start talking to people using warm greetings.
Don't give yourself a hard time about it all. It's not easy to change lifelong habits in one night. Keep working at it. One day you'll see that you can turn over a new leaf and be a new you!",middle1555.txt
