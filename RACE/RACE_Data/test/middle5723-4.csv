4,A,"['Two Dogs', ""Sue's Dog"", 'A Pleasant Meeting', ""Sue's Friend""]",Which of the following can be the best title of the passage?,"One day when Jack was walking in the park, he saw a woman, who lived a few miles away, sitting on a bench  with a dog beside her. The dog was looking up at the woman.
Jack walked up to the woman and said, ""Hello, Sue, how are you? May I sit and talk with you for a while?"" ""Of course, please sit down,"" Sue said. Jack sat down next to Sue on the bench, and they talked quietly together. The dog continued to look up at Sue, as if waiting to be fed.
""That's a nice dog, isn't he?"" Jack said, pointing  at the animal.
""Yes, he is. He's handsome. He's a bit of a mixture , but that's not a bad thing. He's strong and healthy.""
""And hungry,"" Jack said. ""He hasn't taken his eyes off you. He thinks you've got some food for him.""
""That's true,"" Sue said. ""But I haven't.""
They both laughed and then Jack said, ""Does your dog bite?""
""No,"" Sue said, ""He's never bitten anyone. He's always gentle and friendly.""
Hearing this, Jack decided to hold out his hand and touched the animal's head. Suddenly it jumped up and bit him.
""Hey!"" Jack shouted. ""You said your dog didn't bite.""
Sue answered in surprise, ""Yeah, I did. But this is not my dog. Mine's at home.""",middle5723.txt
