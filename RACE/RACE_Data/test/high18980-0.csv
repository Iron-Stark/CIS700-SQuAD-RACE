You'll discover original nature as you've never seen it before. The freedom to wander  in the city or the wilds as you please is the key to the Iceland experience.
Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, is just a part of the Icelandic experience with its midnight sun or the magical landscapes mixed with ice and fire. Reykjavik has a population of around 170,000 and offers an interesting mix of culture and local village roots.
Old accounts say the ancient gods themselves guided Iceland's first settler to make his home in Reykjavik. He named the place Reykjavik (Steamy Bay)after the geothermal steam he saw, which today heats homes and outdoor swimming pools throughout the city, a pollution-free energy source that leaves the air very fresh, clean and clear.
A beautiful river runs through the city limits, and so do fine parks and even wild outdoor areas. Against this backcloth of nature, Reykjavik has a packed program of familiar city joys too: art museums, several theaters, an opera house, a symphony orchestra and concerts meeting the needs of all ages and tastes.
One must for all visitors is dining out on Icelandic specialties, including delicious seafood, ocean-fresh from the morning' s catch, highland lamb and unusual varieties of game. Its purely natural food is imaginatively served to delight the most discerning of diners. Reykjavik is also famous as one of Europe's hottest nightspots, where the action on the friendly pub and nightlife scene lasts right through the night. In the evening, the downtown area is filled with activity, reaching its peak on Friday or Saturday. The number of pubs, cafe, discos, and other nightspots in the downtown area is astonishing. There is a rich variety of places to go: European-style cafes, nightclubs with live entertainment, dance halls for seniors, sports-theme pubs with big TV screens, cafes that offer over 100 types of beer, an Irish pub, a Spanish cafe, a French wine bar.
Walking distances are short downtown, and everything worth seeing outside the city center can be quickly and conveniently reached by bus. With its long, easy-going main street and large shopping mall, Iceland's capital is a great place to shop too -- with a bonus of tax-free shopping for visitors!
 A full range of accommodations is available in Reykjavik, from international-standard hotels with good conference facilities, through smaller hotels and comfortable guesthouses, to a campsite in the city's biggest park.",high18980.txt
