0,D,"['To rob her.', 'To scare her.', 'To make friends with her.', 'To return her wallet.']",Why was the black man running after the writer?,"In 1969 I was a young girl working in Toronto. I was from a small town in Ontario and had just moved to the big city about three months earlier. It was one week before Christmas and I was going home on the last streetcar of the evening. 
   I remember looking at my paycheque  and asking myself how it was going to endure. At that time in my life I hardly had enough money to exist on. Bread for supper and oatmeal for breakfast was the only way I kept hunger at bay.
   I got off the streetcar and started walking up the street, when I suddenly noticed a man was running after me. I stopped, turned around, seeing that he was black. I  _ , ""What do you want?"" The man answered in a soft voice, ""I am returning your wallet. You left it on the streetcar seat.""
   Because of that man's thoughtfulness, I was allowed the comfort of going home by bus for the summer holidays. Otherwise, I would have stayed alone in my small room with a hog plate. 
   I have never been so ashamed of myself, and that poor, kind man had to walk, who knows how far, home. 
   I recognized immediately that this was wrong of me and it changed my ways forever.",high20904.txt
