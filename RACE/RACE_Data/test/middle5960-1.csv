1,C,"['Billy is living with a generous person.', 'Billy has found his brother.', 'Billy bought a diamond ring.', 'Billy appeared in the new report.']",Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the passage?,"On February 9 th,2013,Sarah Darling was walking along the street when she met a homeless man named Billy Ray Harris.She reached into her change purse,emptied out all the coins she had and gave them to the homeless man.Neither of them realized that this small generous act would change their lives.
Sarah didn't realize that she had given Billy not only all her change but also her diamond ring that she had put in her change purse earlier until the following morning.She and her husband,Bill Krejci,rushed to see if they could find Billy.The homeless man was not only in the same place,he also immediately returned the ring.The grateful couple paid him back for his honesty by emptying out their pockets of all the money they had.
Bill Krejci,a web designer,felt that he needed to do something more for this amazingly
honest man.So on February 18th,he set up a special page to raise money for him.In just four days,Billy received over $ 85,000 and there seems to be no end yet.
That is not enough.Billy is 1iving with a person who is generous instead of living in the streets.And that's not all--thanks to the news report,he got together again with his older brother,Edwin Harris who he had been unable to find for 27 years.
All the good luck is just because Billy did the right thing--returning something that did not belong to him.",middle5960.txt
