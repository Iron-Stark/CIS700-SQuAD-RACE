4,D,"['What a Big Fence!', 'Farmer and Bridge', 'Three Kind Men', 'A Fence or a Bridge?']",What is the best title for the passage?,"Farmer John and Farmer Bob were neighbors. For more than 30 years, they had been getting along very well.
Then their good relationship broke. It began with a small thing, then bitter words, and then weeks of silence. One morning Farmer John woke up to find a stream between the two farms. ""It must be Bob,"" John thought.
Then one day there was a knock on John's door. He opened it to find a carpenter  standing at the doorway.
""I'm looking for a few days' work,"" the carpenter said.
""I do have a job for you,"" John said. ""Look across the stream at that farm. That's my neighbor Bob. He dug a stream between the two farms. I want you to build a fence--an 8-foot fence. I don't want to see his place or his face any more. I don't have such a neighbor!""
The carpenter said, ""I think I know what to do, sir, and I'll be able to do a job that pleases you.""
Farmer John helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was off for the day.
About sunset when the farmer returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. The farmer's eyes opened wide. There was no fence there at all!
It was a bridge! And the neighbor, Bob, was coming across, with his hand outstretched . ""Hi, John! _ 
Then they met in the middle, taking each other's hands. ""I'm terribly sorry for what I have said and done. We should be good to each other,"" said Farmer Bob.
Then they turned to see the carpenter, who was ready to go. ""No, wait! Stay a few days. I have a lot of other jobs for you,"" said Farmer John. ""I'd love to stay,"" the carpenter said, ""but I have more bridges to build.""",high5471.txt
