0,A,"['literature.', 'peace', 'physics', 'chemistry']",Mo is the first Nobel winner in   _   born and living in China.,"Mo, the first Nobel winner in literature born and living in China, said he had trouble with the sudden publicity, which put a lot of pressure on him.
""I only hope to return to my writing desk as soon as possible, and I would also like to do well in society anonymously. "" Mo said. He was bothered by a large number of requests asking him to offer help that took advantage of his fame. "" I was upset the first several days after the prize announcement, but then I realized the prize is just like a mirror that reflects various attitudes about my winning, and more, reflects the real me,"" Mo said. ""I still consider myself an ordinary citizen who writes. And presenting quality works is my duty and best way of giving back to society. I'm no superstar,"" he emphasized  several times.
Mo believes Chinese literature has achieved much in the past thirty years, and the driving force behind that is not the prize. Writers' creations should not be driven by awards, or criticism, or readers' expectations. Mo said he misunderstood the standards of the academy's selection before he visited Stockholm  to receive the prize in December.
""I thought they were judging the authors' personality or political features, then I learned the sole standard of their selection is literature itself, which is also deeply based in the Swedish people's long-established practice of reading a large number of books,"" Mo said.
During the forum, established Chinese and Australian writers discussed subjects as diverse as tradition and modernity, the local and the universe and cultural inclusiveness. And they will also read works to each other and the readers. The writers communication will further promote  Chinese writers to a global audience.
Australian Ambassador  to China Frances Adamson agreed. ""It's a milestone  of literary exchanges between the two countries, who are longtime friends,"" Adamson said.",middle1728.txt
