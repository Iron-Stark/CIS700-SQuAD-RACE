1,A,"['allows too many branches to grow in the middle', 'does not protect them from wind', 'forces them to grow too quickly', 'damages some of the small side branches']",Trees become unhealthy if the gardener   _  .,"Trees should only be pruned when there is a good and clear reason for doing so and , fortunately, the number of such reasons is small.
First, pruning may be done to make sure that trees have a desired shape or size.The object may be to get a tree of the right height, and at the same time to help the growth of small side branches which will thicken its appearance or give it a special shape.Secondly, pruning may be done to make the tree healthier.You may cut diseased or dead wood, or branches that are rubbing against each other and thus cause wounds.The health of a tree may be encouraged by removing branches that are blocking up the centre and so preventing the free movement of air.
One result of pruning is that an open wound is left on the tree and this provides an easy entry for disease, but it is a wound that will heal .Often there is a race between the healing and the disease as to whether the tree will live or die.It should be the aim of every gardener to reduce the risk as far as possible.It is necessary to make the area which has been pruned, smooth and clean, for healing will be slowed down by roughness .You should allow the cut surface to dry for a few hours and then paint it with one of the substances available from garden shops produced especially for this purpose.Pruning is usually done in winter, ""From then you can see the shape of the tree clearly and it is, too, very unlikely that the cuts you make will bleed.If this does happen, it is, of course, impossible to paint them properly.",high10682.txt
