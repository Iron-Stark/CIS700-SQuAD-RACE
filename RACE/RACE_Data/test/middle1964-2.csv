2,D,"['People can understand you better when they know you are shy.', ""Most people don't like to talk to those people with angry faces."", ""Don't care what you look like at the party or the game."", 'Each time after you smile at someone for the first time, you should buy yourself an ice cream.']",Which of the following is NOT true?,"If you think you are too shy and want to be a little outgoing, try the following. You can make it.
Tell people you are shy. Just let people know that you are a shy kid. When they know that, they'll understand you better. This also helps you feel more at home when talking with others.
Try to smile more. People think you are friendly and easy to talk to. Remember that most of us would like to talk to friendly people and we will stay away from an angry-looking face.
Talk to others first. If you find it hard to do, say something nice about people around you. Think about how great you feel when someone says something nice to you. Doesn't it make you want to keep talking to those people?
Turn your attention to somewhere else. Think more about ways to enjoy the party or the game. Don't worry about your looks or care if people like you.
Reward  yourself. Each time after you say ""hi"" or smile at someone for the first time , say to yourself ""You did it!"" or buy yourself an ice cream.
Keep trying and one day you won't be shy any more when you talk to others.",middle1964.txt
