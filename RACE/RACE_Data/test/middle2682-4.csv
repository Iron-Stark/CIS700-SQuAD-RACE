4,C,"['Because they are happy', 'Because they are tired', 'Because they go home for supper', 'Because they have some homework to do']",Why do the students go home at about six p.m.?,"Today is Sunday. Our class meets at seven thirty a.m. at the school gate. We take a bus to Haian Park. The price of the ticket  for each adult  is eighteen yuan, but for each student is half. The park is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. First we play games in the park. And then we have dinner at noon. After that we sit and chat under the trees. At half past three, we go to the Swimming Club. We come back home at about six o'clock in the afternoon because  it is time for all of us to have supper. We are tired  but we are very happy.",middle2682.txt
