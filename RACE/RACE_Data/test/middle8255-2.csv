2,C,"['Be different from other teenagers.', 'Pay no attention to whatever her parents tell her.', 'Discuss her problem with her parents.', ""Don't tell her parents what she wants to do.""]",What advice does Dr Jackson give to Angel?,"Dear Dr Jackson,
My parents are never happy with me. They are always criticizing my clothes, my hair and the music I listen to. They hate my friends' looks and they keep complaining when I go with them. I'm not allowed to stay out as late as my friends do, so I can't have any fun. My parents only seem to care about my school grades. Although I love them, sometimes I feel we live in different worlds. If they love me, can't they understand me? How can I make them understand me?

Dear Angel,
Your problem is common to both teenagers and parents. Don't worry, because all this is natural. You see, your parents have grown up at a different time and they have different experiences. So, they think some things are strange, but you find the same things are all right. For example, the music you like may sound like noise to them. Your parents love you, so they feel they must stop you from doing whatever they find strange. On the other hand, you don't want to be different from other teenagers, so you feel that your parents
you.
I think you should talk about this problem with your parents. Try to explain to them what you want and make them know they can believe you. And then they'll find you are a responsible person and they will give you more freedom.
