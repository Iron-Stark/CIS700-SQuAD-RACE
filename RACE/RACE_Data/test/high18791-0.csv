0,C,"['He is a Mississippian.', 'He is a first-time hunter.', 'He will share out the alligator meat.', 'He fought the alligator for 12 hours.']",Which of the following is true about Dustin Bockman?,"Hunters in Mississippi broke a state record for the heaviest alligator  ever killed, kicking off the hunting season with two big catches.
Dustin Bockman of Wisconsin and two hunting friends caught the 727-pound 13-foot-long beast on Sunday, beating last year's record-setter by 26 pounds, according to the state's Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks.
""We're going to cook it for sure."" he told Gulf Live.
""There's plenty for me and everybody else.""
He and his team of hunters followed the huge creature for 12 hours until they could get close enough to shoot him with a crossbow.
""He would go to the bottom and sit like a piece of wood. You could do anything with him,"" Bockman said.
The hunters then had  to figure out how to drag the beast's dead body into their boat.
It look four hours of pulling  at which point they rested on a sandbar  and called friends for help.
First-time hunter Beth Trammell initially broke the record when she caught a 723-pound 13-foot gator with a team of six hunters, but Bockman stole her thunder hours later.
She was shocked at her gator's size. ""It took about four hours to get it in the boat,"" she said. ""We had to ask another boat to help us out  it was so big.""
She said that she, too, was going to eat the beast and use it for decoration.
""I think my brother-in-law is going to get the head mounted."" she said.
Alligators nearly died out in Mississippi in the 1960s, but a conservation  helped the creature recover to the point that hunting is now legal.",high18791.txt
