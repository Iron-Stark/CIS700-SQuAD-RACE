2,B,"['stories making readers sleepless', 'valuable ones bought on sale', 'peculiar ones with great expectation', 'geography ones from the eighteenth century']",The books preferred by the author should be those_.,"With a good shopping position and the right amount of money , any educated person ought to be able to make a living out of a bookshop . It is not a difficult trade to learn and the large chain-stores can never force the small bookseller out of existence as they have done to the corner shop . But the hours of work are very long-I was only doing a part-time job , but my boss put in a seventy-hour week ,besides regular journeys out of shopping hours to buy books . 
              The real reason why I should not like to be back in the book trade for life , however , is that while I was in it, I lost my love of books . A bookseller cannot always tell the truth about his books , and that gives him a dislike for them . There was a time when I really did love books--loved the sight and smell and feel of them--if they were fifty or more years old , that is . Nothing pleased me quite so much as to buy a bargain lot of them on sale for several pounds . There is a peculiar flavour about the unexpected books you pick up in that kind of collection: little-known eighteenth-century poets , or out-of-date geography books . For occasional reading--in your bath , for example , or late at night when you are too tired to go to bed--there is nothing as good as a very old picture story-book . 
              But as soon as I went to work in the bookshop, I stopped buying books . Seen in a mass, five or ten thousand at a time , books were dull and even a little tiresome . Nowadays I do buy one occasionally , but only if it is a book that I want to read and can't borrow , and I never buy rubbish .",high24053.txt
