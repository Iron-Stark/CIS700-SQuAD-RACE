0,B,"['A person drinking tea regularly will not be likely to suffer from cancer.', 'Once a smoker has stopped smoking, there is almost no chance for cancers.', 'A balanced diet is absolutely effective in preventing one from getting cancer.', 'Those having quitted smoking for 10 years and non-smokers have less cancer risk.']",Which of the following is true according to the author?,"Scientists estimate that more than 60 percent of cancer deaths in the United States are preventable through lifestyle changes. Although there is no certain way to avoid all cancers, reducing individual risk factors greatly decreases the likelihood of getting many forms of this dangerous disease.
The American Chemical Society estimates that smoking causes nearly 30 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States -- that is, about 166,000 cancer deaths each year. All cancer deaths caused by tobacco smoking could be prevented completely by not smoking and not using smokeless tobacco. For those who already smoke, quitting will reduce the risk of developing cancer. Studies show that after about ten years of not smoking, a past smoker's risk lowers to about the level of those who have never smoked.
After quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet is the best way to lower the risk of cancer. Certain foods have been found to protect against cancer. Among these foods are cabbages, tomatoes, soy products, and foods high in vitamins A, C, and E. In addition, green and possibly black teas contain compounds that protect the body from cancer-causing substance.
To lower cancer risk, diets should include little or no red meat. Other foods to avoid or consume in moderation   include sugar, fat from animal products, and salt. Added fats and oils should come from vegetables, such as olives or corn, rather than from animal sources. Carbohydrates   should come from whole grains, such as brown rice and whole wheat bread, rather than from processed foods, such as white rice and white bread.
The risk of cancer of the esophagus   increases with heavy alcohol consumption, and many studies suggest that consuming alcoholic drinks increases the risk of breast cancer as well. Studies show that limiting intake to two drinks a day for men, and one drink per day for women, reduces cancer risk.
Low levels of physical activity have been implicated   in some cancer. Moderate activity for 30 minutes a day enhances the immune system, shortens the time food takes to move through the intestines  , and changes body composition and hormone levels. Researchers are studying how these effects might lower cancer risk.",high16287.txt
