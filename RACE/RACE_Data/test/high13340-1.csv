1,D,"['asking for help from the police force', 'donating a lot of money', 'picking it up near the house', 'searching on the Internet']",Chester got the dog Juno by   _  .,"The story of Juno and Lucas is one of the most touching stories about the amazing relationship between humans and their companion animals.
Juno is a Belgian Malinois . The dog was beautiful but was given up by its owners, as they did not want to take on the responsibility.
Lucas, a little boy, had a strange illness, a condition that stops the body's ability to process enzymes .As his life continues, he will lose the ability to speak and his physical and mental abilities will degrade till he is left in a vegetative state. The average life expectancy for the patients is 15 years.
Chester, the boy's father, wanted his child to enjoy his life on earth as much as possible and looked into getting a service dog for the child. However, Lucas wasn't a good candidate due to his deteriorating abilities, not to mention the $15,000 cost of the animal.
Not terrified by all of this, Chester looked into adopting a dog for his son. He found Juno on a website and drove two hours to meet her. Chester had worked with the breed  in the police force and was familiar with how to train them. He put in patience and hard work, and trained Juno while allowing her to become accustomed to Lucas. Now, not only will Juno not leave Lucas' side, she is also helping with his illness. Chester said, ""She has the ability to notice his neurological changes. Now she reminds us when Lucas is about to have a seizure  or if his oxygen levels drop really low. She has saved him several times.""
Companion animals are beautiful things and they establish a bond that can't be described without experiences. I know that I held my adopted dog a little closer after hearing this story. There are a lot of dogs out there that need good homes and that won't be as lucky as Juno. So, if you think you're prepared, you should consider giving one a nice home.",high13340.txt
