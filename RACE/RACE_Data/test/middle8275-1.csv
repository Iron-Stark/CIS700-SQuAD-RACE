A lot of teens aren't responsible ,and that's where I'm different. Not just about school but everyday things like being able to pay my own credit card bills on time.
The first time I got a cartoon book was on my third birthday. From then on , I fell in deep love with it. And can you guess how many cartoon books I've read? I don't really know the exact number. But I have three full boxes of them under my bed. I also like drawing cartoons and wish to be an art teacher in a sch001.

I'm proud of doing things my own way. So whether somebody wants me to do something or whatever it is , I feel like they're all other people's thoughts , not really mine. But like others , I love reading , too. When I first took skiing lessons , I found it exciting. For ski racing,there's no question I'm better shape than most guys . I think it's fun. I mean,it is a challenge . It's where I picked up the idea of needing a challenge always in my life. In order to improve my skiing skills,I have read many books and magazines about it. No doubt it's my dream to win gold medals in the Olympic Games.

I'm different because I prefer to drop out of the world to create my own world. I'd like to build a house on a mountain. And I choose to live without electricity, a telephone,or even indoor plumbing . I have many hobbies such as traveling,reading , writing and spending time with children. I love children because they are smart and creative. They always have many strange ideas. It makes me excited. I want to do something for Hope Project and become a country school teacher .",middle8275.txt
