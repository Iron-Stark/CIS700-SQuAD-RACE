1,C,"['Because he was not good at the piano.', ""Because the customer didn't like him."", 'Because the customer was tired of listening to the music.', 'No reason.']",Why did the customer ask him to sing a song ?,"There was a man playing the piano in a bar. He was a good piano player. People came out just to hear him play. But one night, a customer told him he didn't want to hear him just play anymore. He wanted him to sing a song.
The man said, ""I don't sing.""
But the customer was persistent . He told the bartender, ""I'm tired of listening to the piano. I want the man to sing!""
The bartender shouted. "" Hi! If you want to get paid, sing a song. The customers are asking you to sing!""
So he did. He sang a song. A piano player who had never sung in public did so for the very first time. And nobody believed that he sang so well.
He has talent he was _ ! He may have lived the rest of his life as a no-name piano player in a no-name bar, but because he had to sing, he went on to become one of the best-known entertainers in America.",middle3986.txt
