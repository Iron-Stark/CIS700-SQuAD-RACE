1,D,"[""You should not give your boss' name."", ""You should give the new worker's name first."", ""You needn't give your boss' name"", ""You should give your boss' name first""]",What should you do when you introduce a new worker to your boss?,"Every day we meet people in a number of business and social situations. And the way we meet and greet them creates an impression. It's important to do so in a proper way, no matter whether you are introducing yourself to someone, or introducing two people. To keep you aware of this, we have gathered tips on how to make a proper introduction.
*Always stand when making an introduction.
When you are seated and someone comes up to greet you, make the effort to stand up. By doing this, you show respect for yourself and for the other person.
*Always keep eye contact while making an introduction.
Many people are not aware of the value of this simple action. When you make eye contact, you are giving a confident image.
*Always introduce a person of lesser authority to one of greater authority. The most important thing to remember is to say the most important person's name first.
For example, when introducing your supervisor to a job candidate  , you would give your supervisor's name first. ""Bob Jones, may I introduce Susan Lee, who has just graduated from ABC University?""
*In a situation where rank is unimportant, an introduction is based on sex and age. A man is presented to a woman and a younger woman to an older woman.
What if you find yourself in a situation where you have forgotten the other person's name? Start with a handshake and reintroduce   yourself. When doing this, you will usually cause the other person to do the same.
However, if the other person does not take your suggestion, it is OK simply to apologize and let the person know that you cannot remember her or his name. This is not the ideal situation, of course, but it does happen to all of us. The other person should be forgiving.",high7357.txt
