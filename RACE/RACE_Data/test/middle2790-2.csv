2,B,"['dirtier', 'cleaner', 'bigger', 'smaller']",Vince's hands were a little  _   than Toby's.,"Do you know the story about Vince? It was a true story. Vince was an English boy and he was eight years old. He didn't like soap or water. Three or four times a day his mother said to him, ""Vince, your hands are very dirty again."" Go and wash them. "" But Vince never washed them well. He only put his hands in the water for a few seconds and then took them out again.
Vince's uncle and aunt lived in another city. One day they came to stay with Vince's parents, and they brought their small son, Toby, with them. Toby was seven years old and he didn't like soap or water, either. The boys sat with their parents for a few minutes and then they went outside. When they were playing, Vince looked at Toby's hands and then went back to Toby's parents and said proudly  , ""Toby's hands are dirtier than mine, ""
""Of course they are,""Toby said angrily. ""You are one year older than I am, """,middle2790.txt
