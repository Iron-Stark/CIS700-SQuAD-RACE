It is around us as we talk and play. From the moment we were born, We are surrounded by air. When we sit down, it is around us. When we go to bed, air is also around us. Wherever we are on the earth, We are surrounded by air. We live in air.
All living things need air, living things can't live without air. We can go without food or water for a few days, but we can't live for more than a few minutes without air. We breathe in air. When we are working or running, We need more air. So we breathe faster than usual. When we are asleep, We need less air.",middle1588.txt
