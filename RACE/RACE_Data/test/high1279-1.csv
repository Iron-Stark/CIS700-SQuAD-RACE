As a director, I point, I suggest, I gently push the actors in the direction  I want them to go.
In the 1986 movie Nothing in Common, Jackie Gleason's character, Max Basner, gets fired (or unemployed) from his job as a clothing salesman. The scene, shot   on a boat, shows Max's despair  about being out of work. I was looking for some gesture that would allow Max to show his feelings.
Jackie had far more experience  at everything than I did, and at first I was frightened (very much afraid). What could I possibly tell ""The Great One"" about acting? Out of fear I decided to direct by suggestion, and I sat down with Gleason to talk about the scene. ""So Max is sad, right?"" I said.
Gleason nodded.
""And he's probably still carrying his pens with his name on them --- the ones he used to hand out to his customers, right?""
Gleason nodded.
"" So what would you want to do with the pens after you were fired?"" He was silent for a moment. ""Why don't I throw them overboard (or all over the boat)?"" I stood up and turned toward the crew. "" Hey, everybody, Jackie has a wonderful idea. Let's shoot it.""
After filming the scene, Gleason called me over and said with a smile, ""Garry, what kind of wonderful idea am I going to have tomorrow?""
