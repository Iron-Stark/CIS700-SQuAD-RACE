0,B,"['Jacob Whitehill as the designer', 'a program reacting to facial expressions', 'a system to help people learn', 'a set of instruments to recognize your voice']",The newly teaching robots are more advanced because they have  _,"Teachers and textbooks  _ -- your future could be under threat from a quickly developing and very smart technology.
     University of California researchers led by Jacob White hill recently programmed teaching robots to react to facial expression. Whitehill's achievement marked a major step forward in the way people could one day learn by establishing facial expression recognition in robot teachers.
     The teaching robots or, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are computer systems that provide personalized instruction and feedback to students without human intervention. The facial expression recognition allows a computer to react according to expressions a user makes.
     He said that the system was an important development in improving learning systems.
""Classical ITS typically have a somewhat rigid architecture of 'first I ask a questions then I wait for a responses then I talk some more; then I wait for another response.' Facial expression recognition, I believe, will allow the feedback from student to teacher to happen while the robot teacher is talking,"" Whitehill said.
     Experts agree the latest developments in ITS open new possibilities for how people could learn. University of Memphis researcher, Dr Andrew Olney, who recently received a US$ I. 3 million grant to develop an ITS, said the key to future learning will be enabling interactive , one-on-one instruction.
     ""The technology can benefit these more advanced learning scenarios ,"" he said.
     Although robot teachers of varying abilities have existed for more than 30 years, ITS developments such as Whitehill's and Olney's are pushing beliefs that robots could soon be as effective as-- if not more effective than human teachers.
     ""The ITS which have been developed are already better teachers than people who have no experience,"" Olney said.
     So, what is the future for today's teachers, classrooms, and textbooks?",high20723.txt
