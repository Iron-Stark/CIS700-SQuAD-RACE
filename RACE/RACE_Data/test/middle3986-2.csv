He was a good piano player. People came out just to hear him play. But one night, a customer told him he didn't want to hear him just play anymore. He wanted him to sing a song.
The man said, ""I don't sing.""
But the customer was persistent . He told the bartender, ""I'm tired of listening to the piano. I want the man to sing!""
The bartender shouted. "" Hi! If you want to get paid, sing a song. The customers are asking you to sing!""
So he did. He sang a song. A piano player who had never sung in public did so for the very first time. And nobody believed that he sang so well.
