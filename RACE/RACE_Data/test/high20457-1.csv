1,D,"['Because more and more overseas candidates are returning home.', 'Because their qualifications are decreasing little by little.', ""Because the job markets don't need overseas workers any more."", ""Because China is raising workers' salaries on a large scale.""]",Why are overseas job candidates gradually losing their advantage?,"Beijing (Xinhua) -- In 2010, some 108,000 people returned to the Chinese mainland from abroad, a number that had risen 56.2 percent from the previous year, according to statistics recently published by the Ministry of Education.
       ""For Chinese employers, a 70 percent willingness to hire overseas workers, although that is still lower than the average rate of 76 percent for Asia, is quite a high figure when compared with the past,"" said Emma, regional director of Hays in Hong Kong and the mainland, who was in charge of the survey .
       Company executives , she said, have recently come to prefer hiring Chinese natives who have returned home after studying or working elsewhere.Expatriates  have fallen to a second choice, she said.
       In the past, expatriates and returned Chinese have earned three to four times as much money as Chinese residents who do not have overseas experience.Expatriates would often rise to the senior positions within an company, while returned Chinese could find positions as mid-level executives with   ease.
       But all overseas job candidates, especially those who lack practical experience, are gradually losing their advantages among a trend of pay increases in China.
       In 2010, the country recorded the greatest rise in wages in Asia.Of all Chinese employees surveyed that year, 68 percent said they had received a raise worth 3 percent to 10 percent of their salaries, according to the survey.
       Moreover, 51 percent of the Chinese surveyed were expecting to get raises of 6 to 10 percent in 2011, and 33 percent thought their income increase will go beyond 10 percent.
       ""Now it's common in many companies to see overseas candidates earning the same salaries as their Chinese coworkers,"" said Emma.""Even some experienced expatriates, on average, earn only 20 percent more than their Chinese peers.""
       Emma said overseas workers with little work experience no longer enjoy a great advantage over graduates of Chinese universities.But those with two to three years of work experience are still ""red-hot"".
       There are now about 45 million native Chinese living outside the country, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council said on Jun 16, 2010.",high20457.txt
