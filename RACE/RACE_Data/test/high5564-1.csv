1,B,"['Science', 'Health report', 'Education', 'Business report']",In which part of a newspaper would you most probably read this passage?,"C.O.P.D  blocks air flow through the lungs. It makes breathing difficult. The leading cause of C.O.P.D. is cigarette smoking. Experts at the National Institutes of Health in the United States say there is no cure to the damage to the lungs.
Dawn Demeo is an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. She said, ""By 2020, C.O.P.D. may be the third leading cause of death across the world.""
C.O.P.D. is a new name for emphysema  and chronic bronchitis . These are the two most common forms of the disease. Many people with C.O.P.D. have both of them. And Doctor Demeo says more women than men now die from the disease.
She is the lead author of a study by a team from Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital and the University of Bergen in Norway. The new study adds to findings that women may be more at risk than men from the damaging effects of smoking.
The team examined results from a Norwegian study of 954 people with C.O.P.D. Inga-Cecilie Soerheim co-wrote the team's findings. Doctor Soerheim says they show that women suffered the same level of C.O.P.D.as men. But the female smokers were younger and had smoked a lot less.
The team also looked at two groups among the people in the study. These were people under the age of 60 and those who had smoked for less than 20 years. In both cases, women had more serious C.O.P.D. and a greater loss of lung function  than men.",high5564.txt
