Scientists  think  that  there  are  also  two  kinds  of  people: people  who  prefer  warm  colours  and  people  who  prefer  cool  colours. The  warm  colours  are  red , orange  and  yellow.  Where  there  are  warm  colours  and  a  lot  of  lights , people  usually  want  to  be  active.  People  think  that  red , for  example , is  exciting . Sociable  people , those  who  like  to  be  with  others , like  red . Scientists  also  find  that  warm  colours  can  produce  a  comfortable  feeling  and  that  time  seems to pass quickly  in  a  room  with  warm  colours  than  with  cool  colours . So  a  warm  colour , such as red or orange , is a good choice for a living  room or restaurant.
The  cool  colours  are  green , blue  and  violet . These  colours , unlike  warm  colours , are  relaxing . Where  there  are  cool  colours , people  are  usually  quiet . People  who  like  to  spend  time  alone  often  prefer  blue . Cool  colours  are  better for offices because it  can make people  who  are  working  feel  relaxed  and  calm.",middle867.txt
