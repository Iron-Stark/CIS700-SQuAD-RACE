0,D,"[""we won't betray ourselves"", 'we eat too much turkey', 'there are bacteria in our guts', ""we don't want to look fat""]",We diet strictly after the year-end overeating because  _  .,"For years we have been dieting strictly after the year-end overeating, afraid that when summer. comes, the bigger size we have accumulated will betray how we ate. Now scientists say, it's a little bug that causes obesity .
    As the holiday season with its abundant feasting arrives, millions of food lovers are keeping an eye on their figures. But scientists have found that weight gain is not about too much Christmas
turkey or hot chocolates, but some bacteria in your guts .
    Chinese scientists recently discovered a type ofbacteria in guts that may be to blame for obesity.
    A research team led by Zhao Liping, a professor in Shanghai, has identified a precise link
between a particular kind ofbacteria and unusual weight gain.
    ""The endotoxin  released by the bacterium can activate  a gene that helps produce fat. And it also deactivates a gene that consumes fat,"" Zhao says.
    Scientists have long believed that microscopic organisms in the gut, microbiota, may play a very important role in weight gain, but they had never been able to prove it.
    In 2004, American microbiologist Jeffrey Gordon and his colleagues discovered a general link between obesity and gut microbiota in mice.
    While a link was believed to exist, proving it was another matter.
    ""The list of diseases that they may play a role in is just growing and growing,"" says Lita Proctor, director of the US National Institutes of Health. ""But the problem is that we're only able to look at associations and aren't yet able to conduct cause-and-effect studies.""
     In the clinical study, researchers found a growth of too much endotoxin-producing bacteria,
leading t0 35 percent ofthe gut bacteria, in an obese patient whose initial weight was 175 kg.
     Based on this information, researchers tried to cure the patient by feeding him a specialized
nutritional liquid food to decrease the bacteria in his guts to ignorable amounts.
     After 23 weeks, the patient lost 51.4 kg, with his fatty liver disease having almost disappeared.",high23858.txt
