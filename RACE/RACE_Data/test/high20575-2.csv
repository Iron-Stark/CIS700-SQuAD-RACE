If you answered mostly Group 1: You enjoy everything about food, from cooking it to enjoying it at the table. Eating slowly is a good thing -- it gives your brain time to know when you are full. 
If you answered mostly Group 2: You can do lots of things at once. But if you eat while you're distracted  , you won't really enjoy your food and might eat more than you need. Instead of snacking while you watch TV or do homework, look for other things to do with your hands.
If you answered mostly Group 3: You're really busy. Try to make time for at least one sit-down meal a day. When you're on the go, don't eat salty, high-fat foods just because they're convenient. Pack healthy snacks in small bags that you can eat on your way out the door.",high20575.txt
