2,B,"['are often visited by parasitic wasps', 'are not occupied by mot-eating insects', 'have more green leaves', 'have more subterranean insects']",Aboveground insects will develop more quickly if their food plants   _  .,"Science Daily (Apr. 27, 2008)-- Dutch ecologist Roxina Soler and her colleagues have discovered that subterranean   and aboveground herbivorous   insects can communicate with each other by using plants as telephones.  Subterranean insects issue chemical warning signals through the leaves of the plant. This way, aboveground insects are warned that the plant is already ""occupied"".
     Aboveground, leaf-eating insects prefer plants that have not yet been occupied by subterranean root-eating insects. Subterranean insects send out chemical signals through the leaves of the plant, which warn the aboveground insects about their presence. This messaging makes it possible for spatially-separated insects to avoid each other, so that they do not compete for, the same plant.
     In recent years it has been discovered that different types of aboveground insects develop slowly if they feed on plants that also have subterranean insects and 'vice versa  . It seems that a mechanism   has developed through natural selection,  which helps the subterranean and aboveground insects to communicate with each other. This avoids unnecessary competition.
      Through the ""green telephone lines"", subterranean insects can also communicate with     _ , namely the natural enemy of caterpillars  . Parasitic wasps   lay their eggs inside aboveground insects. The wasps also benefit from the signals sent by the leaves, as these help them find more insects for their eggs.
     The communication between subterranean and above- ground insects has only been studied in a few systems. It is still not clear how widespread this phenomenon is, say the researchers.",high21993.txt
