4,C,"['The great dream of picking rocks from top of Mt. Everest', 'The number of successful Mt. Everest climbs.', 'California teen becomes youngest to climb Mt. Everest.', 'Mt. Everest climbing becomes more popular.']",What would be the best title for the passage?,"A 13-year-old American boy on Saturday became the youngest climber to conquer Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain.
Jordan Romero from Big Bear, California, climbed up the 8,850-meter summit   from the Tibetan side. On the same day, a Nepali   man, Apa Sherpa, broke his own world record of climbing Everest when he reached the summit for the twentieth time. Apa Shepa's team set off from Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, last month, heading for the base camp on the Chinese side of the mountain.
""The team has just called in and believe that they are standing on top of Mt. Everest,"" Romero's blog said. ""Their dreams have now come true. Everyone is happy.""
The climbing has put Romero one step closer to reaching his goal of climbing the highest mountains on all seven continents  . ""It is just a goal."" Romero said. He had already climbed five peaks  , and needs to climb only Vinson Massif, the highest peak in Antarctica, to hit his goal.
The youngest person before to climb Everest was 16-year-old Temba Tsheri Sherpa of Nepal. Romero climbed together with a team including his father Paul and three local guides. He wanted to pick a small piece of rock from the top of the world and wear it in a necklace. While Nepal insists that anyone planning to climb Mount Everest must be at least 16, China does not have any age restrictions  . Some mountain climbers haven't agreed with the Romero family for letting him try it but his father said the climbing from the Chinese side is less dangerous.",high17090.txt
