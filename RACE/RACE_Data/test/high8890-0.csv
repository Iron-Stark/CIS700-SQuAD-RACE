0,C,"[""They don't like to cheat patients."", 'They are not good at treating patients.', 'They find it not easier to be objective to the patients.', 'They seldom blur the relationship with patients.']","Why are ffiendl3,doctors bad for their patients'health?","Friendly doctors are""bad for their patients'health"",researchers have warned as a new study revealed two thirds of young doctors struggle to be truthful with patients they like.
Blurring(...)the lines between social and professional relationships can affect the level of care offered and prevent patients from being honest about important side effects.
""Doctors should avoid adding patients as friends on Facebook,they should not hug or allow patients to call them by their first names"".regulators have warned.""Those who break the boundaries will face some punishment.""
It comes as a survey of 338 oncologists under the age of 40,found 59 per cent said they found it difficult to tell the truth to those patients they liked.Sixty per cent of respondents said if doctors felt too close to their patients,it could prevent them from making objective decisions about a person's care.
Lesley Fallowfield,of Brighton and Sussex Medical Schoo1.said:""Oncology is a profession that can be enormously rewarding but is filled with many challenges.Young oncologists have to master dealing with anxious patients who are facing a life-threatening disease;conveying the true prognosis ;discussing the complexity of modern treatments;and explaining the unavailability of some drugs,the side-effects of treatment,and likely treatment aims.""
But she said,""Those doctors who have entered the profession in the age of the 'Internet world'are more likely to fall victim to blurring the professional boundaries with patients.
She said:""The difficulty,if you hug and kiss patients,if you allow them to call you by your first name,is that quickly the relationship can become confused as a social one rather than a professional one.Doctors become confused,'I really like this person,how can I bear to tell them that they're going to die?'They find it more difficult to be objective.""",high8890.txt
