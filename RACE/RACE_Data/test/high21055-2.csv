2,B,"['Because he wanted Farmer Joe to keep silent about the accident.', 'Because he thought it was the best way to stop the donkey from suffering.', ""Because the donkey's groaning was too loud."", 'Because he wanted to make Farmer Joe feel better.']","According to the passage, why did the policeman shot the donkey?","Farmer Joe was in his cart when he was hit by a truck. He decided his injuries from the accident were serious enough to take the trucking company to court. In court the trucking company's lawyer was questioning farmer Joe. ""Didn't you say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine'?"" said the lawyer.
Farmer Joe responded, ""Well, I'll tell you what happened. I had just loaded my favorite donkey Bessie into the...."" 
""I didn't ask for any details,"" the lawyer interrupted, ""just answer the question. Didn't you say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine'?""
Farmer Joe said, ""Well I had just got Bessie into the cart and I was driving down the road....""
The lawyer interrupted again and said, ""Judge, I am trying to establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the highway policeman on the scene that he was just fine. Now several weeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client. I believe he is a cheat. Please tell him to simply answer the question.""
By this time the Judge was fairly interested in Farmer Joe's answer and said to the lawyer, ""I'd like to hear what he has to say about his favorite donkey Bessie.""
Joe thanked the Judge and continued, ""Well, as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my favorite donkey, into the cart and was driving her down the highway when this huge semi-truck ran into the stop sign and hit my cart right in the side. I was thrown into one ditch  and Bessie was thrown into the other.""
""I was badly hurt and wasn't able to move. However, I could hear old Bessie moaning and groaning . I knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans. Shortly after the accident a highway policeman came on the scene. He could hear Bessie moaning and groaning so he went over to her. After he looked at her, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes. Then the policeman came across the road with his gun in his hand and looked at me. He said, 'Your donkey was in such bad shape, so I had to shoot her. How are you feeling?""",high21055.txt
