2,C,"['how to communicate', 'sharing personal information', 'basic rules of behavior on the Internet.', 'respecting others in the chat room.']",This passage is mainly about   _,"Just as in face-to-face communication, there are some basic rules of behavior  that should be followed on the Internet. The basic rule is simple: treat others in the same way you would want to be treated. Imagine how you'd feel if you were in the other person's shoes.
For anything you're about to send: ask yourself, "" Would I say that to the person's face?"" If the answer is no, rewrite and reread. If someone in the chat room is rude to you, you needn't to fire back. You should either ignore  the person, or use your chat software to block their messages. Remember to respect the beliefs and opinions of others in the chat room.
Everyone was new to the network once. Offer advice when asked by newcomers, as they may not be sure what to do or how to communicate. When someone makes a mistake, be kind about it. If you do decide to tell someone about the mistake, point it out politely. At the same time, if you find you are wrong, be sure to correct yourself and apologize to those that you have offended . You'd better not ask others questions about their age, sex and families. Unless you know the person very well, and you are both comfortable with sharing personal information, or don't ask such questions.",middle1470.txt
