3,D,"['a talk between two men', 'an interview', 'your attitude to your life', 'I wish you enough']",What's the most probable title of the passage?,"At an airport I overheard  a father and a daughter in their last moments together. They had announced her plane's departure. Standing near the door, he said to his daughter: ""I love you. I wish you enough.""
    ""Daddy, our life together has been more than enough. Your love is all I ever needed. I wish you enough too, Daddy."" They kissed goodbye and she left.
    He walked over toward the window where I was seated. I tried not to  _ his privacy, but he welcomed me in by asking:
""Did you ever say goodbye to someone knowing it would be forever?""
""Yes, I have,"" I replied.
""Forgive me for asking, but why is this a forever goodbye?"" I asked.
""I am old and she lives much too far away. I have challenges ahead and the reality is that her next trip back will be for my funeral. ""
""When you were saying goodbye I heard you say, 'I wish you, enough'. May I ask what that means?""
He began to smile. "" That's a wish that has been handed down from other generations. My parents used to say it to everyone."" He paused for a moment looking up as if trying to remember it in detail, and he smiled even more. ""When we said 'I wish you enough', we wanted the other person to have a life filled with enough good things to sustain them,"" he continued and then turning toward me he shared the following as if he were reciting it from memory. 
I wish you enough sun to keep your attitude bright. I wish you enough rain to appreciate the sun more. I wish you enough happiness to keep your spirit alive. I wish you enough pain so that the smallest joys in life appear much bigger. I wish you enough gain to satisfy your wanting. I wish you enough loss to appreciate all that you possess. I wish enough ""hellos"" to get you through the final ""goodbye"".",high22114.txt
