0,D,"['For one month', 'For two months.', 'For three months.', 'For four months.']",41. How long had Tim and Dom been at sea when their boat was hit by a fishing boat?,"Tim Welford, aged 33, and Dom Mee, aged 30, both from England, were keen on (=""like..."" very much) rowing boats. They made a plan to row across the Pacific Ocean from Japan to San Francisco. The name of their rowboat was ""Crackers"". It was about seven meters long.
They set out from Japan on May 17,2001. They had rowed nearly 5,500 miles when their boat was hit by a fishing ship on September 17,2001. Luckily they both escaped unharmed, but their boat was badly damaged and they had to abandon( ="" stop)their"" journey.
In a radio interview, Dom expressed his disappointment and explained how the accident took place.
""A fishing ship came towards us with nobody on the bridge and ran us down. It all happened so quickly. I managed to dive into the water. Tim felt it would be safer to stay on board. He was trapped inside as the boat was driven under the water. Finally some people appeared on the ship and saw me in the water. I shouted at them to stop the ship and to get Tim out. When the ship stopped, I eventually saw Tim, and I was very, very happy that we were still alive. We were very disappointed that we couldn't reach San Francisco. But we are alive. That above everything is the most important. """,high16062.txt
