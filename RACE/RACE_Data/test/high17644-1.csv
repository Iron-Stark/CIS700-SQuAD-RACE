Some PE classes feature in-line  skating, yoga, and even rock climbing. Experts have called those types of activities ""the new PE"".
Such activities are part of a larger effort to help kids develop lifelong fitness habits and to keep them from becoming overweight. Now, 9 million U.S. children and teens are overweight. Obesity   can lead to health problems such as diabetes and heart disease later in life.
""Our children and youth are becoming unhealthy and obese,"" says Johnson. ""Skateboarding is a great activity that keeps kids doing physical movement and gives them new skills and interest.""
Some schools don't allow skateboarding because they say it is dangerous. Tim, however, argues that regular practice eliminates a great deal of the danger. ""We teach students how to do it and how to do it safely,"" he says.
Some people say skateboarding teaches life lessons. ""Skateboarding teaches kids to believe that if they stick with  something they will finally succeed."" says education expert Richard Savor from College in Portland.
Skateboarding encourages kids not to give up in learning difficult skills. ""It's natural for kids to want to learn and get better at things,"" adds Tim. ""When it comes to skateboarding, they'll try a trick hundreds of times before they succeed."" The same effort could be made in schoolwork.
Eric Brown agrees that skateboarding requires kids to stop saying a task is too hard for them. ""A baby will attempt to walk 600 to 900 times before he or she is successful,"" says Eric, ""We tell students that they shouldn't say 'I can't do it' unless they've tried 600 to 900 times.",high17644.txt
