0,D,"['People who want to eat quietly in a nice restaurant.', 'People who want to enjoy home-made food', 'People who like traditional American food', 'People who are fond of Italian food']",Who would be most likely to go to eat at Frigo's?,"Hidden in a small street in the south end of Springfield, not far from buildings torn apart by the tornado  earlier this year, Frigo's is an Italian restaurant right in our own backyard.
Frigo's is not a tiny place. It provides different kinds of Italian food. There are refrigerator cases full of prepared foods and desserts, and shelves filled with olives and various pasta.
There's some traditional Italian music and the smell is of olive oil and garlic . Above the largest refrigerator case, there's a chalk board covered with desriptions of more Italian sandwiches than I could remember.
I stepped into Frigo's almost by accident when I had to stay in Springfield into the evening for an open house at the school where I work. Frigo's is the perfect place to find something quick to go. There are no tables, so all food is taken out. I also thought it would be a great place to pick up some already-prepared food to bring home for dinner.
I ordered the easiest meal possible: a chicken sandwich and a salad. It cost$4.75 for the sandwich. The salad was$4.99 and didn't have salad dressing on it. I must have missed the choice of salad dressing on the way out. The sandwich was great--great chicken, excellent tomato sauce and not too much cheese.
I wish I had tried one of the many other sandwiches which include Joe's Favorite ($5.25-$6.75) and the Dante (King) which is made of turkey breast, roasted red peppers, asiago cheese and choice of dressing.
I have a feeling that I'll be picking up dinner for me and the kids at Frigo's soon.",high98.txt
