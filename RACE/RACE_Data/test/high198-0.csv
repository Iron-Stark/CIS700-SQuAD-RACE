I was born disabled.A difficult birth, feet first, my head stuck.By my first birthday, I couldn't stand or walk.
When I was three, the doctor told dad I had cerebral palsy  .A loss of oxygen to my brain had destroyed brain signals to the right side of my body.
But no son of my dad' s was going to be disabled.Every morning before breakfast and every evening before bed, my dad placed me on the bedroom floor to exercise my right leg.The muscles were shrunk and twisted together.Back and forth up and down, my dad pushed and pulled the muscles into shape.
But my dad' s exercise of passion didn't stop there.For my 13th birthday, he threw me a special party.When everybody was gone, he brought me to open a large box, it was a-set of boxing gloves.We put them on.My dad kept on beating me mercilessly.Each time I tried to get up, leather kissed my nose, eyes and jaw.I ""begged him to stop. He said he beat me to get me ready for the tough world.
That same year, I was the only kid in my neighborhood that wasn't picked for Little League. Two weeks later.Dad started the Shedd Park Minor League, and every kid played.Dad coached us and made me a pitcher  .
The power of my dad' s love guaranteed I walked and more.In high school, I became a football star.
In 1997, a brain surgeon in San Jose told me I didn't t have cerebral palsy after all.He explained how and where the doctor' s forceps   at birth had damaged my brain.
My dad never knew the whole truth since he passed away years ago.But all that counts is the bottom line.After all his madness, on this Father' s Day, like every Father' s Day, I' m no longer disabled.",high198.txt
