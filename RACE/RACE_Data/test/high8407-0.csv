0,B,"['it may weigh as much as 3 pounds', 'it may be driven by plastic chips', 'it may be replaced by robots', 'it may play the music of the mind']","According to Bart, the brain may be the greatest wonder in the future because   _  .","Try imagining what the world will be like in the year 3000. Some serious thinkers are starting to imagine just that.
Bart: I don't know that present-day electronic chips are, but some sort of chips -- I'd guess maybe plastic. Our three-pound brain is definitely a wonder, perhaps the greatest wonder of natural biology. In this coming century, we'll be re-engineering the brain a piece at a time, first with implants  and finally engineering an complete replacement. There's no question that in the distant future we'll play the music of the mind on instruments different from the current ones. So, yes, chips are our destiny  .
Edward: In 3000 perhaps the biggest difference from today is that there will be no more men. Females can have female children, without any need for men. In about ten years, we'll find the cocktail that women can take to have female children. There'll be no need for men at all.
Greg: What is Heaven? Heaven's a place where you can create worlds at will, and the ideal Heaven is where you run the whole thing yourself. The current means of getting to Heaven involve various supernatural systems for which, at this point, there's no scientific evidence. So I think we can reduce Heaven to an engineering project which we're doing. The demand for Heaven is great--witness the desire of every human heart, from the people who built the ancient pyramids to modern society, to live beyond one's given time. Our plan is to change human consciousness from the brain to bits of information in a computer chip, or some other kind of computational medium, so that just by thinking we'll be able to create our own personal world. And I think the first stage of Heaven will be the feeling world, and beyond that I think we'd find a higher, more spiritual plane.",high8407.txt
