3,C,"['The situations on which parents embarrass their children.', 'Parents should be careful not to embarrass their children.', 'It is normal for teenagers to feel embarrassed with their parents sometimes.', 'The generation gap between children and parents is growing.']",What is the main idea of the passage?,"Do you feel embarrassed when your mum tries to use slang  or when she calls you by your childhood nickname in front of your friends?

Part of going through adolescence is a sudden feeling that we are wise and self-sufficient and we are embarrassed when treated like vulnerable babies. But we are bound to lose this discomfort when we reach our 20s. 
Gopnick reminds us of writer William Blake's comment: ''When I was 14, my dad seemed to be so silly that I wouldn't even walk down the street with him. By the time I was 21, I was amazed how much he'd learnt.'' 
In any case, dissatisfied parents might feel comforted in the thought that their grandchildren are likely to end up enjoying their company. Then the uncool   ones will be the grandchildren's parents!",high22963.txt
