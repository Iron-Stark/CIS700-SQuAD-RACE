2,D,"['was very sensitive to what others thought of her', 'was active but pessimistic about her misfortune', 'attached great importance to group honor', 'was positive about her life and achieved a lot']",It can be inferred from the passage that Jenny  _  .,"We found out that Jenny was suffering hearing loss when she was four and a half years old. Several operations and speech classes later, when she was seven, we found out that Jenny had Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis .
She could not put pressure on the heels of her feet, so she walked on tiptoe , and when the pain became unbearable, I carried her. Jenny was fortunate, though, because she did not suffer the deformities , often associated with JRA.
All through grade school, and on into high school, Jenny suffered, yet never complained. She took her medicine, and I would often wrap her feet in steaming towels, and hold her until the pain eased. But, as soon as she could stand the pain, Jenny, immediately, carried on, as though she were pain-free.
She wore a smile on her face, a song on her lips, and a love and acceptance of others. That was simply amazing. She ran, when she could run. She played when she could play, and she danced when she could dance. And, when she could do none of these things, she took her medicine, and she waited until she could.
Jenny, a beautiful girl with warm brown eyes, was never a cheerleader. She never competed in a sport. She joined the band. She won a place in the Govemor's School for the Arts; yet, no one in the Charleston, South Carolina School System knew what to do with Jenny. The perimeters were, simply, not in place to deal with a student, who was both active and disabled. Jenny continued to have one operation after another on her ears, all through school. Her hearing improved to 60%, and she taught herself to read lips.
At school she was popular, attending every football game to cheer the team on. She carried her pillow everywhere she went, so that she could reduce the pain when she sat down. Then came her senior year in high school. She liked school activities, especially sports. So she began to bombard the school football coach. Finally the coach gave in, with the warning,""If you miss ONE game, you're out!""So, Jenny became Manager of Garrett High School Football Team.
She carried big buckets of water to her teammates. She bandaged knees and ankles before every game. She gave inspiring talks and it turned out to be one of the best years for Garrett High School football Team in its history. When asked why he thought that the team was winning all their games, one team member Jack explained, ""Well, when you've been knocked down, and you can't seem to move, you look up and see Jenny Lewis, walking across the field, dragging her buckets and carrying her pillow. It makes anything the rest of us may suffer seem pretty unimportant.""
At the Senior Awards ceremony, Jenny received a number of scholarships to College of Charleston. Her favorite scholarship, however, was a small one from the Charleston Women's Club. The President of the Women's Club listed Jenny's achievements, starting with her grades, and ending with an excited,""...and the first girl to letter in football, in Garrett High School history!""",high17189.txt
