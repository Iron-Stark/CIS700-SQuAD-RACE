0,D,"['Anxious but perfect.', 'Afraid of the fall of the British Empire.', 'Terrifying but also attractive.', 'Powerful, old and ugly.']",What is the vampire like in Bram Stoker's book?,"Vampires  , creatures of myth, have been around in one form or another for centuries. Terrifying but also attractive, they are as popular in the early 21st century as ever, as the current popularity of Twilight series, and its hero Edward Cullen, show. Vampires first appeared in fiction in the 1700s; in 1895 Irish novelist Bram Stoker published Dracula, introducing the world's most famous vampire.
But just what is it about these drinkers of human blood that continues to fascinate us? Speaking to Eric Lewis of the Times and Transcript website, academic Deborah Wells said that vampires are ""culturally adaptive "". ""We create very different vampires to fit different times. Edward Cullen is not the same as Count Dracula,"" she said.
Different as they are, Wells believes vampires are ""the perfect containers into which we can pour our current cultural anxieties"". Bram Stoker's Dracula is powerful, yet old and physically ugly. Stoker's book dealt with fear of the fall of the British Empire, real fears in the day in which it was written.
According to the website Bookpages, today's vampires have all our cultural desires, money, power and sexual attraction. Represented by Cullen, they are noble, handsome young men whom women find irresistible . What's more, vampires challenge traditional ideas about death, science and parental authority . This may be why teenagers are drawn to vampire tales.
""In many ways, the vampire story shows up teenage concerns,"" said Wells. ""The emotional intensity   of the relationship with the vampire matches the intensity of how it feels to have your first real love affairs. Your first real love, it really feels like life and death.""",high23296.txt
