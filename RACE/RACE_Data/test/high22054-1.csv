1,A,"['teaches it on the Internet', 'attracts people to visit La Gomero Island', 'raises money to support students from La Gomero Island', 'translates stories about it into other languages.']","In order to protect Silbo Gomero, Busuu.com   _","The ancient whistled language of the small island of La Gomera, off the coast of Africa, is about to disappear because of new technology and globalization. Now, a web company has taken on the task of saving the language by marrying history with technology.
Silbo Gomero, a language used only on La Gomera Island, sounds to the untrained ear like few other known languages. The sounds that make up this language are made by whistling, rather than by speaking.
The language was brought to the island by African setters many centuries ago. To communicate among the  _ populated inland hills and valleys, shepherds   had to use the whistled language, which could be heard and understood over distances of up to eight kilometers, compared to about 200 meters for a spoken word.
With the development of new technologies like the cellphone, the number of Silbo Gomero whistlers has declined to around 1,000. Many of the older generation of islanders fear the language, which they consider to be a cultural symbol, may become extinct.
To save Silbo Gomero, Busuu.com, a website based in Madrid, has launched a movement to teach Internet users worldwide to communicate using the language's unique whistles. ""We really like the whole story of Silbo Gomero because it is really a fun language, "" said Bernard Niesner, the company's co-founder.
 Niesner says one of the founding principles of the website was to promote learning languages in danger of extinction. ""If Busuu.com really works out like we think, it would be an amazing tool for language learning all over the world,"" Niesner said. ""The name of our website itself comes from Busuu, a language that is spoken by only eight people.""",high22054.txt
