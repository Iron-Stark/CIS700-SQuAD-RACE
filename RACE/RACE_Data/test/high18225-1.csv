I've grouped the major contributors to Memletic State into three layers. These are the cell, physical and mental state layers. In summary, the elements that make up each of these layers are:
*         Cell State Layer: Water, Glucose, Oxygen, and Basic Nutrients. 
*         Physical State Layer: Health, Fitness, Relaxation, Environment, Sleep and Body Rhythms, and Supplements. 
*         Mental State Layer: Health, Fitness, Relaxation, Attention and Concentration, Positive Mental Attitude, and Goals.

These elements impact how well you breathe, circulate blood, fight off illness and more. The outer layer is the mental state layer. The elements of this layer are within our mind. Notice how cell state layer supports the physical state layer, and the physical state layer supports the next layer out, the mental state layer.",high18225.txt
