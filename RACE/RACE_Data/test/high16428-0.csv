0,D,"['They said something that hurt the fishermen.', ""They entered a pool which wasn't allowed to go into."", 'They attacked Japanese culture.', 'They tried to stop the fishermen from killing the dolphins.']",Why did the surfers get into trouble with the fishermen in Japan?,"Actress Hayden Panettiere recently got into trouble with Japanese fishermen as she tried to stop them from killing dolphins.
The 18-year-old star with some other surfers sailed out to reach the dolphins in order to stop them from being driven into a nearby pool and killed, but the six surfers, from Australia and the United States, were stopped by a fishing boat before they could reach them. The fishermen blocked their way with a boathook  . It was an ugly, unfriendly and life-threatening struggle before the surfers were forced to return to the beach. It is believed that the dolphins were later taken into a pool and killed.
Panettiere, who is a brave surfer and loyal animal protector, made up her mind to save the dolphins of Japan and said, ""It was really frightening. Some of us were hit by the boathook, but in the end all we were really worried about the dolphins. It was so sad. We were so close to them and they were jumping out of the water to see us."" Breaking down in tears, she added, ""One little baby dolphin stuck his head out and looked at me and the thought that it's no longer with us is really hard to take.""
The surfers left the country to avoid arrest   by the Japanese police. Panettiere is now back in Los Angeles.
More than 22,000 dolphins are killed by fishermen in Japan every year. Many Japanese believe dolphins should be treated like fish. They have been hunting dolphins for centuries and see any criticism   of this as an attack on their culture.",high16428.txt
