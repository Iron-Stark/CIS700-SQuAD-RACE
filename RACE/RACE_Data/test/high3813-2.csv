A Growing Problem
Going to school is difficult for more than 13 million children in India. They must go to work instead, or go hungry. That's why India began the Mid-Day Meal Scheme, the largest school-lunch program in the world. A free lunch encourages children to come to school and gives them the energy they need for learning. The program began in the 1960s.
The kitchen in Vrindaban is run by the Akshaya Patra Foundation. It is one of the lunch program's biggest partners. ""Just $11.50 can feed one child for an entire year,"" said Madhu Sridhar, president of the Akshaya Patra Foundation.
