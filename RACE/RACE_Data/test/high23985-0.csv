0,D,"['his concern for his own safety', 'his poor driving skill', 'the icy road', ""his concern for others' lives""]","According to the passage, Ronnie put the truck in the ditch because of   _  .","It was near dusk, and Kim Cooper and her husband, Steve, were trucking through northern Kentucky transportation auto parts from Louisville to Detroit for a goods company. ""Steve, wake up!"" she shouted. ""There's a truck on fire!""
Inside the burning truck, Ronnie Sanders, 38, was fighting for his life. He'd been running a heavy load of tractors and forklifts from Georgia to Indianapolis when a van in front of him stopped suddenly in traffic on the icy road. As Ronnie bore down, he could see children in the backseat. The truck's bulk would probably protect him from the worst of the impact, but the force of 23 tons would likely crush everyone inside the van.
""I figured instead of killing other people, I'd just put the truck in the ditch."" At the bottom, rocks cut a fuel tank, which caught fire. A tree branch destroyed the windshield and knocked Ronnie unconscious. He came to life a couple of minutes later to find the cabin flames and his legs on fire.
Steve dashed to Ronnie, who was hanging headfirst from the passenger door. Ronnie had used his pocket knife to cut himself free from the driver's side seat belt only to get his boot trapped in another one. Steve climbed into the burning cab to free him.
He tried three times to pull Ronnie out before finally freeing him. But Ronnie's legs were still burning, so Steve laid him on the ground, ripped off his own shirt, and beat the flames with it. He'd managed to drag him about 20 yards when one of the truck's 150 gallon fuel tanks exploded.
Both Steve and Ronnie paid a price for risking their lives for strangers. Ronnie spent two months in the hospital and received skin grafts  on both of his legs. Steve suffered smoke breathing and minor burns, and shrapnel from the fuel tank explosion broke a tooth.
In February, the Coopers received a Hero of the Highway award from the Open Road Foundation for rescuing an injured driver. Steve insists Ronnie is the real hero: ""If he hadn't gone into the ditch, he would have hit that van. It was his decision to drive off the road.""
""I feel pretty good about it,"" says Ronnie. ""A lot of people could have been hurt.""",high23985.txt
