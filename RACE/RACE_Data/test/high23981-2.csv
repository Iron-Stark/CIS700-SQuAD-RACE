It also feels good to give presents to others. So what's the best way to budget your money, shop wisely and spend smartly this holiday season? Time for kids asked for advice from Susan Beacham of Money Savvy Generation, a company that teaches money-management skills to kids.
"" My first tip is to make a list and check it twice,"" says Beacham. She suggests that kids talk with their families about whom to include in their gift giving and how much to spend. Start by writing down names, Beacham says. Then put a dollar amount next to each name and add it up. Do you have enough money? If not, make changes. And don't forget---- not everyone needs a store-bought gift. Beacham points out that some of the best presents are free. Add to your list the names of people you want to give gifts of time and talent.
Do the match
Take the list with you to the store and ""make sure that you do the math,"" says Beacham "" If you've spent $ 30 on someone you were going to spent $25 on, you're going to have to spend $5 less on somebody else."" The key to budgeting is staying within the boundaries you've set for yourself.
Gifts from the heart
The best gifts don't cost a thing. Here are some of Beacham's top gifts ideas.
*For parents, make coupons  that can be trade for your services, such as doing dishes.
*For grandma, write a note telling her how special she is to you.
*For a friend, create a work of art, like a poem, a drawing or a necklace.
*For teachers, bake a delicious cake.",high23981.txt
