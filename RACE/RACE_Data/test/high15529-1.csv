1,C,"['she wanted to ask him a question', 'she wanted to see his face', 'she was angry with him', 'he had been rude']",Rosemary made him look at her because    _   .,"A number of times Rosemary edged closer to Gordon , meaning to take his arm, but he edged away from her. She thought that she had offended him deeply, and that he was disappointed because she had pushed him away. She would have apologized if he had given her half a chance. But as a matter of fact, he was scarcely thinking of this any longer. It was the money business that was troubling him now. And the fact was that he would soon have to confess it. What nonsense it made of all he had said! Presently she stopped him, and swung him round to face her. ""Gordon, why won't you speak to me?"" she said. ""Are you still angry with me for what happened just now?""
""No, I was never angry with you. You're not to blame. Something else has been worrying me all the way along, I've only eight pence left. I had just enough money for today when we started out, but that dinner bill upset everything. Can you lend me some money?'
Rosemary was amazed. ""What does it matter if you've only eight pence left? How can you let yourself be worried by a thing like that? As though I objected to lending you money, aren't I always telling you that I want to pay for myself when we go out together?'
""Yes, and you know how I hate you paying.""
""Oh, how silly you are."" She said. ""Do you think there's anything to be ashamed of in having no money?""
Gordon's face went bright pink. ""Of course there is ! It's the only thing in the world there is to be ashamed of. I can't be a complete human being--I don't feel a human being -unless I've got money in my pocket.""",high15529.txt
