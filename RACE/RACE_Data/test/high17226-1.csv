1,D,"['where you can meet people all around the world', 'where you can buy what you want', 'where you can get free services', 'where you can meet people on the Internet']","According to the writer, your website is a place   _  .","In the 1960s, people asked about your astrological sign . In the 1990s, they wanted to know your website. These days, having a web address is almost as important as a street address. Your website is an electronic meeting place for your family, friends and potentially, millions of people around the world. Best of all, you may not have to spend a cent. The Web is filled with all kinds of free services and all it takes is some time and creativity.
       Think of your home page as the starting point of your website. Like the table of contents of a book or a magazine, the home page is the front door. Your site can have one or more pages, depending on how you design it.
       While web pages vary greatly in their design and content, most use a traditional magazine layout. At the top of the page is a banner  GRAPHIC. Next comes a greeting and a short description of the site. Pictures, texts, and links to other websites follow.
       Before you start building your site, do some planning. Think about whom the site is for and what you want to say. Next, gather up the material that you want to put on the site. Draw a rough layout on a sheet of paper.
       While there are no rules you have to follow, there are a few things to keep in mind:
       Start simply. If you are too ambitious at the beginning, you may never get the site off the ground. You can always add to your site.
Less is better. Most people don't like to read a lot of text online. Break it into small pieces.
       Smaller is better. Most people connect to the Internet with a modem. Since it can take a long time to download large image files, keep the file sizes small.
       Have the rights. Don't put any material on your site unless you are sure you can do it legally. Learn the Net's Copyright Article for more about this.
