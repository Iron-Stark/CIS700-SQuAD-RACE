      Death of a Salesman was created in 1949 by Arthur Miller, who  used it to reveal   the weakness of the ""American Dream"" .The main character, Willy Loman, believes wholeheartedly in American capitalism, and desires to ""succeed"" but his own greed  _ him in the end.Death of a Salesman's first performance was a huge hit on Broadway, where it shocked the American theatre world, and strengthened the 33-year-old Miller's status as a master of American theatre.The play won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, New York Drama Critics' Circle, and the Tony Award for Best Play.The New York Times praised Death of a Salesman as a milestone of 20th century theatre.In 1999, Death of a Salesman received another Tony Award for Best Revival, and the then 83-year-old Miller was given the National Medal of Arts.
