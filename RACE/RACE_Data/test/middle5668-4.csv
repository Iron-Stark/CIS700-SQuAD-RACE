When the king learned this, he got angry and sent his men to cat ch Effendi at once.
When Effendi was in front of the King, the king shouted angrily, ""Effendi, since   you know when my Minister would die, you must know the date of your own death. Say it out, or you will die today.""Effendi looked at the king for a while, he answered, ""But how can I know? I'll die two days earlier than you.""Because the king was afraid if he killed Effendi, he himself would die after that. He thought he must keep Effendi alive as long as he could, so he let Effendi go.",middle5668.txt
