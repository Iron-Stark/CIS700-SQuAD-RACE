0,D,"['should report the battle above', 'should be paid more attention to', 'should collect more Chingliah phrases', 'should be in duty to teach normal English']",We can infer that the English language versions of newspapers   _  .,"Beijing has started a battle to get rid of ""Chinglish"" (Chinese English).The ""Language Mandarins"" of Beijing have decided that Chinglish is a disease for China's modernizing claim and must be _ before the city hosts the Olympic Games in 2008.
A road sign on the Avenue of Eternal Peace (Chang'an Street) ,for example, advises: ""To Take Notice of Safe; The Slippery Are Very Crafty"", a warning that the sidewalk was slippery .Another sign in a Beijing park reads: ""Little grass is smiling slightly, please walk on sidewalk.""
Li Honghai, the city official in charge of the battle, said,"" Linguistic perfection   is becoming increasingly important with the rise in the number of the foreigners flowing into the city.""
However, not everyone shares the disdain   of the Beijing government for the mixed language.""The choice of words is pretty much.One can either choose the verbs, adverbs, nouns or whatever one likes,"" explained one Hong Kong linguist on an Internet website.
So many examples exist that several Internet sites have been set up to collect Chinglish phrases.Many come from English instructions on packages such as a candle marked with ""Keep this candle out of children"" and a model boat--curiously named Posh Sailboat--which means, ""Please don't place it in dusty play.""
If the battle against Chinglish is successful, Chinese will also turn their attention to the English-language versions of newspapers, which play an even more important role in teaching right English.",high15256.txt
