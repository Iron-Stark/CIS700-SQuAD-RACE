We have come to know of an unfortunate incident you had with our customer service department and we would like to deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused to you by the customer service manager's behavior. We have noted down your complaint (number 797329SA) and would like to let you know that strict action will be taken against the employee. He is a new employee with little experience and so his attitude towards his job was over enthusiastic and he lacked proper judgment.
We are by no means excusing his behavior but I would like to request you not to take any legal action against the company as we are very sorry for what happened. To express our appreciation, please accept the offer of free servicing of all products of our company that you own for up to three years. We will also make sure that the faulty  air conditioner is replaced by us at no extra cost so that you do not face any further problem.
Once again, we are very sorry for the incident. Please contact us if you have any questions.
                                                           Yours sincerely,
                                                              Nate Borges
Dear sir,
I should like to apologize for the inconvenience caused to you due to poor Internet connectivity. I understand that you require the Internet all through the day as all your business deals are done online and since last week your work has been affected a great deal.
We are continually working towards providing the best possible services to our customers. You have been using our service for the last three years and are aware of the excellent quality of service offered by us. However, this time due to some major technical fault the Internet service was interrupted and our customers in your part of the city are facing our poor Internet connectivity problems.
The issue is likely to be solved within the next two days; kindly bear with us until then. Once again I apologize for the poor service.
                                                           Yours faithfully,
                                                              David Johns",high16900.txt
