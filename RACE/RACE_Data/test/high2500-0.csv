0,D,"['Order no salad in a restaurant.', 'Take in no salt for several days.', 'Stop cooking their favorite meals.', 'Eat less takeaways.']",What would the writer probably suggest black people do?,"Now I know that we black people are much more likely to have high blood pressure and diabetes  than white people. And _ often lead to heart attacks and other untreated diseases. For example, black people are three to four times more likely than white people to have high blood pressure and twice as likely as the white population to die of a stroke .
New research has found out the surprisingly high levels of salt in many of black people's favorite meals. I stopped putting extra salt in my food at the table long ago and I try to cut down on the salt I use in cooking. The recommended daily level of salt for adults is 6 grams. It is easy to see that if you avoid processed  foods and use salt in your cooking within the limit, you won't exceed the daily level.
The research showed how much salt there is in some foods that we buy from restaurants and takeaways. An average salad with rice and peas has 6.2 grams of salt. This is more salt than you are supposed to eat for the whole day.
A researcher talked about the importance of home cooking rather than take-outs. At home, he pointed out, not only can you hold control of the salt shaker, but also you can create tasty food which is low on salt. The researcher later provided curry goat and rice and peas. They were low on salt, but completely delicious.
I do not suppose Jamaicans are going to stop buying takeaways soon. But if you suffer from high blood pressure, it is probably better not to buy them often.",high2500.txt
