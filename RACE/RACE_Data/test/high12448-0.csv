The majority of students who use Facebook every day are doing badly compared with those who don't. About 83% of British 16 to 24-year-old people are using social networking site such as Facebook and MySpace, to keep in touch with friends and organize their social activities.
""Our study shows people who spend more time on Facebook spend less time studying,"" said Aryn Karpinski, a researcher. ""Every generation has its distractions , but I think Facebook is a unique phenomenon."" Karpinski and a colleague questioned 219 US undergraduates and graduates about their study and general Internet use, as well as their specific use of Facebook. They found 65% of Facebook users accessed their account daily, checking it several times to see if they had received new messages. The amount of time spent on Facebook at each log-in  varied from just a few minutes to more than an hour.
Some UK students have already realized the potential danger. Daisy Jones, 21, an undergraduate, realized the time she was spending on Facebook was threatening her grades, urging her to deactivate  her account, ""I was in the library and tried to write a 2,000-word essay when I realized my Facebook habit had got out of hand,"" she said. ""I couldn't resist going online, when thinking about it. Before you know it , a couple of minutes have turned into a couple of hours and you haven't written a word.""
Jones is among the few to have realized the risks. 79% of the users, however, believed the time they spent on the site had no impact on their work. The CEO of Facebook said, ""There is also academic research that shows the benefits of services like Facebook. It's in the hands of students to decide how to spend their time.""",high12448.txt
