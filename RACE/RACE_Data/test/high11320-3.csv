People are actually starting to see me as an artist.""Ten-year-old Akheylah Hunter didn't play an instrument when she became a club member last year. Now,she plays piano and sings with the band.

Since the Music Clubhouse opened three years ago,it's served almost 500 kids.Aggeler says performing in front of different audiences helps the young musicians build self-esteem.Coming to the club to prepare for those performances helps them learn how to deal with their personal problems and concerns.
""I can see what it does for them and it just develops confidence,""he explains.""It's also an escape from the big problems we have in the neighborhood. So whether they feel embarrassed about a zit on their face,or they feel embarrassed because they're not as tall as somebody,they can rap about it and let it out a little bit.""
To expand the club and help more kids learn music,Aggeler sought the support of the community. The Berklee College of Music and local music stores have provided free equipment. The club has also gotten support from the Music and Youth Initiative,a nonprofit that develops after school music education programs in underserved communities in Massachusetts. All these have made it possible to provide kids who may not have the means to get private music lessons the opportunity to still learn music and get all the benefits that music education brings.""",high11320.txt
