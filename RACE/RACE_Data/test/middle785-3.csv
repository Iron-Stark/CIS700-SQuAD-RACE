She thinks her present must be in it. She opens it, and there is a piece of paper in it. She reads it, ""Dear Judy, I'm your present. My first letter is in the word 'bag', but not in 'age'. My second letter is in 'like', but not in 'lake'. My third letter is in ""know"", but not in 'now'. And you can find my last letter in both 'desk' and 'get'. What am I?"" Judy thinks for a while and says, ""Aha, I know. But where is it?"" Her father tells her it is in her study.
