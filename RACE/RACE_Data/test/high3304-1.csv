1,C,"['Because the ""no touch, no comfort"" policy toward children was quite right.', ""Because parents were advised not to respond to babies' crying."", ""Because Harlow's work changed people's former belief in child care."", 'Because mothers were not allowed to have their newborns next to them in the hospital.']",Why was Harlow's monkey work important?,"For some reason, it takes constant reminders that weprimates need nurturing.
In a recent study of 46 babychimpanzee orphans, Kim Bard of the University of Portsmouth in England and her colleagues demonstrated that primate babies that have tight relationships with mother figures do much better oncognitive tests than babies who receive only food, shelter, and friendship with peers. But this is not breaking mews. In fact, it's old news.
In the 1950s, Harry Harlow conducted a series of experiments with baby monkeys that showed, without doubt, that lack of love and comfort makes for a crazy monkey.
Harlow constructed a cage that included a wire monkey ""mother"" topped with a plastic face. In this wire he fixed Mom with a milk bottle. The cage also held another wire mother covered with terry cloth. The baby monkeys spent all their time with the cloth mother and only went to the wire mother to feed, demonstrating that a soft touch beat something to eat any day.
Harlow's monkey work was important because, at the time, child care ""experts"" and everybody's grandmother had a ""no touch, no comfort"" policy toward children. They advised parents not to respond to crying babies, felt babies should sleep alone to grow up independent, and for God's sake put those kids down. But Harlow's work changed all that. Mothers were soon permitted to have their newborns next to them in the hospital.
The current chimp research based on Harlow's work shows that mother love not only makes for a psychologically well-adjusted child, but also makes for a smart kid. Bard and her colleagues evaluated the abilities of the chimps when they were 12 months old with standard human tests for children of that age, tests that ask little kids to imitate some action.
The highly raised chimps did better than the ones that were not loved, and what do you know, the well-raised chimps did even better than human kids on this small IQ test.
So we hear it once again. We are primates, social animals which need care and love. We need to be held and talked to and made to feel that at least one person wants to be with us all the time. And if we get that kind of connection, we are sure to be fine, even better than fine.",high3304.txt
