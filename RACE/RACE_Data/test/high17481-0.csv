0,A,"['His wise decisions helped him achieve goals.', 'He knew miners there were poor.', 'He succeeded quite by accident.', 'His second wife helped him a lot.']","According to the passage, why was Tabor able to achieve great success in Leadville?","When people talk about Golden Age in Leadville, Horace Austin Warner Tabor and his second wife, Elizabeth McCourt must be included. Their story is becoming one of the legends of the Old West. H.A.W.Tabor was a school teacher in Vermont. With his first wife and two children he left Vermont in 1855 to settle in Kansas. Perhaps he was attracted by rumors of fortunes to be made in Colorado mines. A few years later he moved west to the small Colorado mining camp known as California Gulch, which he later renamed Leadville when he became its leading citizen. ""Great deposits of lead are sure to be found here.""he said.
As it turned out, it was silver, not lead, that was to make Leadville's fortune and wealth. Tabor knew little about mining himself, so he opened a general store selling everything from boots to salt, flour, and tobacco. He often ""grubstook"" miners, in other words, to supply them with food and supplies, or""grub"", while they looked for more. In return he would get a share in the mine if one was discovered. He did this for several years,but nobody he helped ever found anything of value.
Finally one day in the year 1878, so the story goes, two miners came               in               and asked for ""grub"".Tabor had decided to quit supplying it because he had lost too much money that way. They were persistent, however, and Tabor was too busy to argue with them, "" Oh help yourself. One more time won't make any difference,"" He said and went on selling shoes and hats to other customers. The two miners took $17 worth of supplies, in return for which they gave Tabor a one-third interest in their findings. They picked a barren place on the mountain side and began to dig. After nine days they struck a rich amount of silver. Tabor bought the shares of the other two men, and so the mine belonged to him alone. This mine, known as the ""Pittsburgh Mine,""made $300 000 for Tabor in return for his $17 investment.               
Later Tabor bought the Matchless Mine on another barren hillside just outside the town for $117 000. This turned out to be even more successful than the Pittsburgh, earning $35 000 worth of silver per day at one time. Leadville grew. Tabor became its first mayor.",high17481.txt
