1,B,"['74.8 seconds.', '24.03 seconds.', '20.1 seconds.', '19 seconds.']",What was Clarke's best record in pumpkin-carving competitions?,"It takes a lot of skills and hard work to set a world record in pumpkin-carving . Steve Clarke, a sixth-grade teacher from Pennsylvania, is a famous carver . Clarke has set many world records for carving pumpkins quickly. When he competes, he must cut our two eyes, two eyebrows, a nose, a mouth, and two ears as fast as possible. But Clarke knows something else about pumpkin-carving. It's easier to get a record than to keep it.
He took the t _ in 2000 when he carved a pumpkin face in 74.8 seconds. That time was 19 seconds faster than what Jerry had set. From then on, Clarke broke his own records five times. In 2006, he set his best time in Florida. His winning time was 24.03 seconds!
The only problem is that someone finally beat that mark. On October 7, 2010, David set the new record with 20.1 seconds. Clarke was not able to break that record this year, but he has planned to break the record. After Halloween, he will go to local pumpkin farms to practise designs and new skills.
Clarke is popular because of his super pumpkin-carving skills. In 1999, he carved more than 30 pumpkins at the Halloween party for then vice-president Al Gore.",middle6480.txt
