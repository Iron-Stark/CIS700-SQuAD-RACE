1,D,"['Wedding vows are usually composed by the minister.', 'The young couple face the audience throughout the wedding.', 'The couple composes their own vows to avoid nervousness.', 'The minister is the chief witness at the wedding ceremony']",What can be inferred from the passage?,"Although most weddings follow long-held traditions, there's still room for American individualism. For example, the usual place for a wedding is in a church. But some people get married outdoors in a scenic spot. A few even have the ceremony while skydiving or riding on horseback! The couple may invite hundreds of people or just a few close friends. They choose their own style of colors, decorations and music during the ceremony. But some things rarely change. The bride usually wears a beautiful long white wedding dress. She traditionally wears ""something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue."" The groom wears a formal suit.
Several close friends participate in the ceremony as attendants, including the best man and the maid of honor.
As the ceremony begins, the groom and his attendants stand with the minister, facing the audience. Music signals the entrance of the bride's attendants, followed by the beautiful bride. Nervously, the young couple repeats their vows  . Traditionally, they promise to love each other ""for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health."" But sometimes the couple has composed  their own vows. They give each other a gold ring to symbolize their marriage commitment. Finally the minister announces the big moment, "" I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss your bride!""
At the wedding reception, the bride and groom greet their guests. Then they cut the wedding cake and feed each other a bite. Guests talk with each other while enjoying the cake, drinks and other treats. When the reception is over, the newlyweds run to their ""decorated"" car and speed off. Many couples take a honeymoon, a one- to two-week vacation trip, to celebrate their new marriage.",high10037.txt
