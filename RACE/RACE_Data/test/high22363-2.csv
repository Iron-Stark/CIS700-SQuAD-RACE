2,A,"['a young woman called Yang Qunhui has started her restroom-ad business.', 'restroom ads have advantages including low price and easy words.', 'many people think restroom ads are effective because they can kill the time.', 'people tend to remember lots of things while sitting or standing in the loo.']",This passage mainly tells us that   _  .,"Yang Qunhui, 28, a graduate of Chengdu University of Information Technology, Sichuan Province, gave up her job with a monthly salary of 20,000 yuan ($3,014) at a famous company, but has started her own restroom-ad business with five other graduates, becoming a ""restroom queen.""
The company, opened in May, is now the only one of its kind in Chengdu.
It has two goals: to find suitable restrooms to place ads and to find clients  who are willing to put their ads in them.
""We are now trying to find restrooms to place the ads. A larger area means more ad sources,"" said Yang.
Yang got the idea to run the company one year ago when she looked for toilet repairing information on the Internet but finally noticed companies in Beijing and Shanghai doing restroom ads.
""It's so interesting,"" she said. ""Everyone has their dream. Mine is to start my own business and do something I like.""
After some research, Yang found the advantages of restroom ads. They are low-cost, making it easier to find clients. ""Most private companies are middle or small-sized ones. Cheap ads are an good choice.""
Another advantage, she said, is that people tend to remember words and messages they've seen while sitting or standing in the loo.
Yang said sitting on a toilet, one usually feels bored and even an old newspaper helps kill the time. 
""Most people think an ad is effective as long as it is read, however, the ad works only when it is remembered by readers,"" she said.",high22363.txt
