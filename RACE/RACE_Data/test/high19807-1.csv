1,C,"['flying like an eagle', 'trying something special', 'having their own dreams', 'learning unusual techniques']","According to the author,   makes people unique.","Flying
Ever since I was old enough to dream,I have imagined myself soaring with the eagles.My love of flying has shaped the way I live and the person I have become.Two years ago,that passion rocketed to new heights when I had the opportunity to visit Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona.For a whole week I lived in a college dorm,roomed with a total stranger and---best of all---I flew!
My group took part in activities ranging from learning about the history of aviation   to flying in state-of-the-art pilot training simulators  .At least once a day,I devoted myself to learning one of the world's best training aircrafts,the Cessna 182.Not only did I receive thorough ground instruction,but I also got to fly.In total,I flew five hours to receive my private pilot's license.
In that one joyous and oh-so-short week,my passion for aviation grew even stronger.Now,
whenever I see a plane flying overhead,I feel a sense of pride thinking I've done that.
During my time in and above the Arizona desert,I learned not only about the mechanics and
techniques of aviation,but also about myself and how I see the world.As I floated in that seemingly endless sea of air,I became aware of the variety and complexity of the humanity below.On the ribbons of roadways,each tiny car carried people with hopes and dreams.I wondered if any of those people had ever wished to fly like an eagle.Then I realized that each must have his or her own dreams and ambitions.That's what makes us unique.We try to respond to something special inside us.I also realized that I was especially fortunate to be making my own dream come true.
Everywhere I go,I hear,""Do what makes you happy and you will be happy.""It sounds like
standard advice,but I've really thought about it and taken it to heart.I couldn't care less about how much money I make or what benefits I receive.I know that I am already in hot pursuit  of my dreams.And,even if they change,even if they finally don't involve aviation,I'll always aim to fly with the eagles.",high19807.txt
