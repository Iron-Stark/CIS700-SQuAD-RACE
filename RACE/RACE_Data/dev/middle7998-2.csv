They disagree with each other and begin to argue. Sometimes, they even stop talking to each other. What can be done to help the two friends make up? Finding a good friend who knows both of them very well to be a peacemaker is a good way. Maybe one day you will be a peacemaker for your good friends. Here are some useful communication strategies for you to use.
State your feelings clearly but don't criticize them. Begin with ""I feel"" instead of ""You always..."".
Don't stop or finish the other person's sentences.
Listen carefully to what the other person is saying. Try to see the other person's side of the disagreement.
Look the other person in the eyes when you are talking.
Ask questions to make sure that you understand them.
Repeat the other person's ideas as you understand them.
Never put anyone down. Saying things like ""You're stupid"" makes communication difficult.
Try to find a solution that makes the two friends happy. Never decide who is right and who is wrong. Instead, help them to find their own ""win-win"" solution. A ""win-win"" solution allows each of them to feel good. In this way, their friendship can be continued.",middle7998.txt
