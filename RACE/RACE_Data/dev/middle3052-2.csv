2,A,"['keeping calm is very important during the earthquake', 'we can hide under the tree during the earthquake', ""we don't have to care about aftershocks"", 'we should keep shouting for help if we are trapped']",. From the passage we know that   _  .,"Many earthquakes happen without warning, so it is important to know what to do when it happens. Here are some tips on how to stay safe in earthquakes.
*Keep a cool head. Worry won't help you. Think about what you should do. The first several seconds are important.
*If you are indoors, stay inside and _ and cover. Hide under a desk or table, or stand in a corner. Cover your head and neck with your arms. Stay away from windows and anything that could fall on you.
*If you are in a crowded  hall or shop, don't rush for the door. You will find too many people trying to get out at the same time. Instead, lower  yourself close to the ground and cover your head and neck with your hands and arms.
*If you are outdoors, try to get into an open area away from buildings, trees or street lights.
*If you are trapped in a place, you may make noises by knocking at the rocks. But don't shout all the time. You could be without help for up to 72 hours. Try to find some water and food.
*Stay in your seat if in a cinema or a theatre. Get below the level  of the back of the seat. Cover your head and neck with your arms.
*Stay in a safe area until you are sure it's OK to leave. Some aftershocks  may follow. They are as dangerous as the earthquake.",middle3052.txt
