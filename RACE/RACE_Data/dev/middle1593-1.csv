1,C,"['smaller than', 'the same as', 'three times as large as', 'a little larger than']",The usual size of cars today are  _  that of future cars.,"A kind of little cars may some day take the place of today's cars. If everyone drives such cars in the future,there will be less pollution from the cars. There will also be more space for parking cars in cities,and the streets will be less crowded. Three such cars can park in the space now needed for one car of the usual size.
The little cars will cost much less to own and to drive. Driving will be safer,too,as these little cars can go only 65 kilometers an hour. The cars of the future will be fine for getting around a city,but they will not be useful for long trips. Little cars will go 450 kilometers before needing to stop for more gas .
If big cars are still used along with the small ones,two sets of roads will be needed in the future. Some roads will be used for the big,quick cars and other roads will be needed for the slower,smaller ones.",middle1593.txt
