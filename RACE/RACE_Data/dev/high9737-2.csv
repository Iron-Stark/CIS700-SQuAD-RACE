2,A,"['Not all buyers know the materials they are buying.', 'A fur coat with a high price often carries a false label.', 'A label only says what material the product is made of .', 'A T-shirt seldom carries a label.']",Which of the following is true?,"When you buy a T-shirt, or a fur coat in a store , it often carries a label  telling who made it or from what store it was bought. Indeed, some labels show the dress is famous and it is very expensive, so buyers who deal with the cheapest products would be pleased to do away with labels entirely.
However, there is another label more important than the one showing from which store the dress was bought. When a person buys a fur coat, or a jacket , from a store , a label telling what the product is made of should be carried to it.
This label is required by law. Besides telling what the product on show is made of , the label should be in clear English and be where one can find it easily. The information on the label must be the truth.
The reason for this label is that most buyers today aren't expert enough to know exactly what kind of fur or material they are buying. The buyer must believe in the store that sells the products or in what the labels say.",high9737.txt
