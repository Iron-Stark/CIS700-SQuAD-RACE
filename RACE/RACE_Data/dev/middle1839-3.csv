3,D,"['Sunny', 'Cloudy', 'Windy', 'Rainy']",How was the weather?,"We have a terrible school trip last weekend. Some students were late. Then we waited half an hour for the school bus, but it didn't arrive. Finally, our teacher took us to take the subway. It took us about an hour. After we got off the subway, we walked and got lost. When we finally arrived at the zoo, we were tired and hungry. We wanted to see dolphins, but there weren't any. There were some really smart seals, but we didn't see the show because we arrived too late. We left our camera at school, so we didn't take any photos. Then it started to rain, and no one had an umbrella. So we went for lunch. My friends had some ice cream. But I didn't have any, because I don't like it. We didn't see many animals because of the rain. Finally we went back to school. We were wet, tired and stressed out . I didn't enjoy my school trip at all.",middle1839.txt
