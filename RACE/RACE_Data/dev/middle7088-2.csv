2,D,"['Type O', 'Type A', 'Type B', 'Type AB']","If a person is both open and shy,noisy and quiet at the same time,he or she might be with   _   blood.","Is human blood all the same? ""Yes."" You may say, ""It's all red.""
Well, it's not as simple as you might think.
Blood is made up of different parts,such as red blood cells ,white blood cells and platelets .
Two chemical molecules on the red blood cells make people's blood different. Scientists mark one molecule ""A"" and the other molecules ""B"". According to which and how many molecules are on the red cell, scientists divide blood into four types: A, B, AB and O.
Scientists have been wondering if there are some links between people's blood types and their personalities, but they don't know for sure yet.
But some say that people with the same blood type may have things in common.
People with type A: They look peaceful from the outside. But they ask too much of themselves so that they may be very nervous inside. They get happy or sad easily. Sometimes they are shy but always very careful. They can easily win people's trust.
People with type B: They have strong minds. Once they start a task,they don't give up easily. They'll try their best to finish it and do it well. Type B people always try to make themselves different from others. They want to do things in their own way.
People with type AB: They are maybe the strangest among all blood types. They can be both open and shy,noisy and quiet at the same time. They are responsible and always ready to help others.
People with type O: They are open and good at making friends. They always start tasks but don't always finish them. They have lots of new ideas and love to be the center of attention. They always strongly believe in themselves.",middle7088.txt
