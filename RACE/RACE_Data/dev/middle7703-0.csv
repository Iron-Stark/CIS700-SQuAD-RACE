you can book a homestay on the Internet before you go abroad. It is easy for you to pick out a host family that you want to live with from all over the world. So what is homestay? And what makes it so popular nowadays?
Homestay means living with a foreign family or ""host family"" as we stay abroad. It is usually called a home away home. There are three ways of doing it:
Choose to learn English in a language school near your homestay where you
live ;
Have your English classes in the house with a member of family who is a qualified    teacher;
Don't have any classes at all when you visit a foreign country-a popular
choice if you want to be a tourist for example.
Even in the busy summer period the organization that provides the homestays will always try to place you with the most suitable  host family to meet your needs. With the help of the organizations, you don't worry about where you live, your interests, your language level, eating habits, medical care and anything else you may have during the homestay.
Though the price of homestay is,mainly depended on your needs, high-quality homestay accommodation can be relatively economical . And if you want your homestay in or near the city center, you may pay for an extra amount of money. Even if you stay further out. you can expect your journey into the center not to Go beyond 30 minutes.
Not only does homestay accommodation represent  value for money,it also gives you an excellent opportunity to practice the foreign language with your host family. This is a very important extra for students who like to speak as much language as possible. But if you plan to learn English. Why not have your English classes in your host family? There's no better way to learn languages than this because it makes learning and accommodation together as well as the cultural experience!",middle7703.txt
