There is a new _ law in New Jersey starting this school year.
New Jersey's law says bullying is not allowed for any reason. All public school workers, from teachers to headmasters, must be trained in how to prevent bullying. Schools must report any bullying at once, and they will be graded on how well they deal with the problem. New Jersey is one of 47 states with anti-bullying laws for schools. Only Michigan, Montana and South Dakota do not have such a law.
There are many kinds of bullying. It may include laughing at others, calling others names and leaving someone out. It can also be physical. The behavior happens over and over again, and can take place anywhere, from the playground to the Internet. It's reported that nearly half of all kids will experience bullying in school, and at least 10 percent are bullied regularly.
Each year in October, many people begin to pay attention to bullying and try to do something to stop it. Many schools hold anti-bullying programs.
Will stronger anti-bullying laws change the behavior forever? Ken Trump, president of the National School Safety and Security Services, says no. ""State anti-bullying laws do not provide more money, or other support,"" he said. Some people note that they had strict anti-bullying policies in place long before the law passed. ""The law will not change what we do, because we already take this matter very seriously,"" explains Bruce Winkelstein, the headmaster of Brookside School in New Jersey.
