How can I finish so much homework every evening? What should I do if I'm not interested in my classes ? Who will teach us this term ? Maybe you have such questions in your mind before school starts.
Well, I want to give you some good advice on these problems.
First, keep calm.Don't worry about all the question you have. Put your heart into learning,and you can find something you are interested in.Do it actively.
Second, try your best to finish your homework quickly.Don't spend a lot of time on it.Do more reading or writing in English.Think about the problems you have and solve them at once.Don't stay up late,or you can't study well the next day.
Third, think of something instead of copying or repeating.If you can remember the words in your way,you can tell your teachers you don't like the way of copying them again and again.Be sure you can pass the test.I think your teachers will agree with you.And they can give you something interesting to do.
School is really a good place for you to learn.Believe in your teachers and yourself.You are the best one and you can do everything well.",middle1689.txt
