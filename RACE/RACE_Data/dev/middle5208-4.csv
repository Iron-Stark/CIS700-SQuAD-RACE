4,C,"['Motor Neural Disease', 'Life Is Fair', 'Professor Stephen Hawking', 'A Lazy Boy']",What would be the best title for this passage?   _  .,"Stephen Hawkins was born in Oxford, England on 8thJanuary, 1942. He went to school in St. Albans--a small city near London. Although he did well, he was never top of his class. After leaving school, Hawking went first to Oxford University where he studied physics, then he went to Cambridge University where he studied cosmology. As he himself admits, he didn't work hard. He was a very lazy student, and did very little work. However, he still got good marks.
It was at the age of 20 that Hawking first noticed something was wrong with him. He started to bump  into things. When he visited his family at Christmas time, his mother was so worried that she made him see a doctor. Hawking was sent to hospital for tests. Finally, the result came back. Doctors said they had no way to help him. He would die before he was 23.
At first, Hawking became very sad, after a while, though, he began to see his life in a different way. As he later wrote, ""Before my illness was diagnosed , I had been very bored with life. There had not seemed to be anything worth doing. But shortly after I came out of hospital, I suddenly realized that there were a lot of worthwhile things I could do."" Hawking married, found a job at Cambridge University, and had three children. He also went on to do some of the most important scientific research.
Today, Hawking still works at Cambridge University as a professor. He strongly believes that his story shows that nobody, however bad their situation is, should lose hope. ""Life is not fair,"" he once said. ""You just have to do the best you can in your own situation.""",middle5208.txt
