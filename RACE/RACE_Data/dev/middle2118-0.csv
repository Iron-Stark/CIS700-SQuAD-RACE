0,B,"['At the booking office.', 'In the Economy cabin.', 'In the Club cabin.', 'In the First Class cabin.']",Where did this story happen?,"On a British Airways flight from Johannesburg, a middle-aged ,rich white South American lady found herself sitting next to a black man. She called the cabin stewardess over to complain about her seating.
""What seems to be the problem, Madam?"" asked the stewardess.
""Can't you see?"" she said. ""You've sat me next to a black man. I can't possibly sit next to this kind of human. Find me another seat!""
""Please calm down, Madam,"" the stewardess replied. ""The flight is very full today, but I'll tell you what I'll do---IWill go and check to see if we have any free seats in Club or First Class.""
The lady had an unfriendly look at the outraged black man beside her.
A few minutes later the stewardess returned and said to the lady with a self -satisfied smile, ""I'm sorry, Madam, this Economy is full, and Club is also full. However, we do have one seat in First Class.""
The lady could not help looking at the people around her. But before she had a chance to get up or make any answer, the stewardess continued , "" We seldom make this kind of upgrade ,however, and I had to report it to the captain .When the captain heard this,he said that it was not proper to make someone sit next to such an obnoxious person."" Having said that, the stewardess turned to the black man sitting next to the lady, and said, ""So if you'd like to get your things, sir, I have a seat ready for you...""
At this time, the people around stood up and clapped their hands. The black man walked up to the front of the plane.
That was an unforgettable flight for me, for I was the black man who had never flown First Class before.",middle2118.txt
