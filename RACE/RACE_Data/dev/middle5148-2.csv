People are different, but they all have the same needs. Needs are things people must have to live. Our bodies need food and water. We also need air to breathe. We need a place to live to keep us safe. We need clothes to keep us warm. If we did not have these things, we could not survive .
Needs may be different for people who live in different areas. If you live where it is cold, you may need special clothes to keep you warm. If you live where it is hot, you may need more water.
People have found new ways to meet their needs. Farmers grow food that people eat. They used to plant seeds by hand. They used to pick plants by hand. Now they have machines that do this work.
* Our Wants
Wants are things people would like to have but do not need to live. Suppose you hope to get a football for your birthday. A football is a want. You can live without it.
Sometimes we might want something so much that it feels like a need. We have to make choices, though. If you need a new coat for winter, you might not be able to get the football you want. We must choose what we need over what we want.
Sometimes we must make choices between things we want. Suppose you want to go to a birthday party for your uncle. That day, a friend asks you to go to a movie. The movie is at the same time as the party.
If you choose to go to the party, then what would you give up? What would you give up if you went to the movie?",middle5148.txt
