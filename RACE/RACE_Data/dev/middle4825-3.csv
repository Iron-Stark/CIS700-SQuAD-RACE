Dear Editor,
Can't your newspaper do something about the habit if hitchhiking ?
On a recent car trip Icounted at least 50 people standing beside the road, asking for rides. Many of them were young girls.
Don't they understand how dangerous it is to get into a car driven by a stranger? What do they know about the driver's character or ability to drive? Nothing.
Many of the young hitchhikers probably come from good families. Don't their parents teach them anything about the world? I always teach my children not to talk to strangers. I never allow them to accept rides from people they didn't know.
Isn't there enough crime   today without asking for trouble by hitchhiking?
