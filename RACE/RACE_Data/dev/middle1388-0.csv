0,D,"['having no idea what the other students were talking about', 'getting lost on his way to his favorite cinema', 'having trouble finding the right words when speaking', 'not knowing who he was']",Andrew's strange behavior  including all the following except  _  .,"Andrew Engel was puzzled. He was sitting in class, but had no idea what the other students were talking about. He had done his homework, paid attention to lectures, and taken notes, but nothing was familiar. ""Everyone is so much cleverer than I am,"" he thought. It was a strange feeling, as he was always a good student in high school.
He felt even more puzzled a few days later. He got lost on his way to his favorite cinema. What's worse, he began having trouble finding the right words when speaking. He asked, ""What's for dinner, Mom?"" after he had just eaten. Poor Andrew, he was only 15!

Doctors removed the tumor, but Andrew's memory was still poor. He was told he would probably never go back to school. Andrew was eager to enter a university, but it seemed that his dream wouldn't come true.

Six months later, Andrew found a job.",middle1388.txt
