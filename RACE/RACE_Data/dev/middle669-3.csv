3,A,"['If you care about others on your road of life, then you are having your life itself.', 'If you care about others on your road of life, then you are missing your life itself.', ""If you meet an old man with a rose in the street, then you'll have interest in your life."", 'If you have interest in others, then you are having your life itself.']",What is the main idea of this passage?,"When I was a kid, my dad worked in a shop in the center of our town. Sometimes, I went to the shop with him and I made a little pocket money by buying things for his workmates. But I never paid attention to all the things and people around me.
One day, as my dad and I were driving to the shop, I looked out of the window of the car and I saw an old man standing at the street corner. There was a rose in his hand, he was smelling the rose. For some reason, our eyes met and we looked at each other for about twenty seconds. There was nothing unusual about this man but the meet was unusual to me. Up to that moment in my life, I had given no thought to anyone on the street, in shops or anywhere else. I had no interest out of my family.
But I was interested in that old man. For the first time I had interest in a stranger. What kind of life had he lived? Where had he been in his time?
Once a great man encouraged us to ""stop and smell the rose"". Now I want to tell these words to you. Stop what you are busy with and try to fully understand things and people in your eyesight. If you don't care about others on your road of life, then you are missing your life itself.",middle669.txt
