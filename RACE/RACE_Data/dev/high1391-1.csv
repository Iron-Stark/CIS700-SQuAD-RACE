1,C,"['unless men try to run away', 'if they are too old and too weak', 'if they are able to get enough food', 'however men act towards them']",Lions and tigers will not kill or eat men   _   .,"Some people think that all wild animals are very dangerous. Actually, very few of them will _ a man if he leaves them alone. If you met a lion or an elephant, suppose, you would run away, but even a lion will keep away from a man unless it is very hungry. Lions and tigers only kill and eat men when they have grown too old and too weak to catch their usual food, such as deer and other small animals. If you saw a wild elephant, perhaps you would be frightened. Elephants usually run away at once unless you attack them. Some animals get very frightened if they only smell a man; some take no notice at all but quietly walk in another direction. Wild animals only attack hunters when they are afraid that the hunters mean to harm their young ones, or then the hunters shoot at them and make them angry.",high1391.txt
