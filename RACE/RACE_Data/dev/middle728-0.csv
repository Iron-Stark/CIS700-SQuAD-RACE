A genius needs to learn and think. Reading is a good idea, but it is not enough. Einstein's advice is to use your brain more. Here are some tips:
l Ask. When you look at new things, ask why they are new or different. Ask more questions. Ask yourself and others. Keep thinking until you find the answers.
l Draw. Einstein thought in pictures. Sometimes, it helps to draw problems and ideas.
l Read. Try to read new things. Read books from different parts of the library. After you read, think about the ideas you have learned. Are they different from what you thought?
l Relax. Many ideas come when you are relaxed. Take some time to relax yourself in the ways like taking a walk in a park, going to a concert or a museum.
l Write. Keep a diary. Write down your questions and ideas. Write down new ideas after you read.
l Share. Einstein used to talk to his friends and explain his ideas. Sometimes, a friend can help you find the answer to a problem.
l Be brave. Do not let other people say your ideas are silly. Explain yourself. Let other people explain why they think you are wrong. Then decide.",middle728.txt
