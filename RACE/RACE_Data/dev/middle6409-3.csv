3,C,"['Orange', 'White', 'Green', 'Black']",Which color is NOT mentioned  in the passage?,"The word for this summer's new clothes is HAPPY. Colors are bright  and sunny, with lots of yellow, red, and orange. You can also find some great bright patterns , such as striped  and checked  pants. In the clothes shops this summer, you'll see a lot of beautiful floral  dresses. Long skirts are popular again, and so are jeans and shorts for holidays and sports. White is the new color for shoes and bags. So put away all of your boring   black and dark colors-it's time for summer!",middle6409.txt
