0,C,"['Because it can provide useful information.', 'Because the owner of the network is polite.', 'Because it is free.', 'Because it is safe.']",Why do people like to go log on to a public WiFi network?,"All over the world the need for more laptops and computers increases each year. Networks have been part of our life. Probably everyone with a portable device (} has once logged on to a public WiFi network without paying for it, while they are having a coffee, on a train, in a shopping mall or at a hotel. However, is this kind of public WiFi network safe?
Some networks are better protected than others because encryption  methods are used. Therefore, they are safer than others. But a survey in 2015 showed that more than 950 million records were not protected, including addresses, emails, birth dales, phone numbers, passwords and so on. These open WiFi networks are really not safe, because it is very easy for hackers   to break into the operating system and get people's private information.
Most smartphones and laptops, by themselves, search and connect to WiFi networks. They usually prefer a network with a connection that has been used before. Hackers' devices are able to record these searches and look like the trusted WiFi networks. When these smartphones and laptops log on to the networks which are not real, hackers can easily steal their private information.
So next time, when we want to use our laptops or our smartphones in public places which offer free WiFi networks,please think it twice or take safe measures before using them.",middle7351.txt
