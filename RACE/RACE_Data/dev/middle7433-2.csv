2,D,"['9 a.m.', '3 a.m.', '11 a.m.', '1 p.m.']",Denial's sister isn't sleeping at   _  .,"Some students will have no time to relax, while others have no plan for the coming February.
Denial, a high school student, who is going to take part in the college entrance examination, said he had to go to the capital city of Guangdong Province every weekend. He has found a new professor who can help him prepare for the exam. His family is not rich, but his parents offer him 800 yuan for each lesson and 200 yuan to pay for the bus ticket. He said he would try his best to pass the exam next year. Therefore, he has to practice playing the piano 6 hours a day before every lesson. He said he even thought sleeping was a waste of time. How hard-working he is!
However, not every student has a perfect plan like Denial. His younger sister doesn't get up until noon. She said holiday was boring because she couldn't play with her classmates. That's why she keeps sleeping for a long time to avoid being bored. What a special reason, isn't it?
Do you like their holiday plans? If not, why not listen to Aunt Li for advice?
Dear students,
How can you have a wonderful holiday? Both relaxing and studying are very important for you. I suggest you make good use of your time every day and make a plan before the holiday begins. Two hours' study is not a long time, right? Don't spend too much time playing computer games or watching TV. It's bad for your eyes and neck. If your parents are free at the weekend, going out for a picnic sounds great.
Have you made up your mind, students?",middle7433.txt
