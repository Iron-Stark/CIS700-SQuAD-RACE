2,B,"['show us new equipment', 'tell us what kind of work he does', 'Tell us how he became good at watching water birds', 'give us advice on how to work in the dark']",The writer writes the passage mainly to   _  .,"I work at a university in the USA. There, my team and I are trying to learn more about the American black duck,a kind of water bird.And now we are using an exciting piece of equipment called a ""night vision scope"".By using it,we can see the ducks in the dark.
We're worried about black ducks mainly because their numbers are falling _ And we don't know whether there's enough food on the east coast for these birds.There's lots of information about their daytime activities,but nothing about what they do at night,because we don't have the equipment. But this new""scope""will make really clear pictures, even on moonless nights,so we will be able to find out more about the ducks.
It is very hard work.There are four of us,and we each work six hours every day.We study ducks in different places,and I sometimes have to take a boat to where I need to work.the weather is not helpful because most of the time it's wet.Oh,and it's so quiet that sometimes I need coffee to stop me from falling asleep.
