2,C,"['the frogs got to the big city', ""it wasn't worth going any farther"", ""the frogs didn't see the big city at all"", 'the big city was just like their village']",We can infer that   _   according to the passage.,"Two frogs had lived in a village all their lives. They thought they would like to go and see the big city that was about ten miles away.
They talked about it for a long time, and at last they set off to see the big city.
It was a hot day, and they soon began to feel tired. They had only gone a little way when one said to the other, ""We must be nearly there. Can you see the city?""
""No,"" said the other frog, ""but if I climb on your back I might be able to see _ .""
So he climbed up on the back of the other frog to see the city.
Now when the frog put up his head, his eyes could only see what was behind, and not what was in front. So he saw the village they had just left.
""Can you see the city?"" asked the frog who was below.
""Yes,"" answered the frog who had climbed up. ""I can see it. It looks just like our village.""
Then the frogs thought that it was not worthwhile going any farther. They went back and told the frogs around the village that they had seen the city, and it was just like theirs.",middle5064.txt
