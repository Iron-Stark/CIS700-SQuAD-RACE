2,B,"['everybody would go camping in the class', 'Jess had no friends in the class', 'everybody liked Jess in his class', 'Jess joined in many out-of-school activities']",From the story we know   _  .,"Jess really felt very happy. When he arrived at his seat in the classroom that morning, he found an invitation on his desk. It was from some of his classmates asking him to join their camping trip. This was the first time he was asked to join in an out-of-school activity. Why were they asking him now? Nobody seemed to like him. In fact, he had been so lonely   that he ate a lot to make himself feel less lonely. As a result, he had put on a lot of weight, and this gave the children something more to make fun of him.
Cindy, who was standing near Jess when he read the invitation, went out quickly to tell the others that the trick had worked. Everyone was happy that Jess thought that was true. But there was no camping trip. The whole thing was made up.
At first, Cindy thought it was fun. But later, when Jess told her that he was going to buy a sleeping bag with his pocket money, Cindy had a second idea. She knew that Jess's family had little money, and she hated to see him spend his pocket money on something he would never use. Cindy also hated to tell Jess the truth  . Her close friends would be unhappy with her.
What could she do now?",middle2414.txt
