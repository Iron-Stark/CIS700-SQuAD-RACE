0,A,"['how the deaf communicate with others', 'teaching the deaf to speak with their mouths', ""learning how to spell words with one's hands"", 'how sign languages came into being']",The passage is mainly about   _   .,"For many years, no one could communicate with people who had been born without learning. These deaf people were not able to use a spoken language.
But, beginning in the 1700s, the deaf were taught a special language. Using this language, they could share thoughts and ideas with others. The language they used was a language without sound. It was a sign language.
How did this sign language work?  The deaf were taught to make certain movements with their hands, faces and bodies. These movements stood for things and ideas. A man might move his finger across his lips. This meant, ""You are not telling the truth."" He might tap his chin (, )with three fingers. This meant ""my uncle"".
The deaf were also taught to use a finger alphabet . They used their fingers to make letters of the alphabet. In this way, they spelled out words. Some deaf people could spell out words at a speed of 130 words per minute.
Sign language and finger spelling are not used as much as they once could. Today, the deaf are taught to understand others by watching their lips. They are also taught how to speak.",high7705.txt
