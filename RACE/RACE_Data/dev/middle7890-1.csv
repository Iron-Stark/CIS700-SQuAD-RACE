1,A,"['Seasons and Moods', 'The influence of Genes', 'Moods and Health', 'The Importance of Birthplaces']",What's the best title of this passage?,"Are you happy most of the time? Or do you easily get angry sometimes? Everyone has a different temperament . It is usually believed that both genes  and environment may affect people's temperaments in different ways. Scientists have found that the season of the birth also plays a role.
Scientists from Budapest, Hungary, studied 400 university students. In the study, the students need to finish a questionnaire . The purpose of it was to find out which of four kinds of temperaments they most had. From the questionnaire, scientists found that the students always answered something like ""My mood often changes for no reason.""and ""I love to deal with new projects, even if it is risky.""These answers were then matched with their birthdays.
They discovered that people born in summer easily change between sad and happy moods compared to people born in winter. Those who always feel positive are mostly born in spring and summer.
The study also found that those born in autumn less probably had a mood of _ which may easily drive them to cry, while those in winter were not easier to be angry.
Scientists said that this was probably because the seasons had an influence on certain chemicals in the human body. And the chemicals are important to control people's moods even in adult life.
""It seems that when you are born may increase or decrease your chance of developing certain mood disorders  ,"" lead scientist Xenia Gonda told the Telegraph.
