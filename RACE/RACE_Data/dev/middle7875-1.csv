I had many friends who were boys. I thought of them as my best friends-but only friend. I never guessed my friendship with boys would become a problem.
Then, two months later, my friends told me that some teachers and girls said I was hanging out with boys all day long to get attention from them. A few months after that, the class teacher James asked the class to choose some students to join the Student Union. I thought I could win for I was doing well at school. I came first in the English and Math exams. A week later, the list came out and it didn't include me. James came to me and said, ""Don't be sad. I know you're excellent!
