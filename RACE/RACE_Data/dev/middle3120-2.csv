2,C,"['He left it in the countryside.', 'He gave it to his brother.', 'He took it home after the holiday.', 'He played with it and gave it back to the man at last.']",How did the writer deal with the puppy?,"I was not having a happy holiday. My family had decided to go back to the countryside in New Hampshire, US, again. But I found it boring. What made the holiday even worse was that I had to sleep in the same bed as my brother. But I was wrong. This trip was the best holiday I have ever had. During the holiday, I met a very special friend.
While I was walking in the countryside, I saw a man carrying a small brown bag. Wearing white clothes, the man looked like a ghost. As he looked at me, I felt frightened. I wanted to run away when the man spoke to me. ""Hello. Beautiful day, isn't it?"" he said. The man talked a lot. I wasn't listening very carefully because I was looking at his little bag. I wanted to see what was inside it!
He saw me looking at the bag and he asked me if I would like to see. Out came a lively, beautiful puppy. The brown puppy was small and only about two months old. The man then asked me, ""Would you like to keep this puppy?"" I had always wanted a puppy and now I had the chance. I thanked him, took the puppy and ran home. For the rest of that summer, I played with him all the time. And after the trip, I took him home. The puppy is now loved by all my family. He is a friend to both my brother and me, a warm little ball of happiness in our lives.
I've always wanted to thank the man because he changed my life. His gift has given me years of pleasure. And I never have boring family holidays anymore.",middle3120.txt
