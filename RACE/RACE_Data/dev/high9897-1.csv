A typical  Chinese Internet user is a young male who prefers instant messaging to e-mail, seldom makes online purchases  and favors news, music and games sites. According to a study, about two-thirds of survey participants use the Internet for news -- often entertainment-related -- or for online games. About half download music and movies.
They also tend to prefer instant messaging to e-mail, and they are depending on the Internet more frequently than before to communicate with others who have the same professions, hobbies and political interests. Online purchases still remain unpopular in China. Three-quarters of users surveyed have never bought anything over the Internet, and only 10 percent make purchases even once a month. Among those who do buy online, most pay for entertainment while others buy phone cards, or computer hardware or software.
""Many people don't trust the quality of goods bought online,"" Guo said Wednesday. ""If they buy it in a store and don't like it, they can easily bring it back.""
The survey was done in five major cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Changsha. Results do not necessarily project countrywide because Internet use in rural areas is lower than in cities. Guo describes the typical netizen in the five cities surveyed as young, male, richer and more highly educated. Males make up two-thirds of the Internet community, and more than 80 percent of users are under. Among people ages 25 to 29, 60 percent to 80 percent go online.
