2,B,"['He buys chocolate at school.', 'He gets chocolate from Sam.', 'He takes chocolate to school.', 'He gets chocolate from the cook.']",How does Tony get chocolate?,"My name is Tony, 13 years old from Los Angeles. I often eat my lunch at school. My mother is a nurse. She thinks most of the foods the students eat at school are healthy. The cooks  make different food and I can eat different things every day. I choose my favorite things. Today, I have some noodles, an apple, a cookie and a glass of milk. Milk isn't my favorite drink. Juice is my favorite, but they haven't got any juice today. I always have a cookie. It isn't healthy food, but it is my favorite part of my school meal. Apples aren't my favorite fruit, but they haven't got any oranges. Sometimes I give my apple to my friend Sam. Sam gives me some chocolate for the apple.
My mother makes sure I can eat a healthy dinner. She never gives me hamburgers, cola, candy, ice cream and too much meat. She thinks eating a lot of fruit, vegetables, some noodles, rice, fish, cheese and milk is good for me.",middle6565.txt
