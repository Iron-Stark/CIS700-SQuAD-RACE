2,C,"['It is wrong to cut down trees.', 'Hard work is the only key to success.', ""It's important to take time to sharpen our skills."", ""It's a waste of time to sharpen the axe.""]",What can we learn from the story?,"John was a very strong man. Once he got a job of cutting wood in a forest. His boss gave him an axe and showed him the area where he should work.
The first day, John cut down 18 trees. ""Good,"" the boss said, ""keep it up!"" John was encouraged by the words of the boss and tried harder the next day, but he could only cut down 15 trees. The third day he tried even harder, but he could only cut down 10 trees. Day after day he was cutting down fewer and fewer trees.
""I must be losing my strength,"" John thought. He went to the boss and said that he could not understand what was going on. ""When was the last time you had sharpened your axe?"" the boss asked. ""Sharpened? I had no time to sharpen my axe. I have been very busy trying to cut more treesl"" said John.
The moral of this story: While John was working hard, he didn't think about how to do his job better. Our lives are like that. We sometimes get so busy that we don't take time to sharpen our skills. Many of us never learn new skills. We think that whatever we have learned is enough. However, in some ways, sharpening our skills from time to time is the key to success.",middle2663.txt
