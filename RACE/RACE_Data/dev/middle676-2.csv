2,B,"['They are made into stamps', 'They are made into chips.', 'They are called e-textbooks', 'They put the books into e-schoolbags.']",How can e-schoolbags have all the things for study?,"Is your schoolbag too heavy to carry? The e-schoolbag will help you. It is said that e-schoolbags are going to be brought into use in Chinese middle schools soon.
Heavy schoolbags have been a serious problem for a long time. But the e-schoolbag will work it out. An e-schoolbag is much lighter than a usual schoolbag. Perhaps, the e-schoolbag should be called an e-textbook. It is as small as a usual book, but it can still have all the things for study, such as a textbook, an exercise book and so on. They can be made into chips  like stamps. The students can read the text page by page on the screen, take notes, or even send e-mails to their teachers. They only need to put the right chip into the e-schoolbag and then the students can use it.
Some people say that e-textbooks can be easily broken, while others say it is not good to student's eyes. But only time will tell.",middle676.txt
