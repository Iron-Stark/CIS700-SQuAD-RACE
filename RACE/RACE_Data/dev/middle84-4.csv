4,D,"['The hosts like the people who sit closer to them.', 'The hosts like the people who ask them time, price, age, etc.', 'The husband and the wife usually sit together.', 'You can call your host the next day or write a letter of thanks after that']",Which of the following is true?,"Some British and American people like to invite friends for a meal at home. You should not be upset if your English friends don't invite you home. It doesn't mean they don't like you. Dinner parties usually start between 7 and 8 p.m. and end at about 11. Ask your hosts what time you should arrive. It's polite to bring flowers, chocolates or a bottle of wine as a gift. Usually the evening starts with drinks and snacks . If you want to be extra polite, say how much you like the room, or the pictures on the wall. But remember-it's not polite to ask how much things cost. In many families, the husband sits at one of the table and the wife sits at the other end. They eat with their guests. You'll probably start the meal with soup or something small, then you'll have meat or fish with vegetables, and then dessert , followed by coffee. It's polite to finish everything on your plate and to take more if you want it. Did you enjoy the evening? Call your hosts the next day, or write them a short ""thank you"" letter. British and American people like to say ""thank you, thank, thank you"" all the time!",middle84.txt
