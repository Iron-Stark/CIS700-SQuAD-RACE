As we climbed down a small hill toward the water, my boyfriend John started to shout, and then jumped into the water. Peter and Mary quickly followed but I was too far away to jump. I was trapped .
I heard a low hum  , the group of bees looked like a heavy smoke. As _ got closer, I knew it was in fact a lot of bees flying towards me.
All I could do was to cover my face with my hands. Crazily, I thought that if I sat still   , the bees would think I was just another rock.
After a few seconds, I knew my plan didn't work. The bees attacked   me. I could hear my friends shouting at me to get down to the pool fast.
But it wasn't so easy. The only way I could get away was to use my hands to climb down the rocks. However, I didn't want to do that at first because my face would be unprotected . The noise of bees made me worried, but I could do nothing.
I rushed down the rocks and jumped into the pool. I was just so happy to be free from the pain.
But we still weren't out of danger. Every time we tried to climb out of the pool, the bees flew back over our heads. We spent the next three hours in the water, putting our heads under the water from time to time to avoid  the bees till they finally lost interest.",middle6382.txt
