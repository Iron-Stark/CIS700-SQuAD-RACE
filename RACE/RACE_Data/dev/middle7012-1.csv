1,B,"['DVD', 'WTO', 'GDP', 'VCD']",Which of the following is an abbreviation of an organization?,"Starting from this month, you won't be hearing the word ""NBA"" on sports programs on CCTV. Instead, sport hosts will give the full Chinese name when they refer to the NBA - National Basketball Association. You also won't hear any other English abbreviations on CCTV's Chinese programs, such as GDP (gross domestic product) or WTO (World Trade Organization). You will hear their Chinese translations.
CCTV received a notice from the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, telling it to avoid using English-language abbreviations in their reports to protect the ""purity"" of the Chinese language. A few other TV stations also received the notice.
Fu Zhenguo, an editor of People's Daily, is one of the people who proposed the change. ""Using English in a Chinese-speaking environment is against Chinese law,"" he said. ""Using English on Chinese TV programs is unfair to people who don't understand English. It will have a bad language influence on kids and teenagers.""
But some experts have a different opinion. Liu Yaoying, a professor at the Communications University of China, said the move shows cultural conservatism . ""If Western countries can accept some Chinglish words, why can't the Chinese language be mixed with English?"" Liu said.
A lot of people have criticized the move, saying that it will cause problems for them.
""I understand what CD, VCD and DVD mean when I hear them. But I won't know what the TV programs are talking about if I hear those products' full Chinese names,"" a person wrote in a BBS post. Following the same post, another person wrote jokingly: ""I'm not listening to my MP3 now. I'm listening to my Moving Picture Experts Group-1 Audio Layer 3.
Some people also question why CCTV is keeping its logo, since it is also an English abbreviation.",middle7012.txt
