1,D,"['Mondays', 'Tuesdays', 'Fridays', 'Sundays']",School students do chores on  _  .,"In western countries,many children do chores to get pocket money.They usually start to do this at the age of 10.School students have to do homework and study for tests.They don't have a lot of free time at the weekday.They often do chores at the weekend.Young kids only do easy chores.So they don't get much money.But that's all right.Many of them only want to buy candy.And candy is cheap!They help wash up after dinner,and feed the family cat or dog.
When they get older,kids want to buy more expensive things.Then they have to work harder!They often wash the family car,cut the grass,walk the dog or cook dinner.
Some jobs are a good way for kids to learn new things.For example,they can learn to use a lawnmower or how to cook.Of course,their parents help them at first.",middle5396.txt
