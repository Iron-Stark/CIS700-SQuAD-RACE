0,D,"['She is a teacher in a Thai school.', 'She is studying in a school in the north of Thailand.', 'She is a student from Thailand.', 'She is enjoying her stay in Thailand.']",Which of the following sentences about Mandy is true?,"Dear Liz,
My stay in Thailand has certainly been the experience of my life. Life is busy and exciting.
Bangkok is just like any other big city with a population   of 10 million and heavy traffic.
I'm very lucky because my host family is in a nice quiet area outside the city. There are Mr and Mrs Phairat, their son Sanan, who is 18, the daughter Chinda, who is 16, and Grandpa and Grandma.
I go to an international school with Sanan and Chinda. The school teaches about 70 percent in English, and 30 percent in Thai. I've learned some spoken language, but Thai writing is very difficult. The cooking lesson is my favourite. I'm learning all about Thai food and culture. People don't use chopsticks   here, but spoons and forks.
Last weekend we drove to Pattaya Beach near Bangkok. I thought it was great, but Sanan and Chinda said that next month they were taking me to Phuket Island, where the beaches are even more beautiful. The month after next, we're going to travel to Mr Phairat's hometown in the north of Thailand. The Phairats own land there, and they have two elephants. I'm going to ride those elephants and even wash them.
I'm amazed by everything in this country, especially by the elephants. Elephants are an important part of Thai culture and way of life. They have been a traditional _ of Thailand for many years.
I'll tell you all about my Thai boxing   lessons next time I write.
Love,
Mandy",middle4864.txt
