2,C,"['Old John smoked before', 'Old John smoked less than  before', ""Old John didn't smoke before"", ""Old John didn't smoke a cigar a day""]",Which one is true?,"Old John went to see a doctor. The doctor examined and said, "" Medicine can't help you. You must have a good rest. Go to a quiet place for a month, go to bed early, drink some milk, walk a lot and smoke one cigar   a day.""
""Thank you very much,"" said old John, "" I will do everything you say.""
A month later old John came to the doctor again. "" Well, I'm glad to see you. You look much younger."" Said the doctor.
""Oh , doctor,"" said old John, ""I feel quite well now. I had a good rest. I went to bed early, I drank a lot of milk, and I walks a lot. Your advice certainly helped me. But you asked me to smoke one cigar a day, and the one cigar a day nearly killed   me at first. It's no joke to start smoking at my age.",middle1187.txt
