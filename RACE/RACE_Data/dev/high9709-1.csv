1,B,"['Low income.', 'The debt.', 'Not having a good college degree.', 'Not having job opportunities.']",What's the biggest problem in Phil Grech's life?,"They should be Britain's gilded   youth, enjoying opportunities to study, travel and start exciting careers in a way older generations could only dream about. But instead they are the ""Ipod"" generation --""Insecure, Pressured, Over-taxed and Debt-ridden""--according to a study by a group of experts who provide advice and ideas on social issues.
""We thought that each generation would be better off than its predecessors  ,"" said Professor Nick Bosanquet of Imperial College London, one of its authors.

Many choose the jobs which offer a good amount of money after they retire. Others have to take any job that is available to try to pay off their debts.
""I borrowed a lot of money from the bank to pay for my education at university, which is the biggest chain around my neck now,"" said Phil Grech, 22, from Cumbria, who has a degree in maths from the University of Reading. ""I'm only doing a temporary job at the moment to pay the mounting bills. I haven't really thought about the long term. Many people think that when you leave university you can get a good job, but it's no longer like that.""
While older generations enjoyed higher education funded by taxpayers, young people today face university tuition fees and a decreasing ""return"" in the salary advantage they will get from their degrees.",high9709.txt
