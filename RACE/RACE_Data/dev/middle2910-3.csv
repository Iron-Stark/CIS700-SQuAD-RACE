Jin Xi, 16, from Harbin, Heilongjiang:
I really enjoy science. I visit many science exhibitions. I am interested in UFOs, too. I'm crazy about making model planes, although I'm not very good at it because I don't really have enough scientific knowledge. I'll be learning more science in senior high school. In a word, sometime in the future I'm going to build an excellent model plane!

I hope I can be taller in senior high school. I'm only 155cm. Many people grow faster in senior and I hope I will, too. I want to be 162cm. But I'm not sure about that, since most girls in my family don't grow taller than 160cm. I hope I'm different.
Zhang Fang, 15, from Hebi, Henan:
I expect that I'll make more friends in senior high school. I study in a middle school in the country. Most of my classmates live nearby. In senior high school, I'll meet different people from different areas. I hope I can learn new things from them.
