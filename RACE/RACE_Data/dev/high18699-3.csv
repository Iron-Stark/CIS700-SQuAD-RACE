3,C,"[""Parents play an important part in their children's growth."", 'The less you use your mind,the duller you may become.', 'Intelligence is obviously the result of where you were born.', 'What makes a person bright or stupid is still under discussion.']",Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?,"What makes one person more intelligent than another?What makes one person a genius,like the brilliant Albert Einstein,and another person a fool?Are people born intelligent or stupid,or is intelligence the result of where and how you live?These are very old questions but the answers to them are still not clear.
We know,however,that just being born with a good mind is not enough.In some ways,the mind is like a leg or an arm muscle.It needs exercise.Mental exercise is particularly important for young children.Many child psychologists think that parents should play with their children more often and give them problems to think about.The children are then more likely to grow up bright and intelligent.If,on the other hand,children are left alone a great deal with nothing to do,they are more likely to become dull and unintelligent.
Parents should also be careful with what they say to young children.According to some psychologists,if parents are always telling a child that he or she is a fool or an idiot,then the child is more likely to keep doing silly and foolish things.So it is probably better for parents to say very positive things to their children,such as""That was a very clever thing you did""or""You are such a smart child"".",high18699.txt
