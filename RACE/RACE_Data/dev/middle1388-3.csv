3,B,"['A man with an amazing brain', 'An unusual story of memory lost and found', 'How to improve your memory', 'Never lose your memory']",Which of the following is the best title of the article?,"Andrew Engel was puzzled. He was sitting in class, but had no idea what the other students were talking about. He had done his homework, paid attention to lectures, and taken notes, but nothing was familiar. ""Everyone is so much cleverer than I am,"" he thought. It was a strange feeling, as he was always a good student in high school.
He felt even more puzzled a few days later. He got lost on his way to his favorite cinema. What's worse, he began having trouble finding the right words when speaking. He asked, ""What's for dinner, Mom?"" after he had just eaten. Poor Andrew, he was only 15!
His parents were worried and took Andrew to see a doctor. A brain scan  made it clear: Andrew had a malignant brain tumor  . It was pressing on the part of the brain that makes new memory. He should be operated on as soon as possible. Andrew was _ !
Doctors removed the tumor, but Andrew's memory was still poor. He was told he would probably never go back to school. Andrew was eager to enter a university, but it seemed that his dream wouldn't come true.
""Even though they told me this, I knew I wanted to go back to school,"" Andrew said. ""I wanted to get my memory back.""
Andrew began by auditing  an English class at a nearby school. In class, he took notes carefully and read his notes several times a day, then typed them again and again. He studied twelve hours a day, seven days a week. He worked ten times harder than other students. In 2007, at age 29, he graduated from a local university. Six months later, Andrew found a job.",middle1388.txt
