2,C,"['To light on some candles.', 'To find some old clothes.', 'To try on a poor robe.', 'To clean some dirty rags.']",What did Chajam ask the well-dressed man to do in the dusty room?,"Omar Chajam is a wise old man who lives in a small town. One day when he was walking down the street, he met a man who was always jealous   of him. The man came up and began saying something bad to Chajam,""You are a drinker! You are a thief! You are an idiot!""
Chajam didn't care. He just smiled and walked on.
Another man dressed very well saw this. He didn't understand and asked Chajam,""How can you bear such offences  ? Don't you feel hurt?""
Chajam smiled again and said,""Come with me. I'll show you something.""
The man followed Chajam to a dusty   room. Chajam lighted the candles and began searching through a pile of old clothes. Then he found a completely worthless robe  . He threw it to the man and said,""Try it, it will suit you.""
The man took the robe and looked at it. It was so old that it even had some holes in it.
""What are these dirty rags   for?""asked the man angrily.""I am well dressed. You must be crazy!""He threw the robe back.
""You see,""Chajam said,""you didn't want to try on the rags. Similarly, I did not want to try those dirty words that man threw at me. To get angry by offences means to try on rags someone throw us. Now you see?""",middle4576.txt
