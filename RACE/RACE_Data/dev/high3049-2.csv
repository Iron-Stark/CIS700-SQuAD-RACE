2,A,"['Connecting Clothes with High Technology', 'New Ways to Discover Illnesses Early', 'How to Use a Computer', 'Smart Clothes and Exercise']",What is the best title for the passage?,"If you get a cellphone call, your sleeve  will soon be able to answer it. If you want to know how far you've run, your trousers will be able to tell you. Can't decide what to wear? Wish your clothes were smart enough to decide for you? A new computer science technology may be able to help your clothing to do just that.
Mark Jones, a computer scientist, says, ""We view electronic textiles   as, sort of, where computing meets the fabric  .""
This high-tech _ is bringing up the wearable computers, like trousers that can interpret movement and let a computer know your every move.
A loom   helps make the wires and fabric together. Then special equipment in the fabric can measure the speed. Signals are then sent from the trousers to a computer to show the process.
Tom Martin also says, ""E-textiles are a way for us to build wearable computers that look like normal clothing and can fit in fully with the environment.""
Researchers also hope wearable computers will help save lives. ""We will be able to tell what activity a person is doing. That sort of information is highly valuable when we're trying to monitor someone with a long-term illness such as heart disease,"" Jones says. Monitoring your every step is something that clever clothing can do a little easier. Researchers plan on developing more smart clothes to integrate computers into shirts, hats and gloves.",high3049.txt
