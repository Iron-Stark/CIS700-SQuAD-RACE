He was living in a village. His mother died a long time ago. His aged father, Ken, lived with him. Ken could not even walk well. He was so weak. It was because Jack did not give him enough food. He only gave his father a small bowl made from earth. Even a little rice in the bowl appeared to be much.
Jack had a son. His name is Mike. He was a very good boy. He loved his grandfather. He had great respect for the old man. He did not like his father's _ to his grandfather.
One day Ken was eating his food out of the earthen  bowl. The bowl fell down and broke into pieces. The food also fell on the floor. Jack saw the broken bowl. He was very angry with his father. The old man felt bad about what happened. He was sorry for his mistake.
Mike saw this. He did not like what his father did, but he was afraid to speak against his father. The next day, Mike took some of his father's tools and a piece of wood. He worked with the tools to make a wooden bowl. His father saw him working.
""What are you making, Mike?""he asked.
""I am making a wooden bowl! ""replied Mike. ""I am making it for you, father. When you grow old, like my grandfather, you will need a bowl for food. A bowl made from earth may break very easily. So I want to give you a wooden bowl""
After hearing this, Jack felt sorry and regretted having treated his father badly.",middle4896.txt
