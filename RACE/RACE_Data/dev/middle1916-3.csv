3,D,"['in the evening', 'for one or two weeks', 'for two months', 'very often']",Children near the beach can enjoy the sea  _,"The final exam comes in June. When the exam ends  , the summer vacation begins. Boys and girls have about two months to relax. The summer vacation is the best time of the year for most children. The weather is usually fine. They can swim, go to summer camps or visit other places with their parents.
Of course, the beaches  are  good places for relaxing.  Some children are lucky   to live near the beach. They can often play in the water. But for the children far from the sea, they go to the beaches for one or two weeks with their parents.
Why do children like spending their summer vacation on the beaches? It is because they like the sand  , the sun, the cool wind and the sea water. There are lots of new things to see, nice things to eat, and exciting things to do.",middle1916.txt
