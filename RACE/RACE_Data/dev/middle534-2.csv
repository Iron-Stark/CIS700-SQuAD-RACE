These things have bright lights. When our eyes see bright lights just before sleep, our sleep patterns   change, a study has found.
Our body clock starts shutting us down for bed at 9 or 10 pm. But bright lights make our minds think that it is still daytime. That wakes us up and leaves us sleepless, experts say.
