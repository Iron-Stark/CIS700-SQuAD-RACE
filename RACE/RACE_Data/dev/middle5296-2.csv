2,D,"[""April Fool's Day is very popular in Asian countries"", ""according to the English story,April Fool's Day began sometime during the 1300s"", 'according to the English story,King John of England was in the habit of making a building', 'according to the English story,the citizens of one particular farm village were against what the king did']",From the passage we can know that  _  .,"While popular in the US,the April Fool's Day tradition is even more popular in European countries,such as France and Great Britain.Although the roots of the traditional tricking are unclear,the French and the British both have their own stories about the origin of the celebration.
One story holds that the first April Fool's Day was on April 1 of the year when the king of France introduced the new calendar.This new system placed the day that had formerly been the first day of a new year on April l.Many people were not used to the new calendar and continued to celebrate New Year's Day on what had become the first day of April.Thus,they became the first April Fools.Others began to give funny gifts on the day to laugh at the fools who continued to celebrate the New Year on April 1.
An English story about the day,however,says that it began sometime during the 1200s.At the time,King John was in the habit of making roads out of the paths he most often walked along.The people of one particular farm village were aware of this.To _ having their green grasslands and pastures disturbed by one of the king's roads,they built a fence that prevented the king from walking through their countryside.
The king sent a group of messengers to inform the villagers that they must remove the fence.Upon hearing that the king was planning to do this,however,the villagers developed a plan of their own.When the king's messengers arrived,they were met by the villagers pretending to be mad.The people just throw things and ran around wildly.The messengers were surprised by this and reported to King John that these people were so mad that there was no necessity of punishing them.So,the villagers saved their farmland by tricking the king.In Great Britain,tradition only allows April Fool's tricks from midnight to noon on April l.Those who try to play tricks in the afternoon become the fools themselves.",middle5296.txt
