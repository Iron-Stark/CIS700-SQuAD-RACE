0,B,"['His mother put it into his nose.', 'The boy himself pushed the ball up his nose.', 'The silver ball rolled into his nose itself.', ""The passage didn't tell us.""]",How did the silver ball go into the boy's nose?,"This is a true story in Guyana. One day, a child took some silver paper from a cigarette box. He rolled it into a tiny ball and pushed it up his nose. He couldn't get it out again. He ran crying to his mother. His mother couldn't get the paper out, either. A week later the paper was still in his nose. His nose began to have a bad smell.
So his mother took his child to the hospital. The doctor looked up his nose. She put a tiny steel rod  into his nose and felt the paper. She said she would have to cut his nose to get the paper out.
The child's mother came home looking sad. She didn't want her child to have his nose cut. He was a handsome boy and the cut would make him ugly.
Next day, the child's mother took him to her friend Sidney. Sidney lived in a house with an old woman called May. She asked to see the child, so the child let her look up his nose. He closed his eyes.
""Yes, I can see it,"" May said. ""It will be out soon!""
As she spoke, she shook black pepper on the child's nose. He gave a _ sneeze and the paper flew out. His mother was surprised. May told her to take the boy to the sea for a swim. She said the salt water would go up his nose and stop the bad smell.
So the child didn't have to go to the hospital and gave his nose cut.",middle1989.txt
