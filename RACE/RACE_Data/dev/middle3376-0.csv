Ben: Hi, Judy! I can't believe you came to join us!
Judy: Hello, Ben. I came because I like your idea: when you give, you're rich. I'm happy that I can do something for the Earth.
Ben: Right. That's why we had this plan to get our clean beach back. Do you know if Paul's coming?
I remember he had the same idea and said he would try his best to come over.
Judy: But he just called and said he wouldn't come today because it's too hot.
Ben: I can't believe it! He always says, ""We can do this and that . . . .""
Judy: Don't you know him? He only _ what should be done but never does anything.
Ben: I see. Let's forget about him. We'll have Tony and Sophie to help us soon.
Judy: That's great. So where should we start now? Should we pick up those bottles first?
Ben: Sure, let's go.",middle3376.txt
