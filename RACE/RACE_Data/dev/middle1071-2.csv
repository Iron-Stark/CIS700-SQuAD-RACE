2,A,"['He will slide onto the floor .', 'A tape recorder will play a recording of his boss .', 'A mechanical ""foot"" will kick him in the head .', 'The bed will rise higher and higher']",What will finally happen to Hiroyuki if he doesn't get up ?,"Is it difficult for you to get up in the morning? Hiroyuki's bed will solve your problem! Here is how it works.
The bed is connected to an alarm clock. First, the alarm clock rings. You have a few minutes to wake up. Next, a tape recorder in the bed plays soft music. The tape recorder in Hiroyuki's bed plays a recording of his girlfriend. She whispered in a soft voice, ""Wake up, darling, please."" After minutes later, Hiroyuki hears a recording of his boss. His boss shouts, ""Wake up at once , or you'll be late !""
If you don't get up after the second recording, a mechanical ""foot"" in the bed will kick you in the head. The bed waits a few more minutes. What! You're still in bed! Slowly the top of the bed rises higher and higher. The foot of the bed goes lower and lower. Finally you slide off the bed and onto the floor. You are out of bed awake!
Hiroyuki's bed is not in stores. There is only one bed--- the bed Hiroyuki made for a contest. Maybe someday a company will make Hiroyuki's bed and sell it in stores. Maybe people will buy millions of beds. Then Hiroyuki will be rich. If the bed makes Hiroyuki rich, he won't need to work, and he won't need to get up early!",middle1071.txt
