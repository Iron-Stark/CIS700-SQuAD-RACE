I live with my mother and brother. I don't want my brother to play with my toys . My brother is not happy. My mother tells us to make some rules. We talk about the rules together, and then we find some paper . We write the rules on it.
Here are the rules at home.
*Be friendly to everyone.
*Say please and thank you.
*Play with the toys together.
*Keep the house clean.
I like these rules. After that, when my brother plays with my toys, he always says thank you to me. And my brother and I often clean our house on Saturday, so we can keep the house clean.",middle7196.txt
