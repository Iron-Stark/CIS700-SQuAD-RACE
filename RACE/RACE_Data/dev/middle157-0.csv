Dear Ann,
I hope that you and your children will be here in two weeks. My husband and I will  go to meet you at the train station. Our town is small but it is nice and beautiful. Your son Tom can go to the sports center every day. He can play games and go swimming there. Jill  is also lucky. My son has a cat and two sheep and I have two horses. She can play with them all day.
Please don't worry. I'm sure you'll have a good time here. See you soon.
Best wishes,
Linda",middle157.txt
