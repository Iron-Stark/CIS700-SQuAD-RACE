2,D,"['Because he ate too much.', 'Because he was too old.', 'Because he ate too fast.', ""The passage didn't tell us.""]",Why did the man have an attack of hiccups?,"A man walked into a restaurant and asked for a glass of water. Then the girl in the restaurant pulled out a gun and shot him dead. Why? People asked to give reasonable explanation for the strange happening. All kinds of suggestions were made.
She was able to recognize him as a dangerous prisoner who ran away from the prison; she thought he was to rob her; she misheard what he said; asking for a glass of water had a special meaning for her and so on. All these explanations showed that the gun was used on purpose  to harm the man. The idea was easily accepted.
In fact, the explanation was that the man had an attack of hiccups . It so happened that the girl in the restaurant knew that a great and sudden fear could get rid  of hiccups. But she didn't know the gun happened to be loaded  that day.",high8385.txt
