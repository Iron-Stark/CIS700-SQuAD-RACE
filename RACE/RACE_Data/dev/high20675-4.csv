  I used to be a doctor in the children's department of a hospital. Sometimes I treated children who had been poisoned by medicine for older family members. The children didn't know the medicine was dangerous; they just knew it tasted sweet. Children easily open the bottle that we now use in China.
  Some days ago I talked about medicines with an American. He showed me a sort of plastic bottle. The design was quite simple and I'm sure our Chinese factories could produce these bottles. The top of the bottle licks but can be opened by pressing down on it while turning. This is difficult for most young children to do, though grown-ups can open these bottles very easily.
  I'm certain that the expense of making such tops would be very small. As a doctor, I'd love to see this done. And most parents would be grateful .
