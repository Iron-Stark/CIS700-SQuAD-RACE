1,C,"['Difficult.', 'Boring.', 'Easy.', 'Interesting.']",How did the writer feel about the race during the first 20 miles?,"What makes 15,000 men and women run for hours, and what makes them run through the streets on a cold day without coats? I was one of those runners.  The race is called marathon  .
I had never run more than eight miles before, and here I was training.  Since the race is in April, I had to run throughout the winter, and in Boston, winters are cold. For most people, just putting on their shirts, sweaters, jackets, and hats is exercise enough. I found myself out on the dark streets, running along ice sidewalks  . Even in gloves, my fingers got so cold that they looked like red carrots. My nose didn't get warm until lunchtime !
Finally, the big day arrived. The weather was cold, with ice and rain. Bang! The gun sounded, and we started. I didn't go anywhere at first because I was standing behind so many people. I had to wait for them to move.
At first, the running was easy.  The other runners just seemed to pull me along. Somewhere around the 20-mile mark I even said to myself, ""This is nothing, why did I train so hard?""
Then I hit ""the wall"". ""The wall"" is what marathon runners call the special point. I knew my body reached the point and I thought I couldn't go any more. I was out of breath and my legs turned into pieces of wood.  I was almost falling down.  I can't remember anything about the last five miles of the race.
I kept running though. At last, I heard a voice at the finishing line.
""You look good,"" my friend Ted said. ""How did it feel?""
""Wonderful !"" I replied.
For everything, if you devote yourself into it, there will be a way. I finished the race, at least, in my heart, I was the winner.",middle2098.txt
