0,D,"['show visitors around the zoo', 'ride elephants or horses', 'look after animals in danger', 'help children know about animals']",Special teachers at the zoo  _  .,"Zoos are places where different kinds of animals are Kept and shown for the public. At most modern zoos people can see, smell and hear animals in their natural way. Some zoos even have ""friendship farms"" where people can touch some of the animals. Here are four reasons why people need zoos.
Firstly, zoos educate people about animals and their natural environment. They give interesting information about each animal, such as where it comes from and how it lives. Special teachers at the zoo help children to understand more about the animals. Trained guides show visitors around the zoo.
Secondly, zoos are working hard to find out more about animals. New knowledge leads to improved ways of looking after animals in the zoo, and better understanding of the same animals in the wild.
Thirdly, zoos play a part in protecting animals and stopping them from disappearing. Zoos work together with each other to help the animals in danger. For example, gorillas  from Taronga Zoo were sent to live with gorillas at the Melbourne Zoo in the hope that they would give birth to babies.
Finally, zoos are important for people's enjoyment. People enjoy getting close to animals without having to cross the plains of Africa or climb the mountains of China. In the past, animal shows were common in zoos. Visitors were excited by monkeys in human clothes, and they even took rides on elephants or horses. However, today people prefer to see animals behaving naturally.
So a modern zoo is a place where animals are well cared for.",middle3887.txt
