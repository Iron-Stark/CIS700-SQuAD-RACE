1,C,"[""its members aren't interested in music"", 'there are only ten people in it', 'only your friends want to join it', 'activities are organized once a week']",A club isn't really a club if   _  .,"Dear Linda,
I have got your letter. I know that you want to have your own club, but you don't know how to start one. Do you know what makes a club, such as an English Club or a Basketball Club, successful? Here is some advice.
*Decide what kind of club to have, and come up with a nice name. Since you are interested in music, why not start a Music Club? A club is to bring people with common interests together.
*Look for members. You can start with your friends, but it isn't really a club until people you don't know want to join.
*Make rules. Get together with the members and agree on rules. Make sure that if someone breaks any rule , he or she should be _ .
*Have regular meetings. For the first time, you should make sure that all the members attend. Call the members to remind  them of it, and use the meeting to organize future meetings and other activities. I hope that these ideas may help you and that you can have your own club soon.
Yours,
Mrs. Smith",middle5711.txt
