Three things are very important: fresh air, fresh food and a simple way of life. People who live in Himalayas  are famous for their long and healthy lives. They work near their homes in the clean mountains. They don't have buses, cars or trains. They don't sit all day in busy offices. They take more exercise and eat less food than people in the cities. They eat vegetables grown by themselves. They drink milk taken from their own cows. For years, the Hunzas of the Himalayas don't need doctors, for there is not much illness. They are happy and healthy people.",middle1132.txt
