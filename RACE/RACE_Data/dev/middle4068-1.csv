1,C,"['birds or goldfish', 'birds or dogs', 'dogs or cats', 'goldfish or football']",Bell's grandfather doesn't like   _  .,"Hello! My name is Bell White. I'm eleven years old. I study in Park Brow Primary School. I have one brother. His name's Jason and he's fourteen. I don't have any sisters in the family.
We live with Grandpa in a small house in Liverpool, in the northeast of England. My parents work in Chesterfield. They come back home every weekend.
Do you like games? I like football. My favourite team is Manchester United . My friends and I often play football on Saturdays. Sometimes my brother goes with us, but he isn't good at playing football.
I have seven pets---two birds and five goldfish. I want to have a dog and a cat too, but my grandfather doesn't like them.
Please write to me soon.
