2,B,"['She wanted to drink water.', 'She was too tired to stay there.', 'The policeman helped her.', 'The owner found a way for her.']",Why did the cow get down from the roof at last?,"Do you know cows can climb onto the roof? Isn't it fun? To eat grass, a Swiss farmer Dieter Mueller's cow climbed up a roof to look for fresh grass.
Mueller said the cow was walking on a road behind the house. Then she thought the grass may be greener on the other side of it, but it didn't walk around, it decided to climb over the house. In fact the grass was not greener on the other side.
Mueller said this is a _ cow. She always does her way. And never follow his words. So it is quite difficult for her to get her down! Mueller tried to let her get down and even put a ladder up to the roof, but it doesn't work. She stayed up there as long as she liked. She just had to do things in her own sweet time.
At last she was tired to stay on the farmhouse roof and found the way to get down herself.
That's really good news.",middle5069.txt
