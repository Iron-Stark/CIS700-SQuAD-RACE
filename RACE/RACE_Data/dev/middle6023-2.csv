2,C,"['when they meet the water and grass for the first time', 'when he finds the second oasis', 'before he meets the first oasis', 'after they meet the water and grass for the second time.']",The son does not know what water and grass look like   _  .,"A mother camel is walking with her son through the desert .They are looking for water and grass. The son asks his mother what water and grass look like. The mother answers that water is blue and looks like the sky, while grass is green and nice.
They walk a day and a night. The son suddenly cries.""Look, mother, there's water and grass over there.""
""What a foolish talk, child!""
The water and grass are on the left, while the desert is on the right. Because the mother camel is blind in her left eye, she can see nothing with her left eye.
They go on another day and night, the young camel finds a second oasis ,but his mother still does not believe him. She says that is not an oasis, but a desert. She says she knows more than her son and can't be wrong.
Her son gets angry. When he sees an oasis again, he leaves his mother without telling her. He runs into the grass and eats his fill.",middle6023.txt
