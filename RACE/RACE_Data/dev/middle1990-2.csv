The BBC reports a new study that shows: ""Children can be taught to use their Imaginations to deal with stomachaches."" This may be very good news for parents who need a quick cure for their sick children.
Any mother or father understands the stomach problem is one of the most frequent  things their children complain about. Around twenty percent of children suffer from stomachaches that doctors cannot find a reason for.
This new research is especially good for kids with active imaginations. Researchers found that the more creative the child is, the better he or she is at imagining the pain away.
The researchers used a relaxing CD with children. A voice guided them through different fantasy  situations. One of these was pretending to be floating on a cloud. Thirty children took part in the tests. Half of them used the ""guided imagery"" method, and the other half received normal medicines. Researchers found 73.3 percent of the CD users reported a reduction in pain. This compared to only 26.7 percent of kids who got normal treatment.
Study leader Dr Miranda Tilburg was very excited about her findings. She believed that it was a very cheap and easy way to stop children's stomachaches. She said it would not work as well with adults.",middle1990.txt
