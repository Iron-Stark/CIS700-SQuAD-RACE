2,D,"['for', 'without', 'instead of', 'with']",Robinson goes to meetings  _  my boss.,"Most people who work in the offices have a boss, so do I. But my boss is a little unusual. What's unusual about him? It's a big dog. Many men have dogs, but few men bring their dogs to the office every day. My boss's dog, Robinson, is a big and brown one. My boss brings him to work every day. He takes the dog to meetings and he takes the dog to lunch. When there is a telephone call for my boss, I always know if he is in the office. I only look under his desk. If I see something brown and hairy under it, I know my boss is somewhere in the office. If there is no dog, I know my boss is out.",middle1422.txt
