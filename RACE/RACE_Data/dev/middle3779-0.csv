A recent survey among high school students in China, Japan, South Korea and the US found that Asian teenagers cared more about their appearance   than teenagers in the US.
The survey was made in 156 high schools in the four countries. South Koreans cared most about their appearance. They were followed by the Chinese and Japanese, while US students showed the least interest in fashion.
