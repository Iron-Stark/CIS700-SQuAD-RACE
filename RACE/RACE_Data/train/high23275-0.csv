0,C,"['in England', ""in the Queen's party"", 'in America', 'in a poor restaurant']",It is certain that the story happened   _  .,"A man in a very splendid restaurant started to take off his jacket. Seeing this, the head waiter ran to his table and said, ""I'm afraid I must ask you to keep your jacket on, sir, for it is not good manners to do it in such a smart restaurant.""

The Queen looked over and said, 'You may do that in the United States, but you may not do it here.' So I got the Queen's permission, right?""",high23275.txt
