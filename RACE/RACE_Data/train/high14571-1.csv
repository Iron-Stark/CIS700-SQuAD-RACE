The most important thing to keep in mind when going into high school is to be yourself.Besides, I don't know what your middle school was like, but high school teachers will not care about things such as how much homework you already have in one night.It's best to just learn to deal with things and manage your time wisely so you can achieve everything you need to.

I think almost every kid feels both nervous and excited before their first day.You will probably love it.I know I did.You should join some sports or activities that will make your high school experience more enjoyable.Good luck!

When I started high school I was really nervous too,especially since I had been homeschooled all through middle school and didn't really know anyone.I suppose the best advice would be to just relax.The first couple of days can be a little bit hard,but things will become easier before you know it.

I'm not going to lie.The first day is kind of frightening .But you'll get used to it.Don't be afraid of anyone;upperclassmen will pick on  you more if you let them know you're afraid.Just take it easy.Making some friends and staying with them will greatly help you get used to high school quickly.After the first week it's really not bad at all.Don't worry.",high14571.txt
