The judge said,""You may go to prison,or you may go to Camp Green Lake.""Stanley was from a poor family. He had never been to camp before. So, Stanley Yelnats seems set to serve an easy sentence,which is only fair because he is as innocent as you or me. But Stanley is not going where he thinks he is.
Camp Green Lake is like no other camp anywhere. It is a place that has no lake and nothing green. Nor is it a camp,at least not the kind of camp kids look forward to in the summertime. It is only a desert wasteland,dotted with countless holes dug by the boys who live at the camp.

It doesn't take long for Stanley to realize there's more than character improvement going on at Camp Green Lake.
