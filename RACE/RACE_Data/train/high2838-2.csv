An old man lived in a small town of Germany. He had three sons and they all worked in the same factory where he had worked. After the war had begun, his sons were all made to join the army one after another and they all died in the fights. The old man was very sad. He didn't have enough food and was often hungry. And nobody helped him and he didn't know how to go on living.
It was a very cold winter night. The old man couldn't go to sleep. He had been hungry for two days and it was so cold in his room that ice could be seen. He had to get up and began to run in the room until he lay down on the floor. The next morning he had to beg from door to door. He had been to a lot of cities and knew a lot.
Once he came to a village, but the villagers were all poor and couldn't give him anything. He was too hungry to go to another village. He thought hard and found a way. He came to a police station and called out, ""Hitler is a foolish pig!""
Out came an old policeman at once. He took the old man into a room, gave him some bread and a cup of tea. Then he said, ""Don't say so in our village, sir!""
""I'm sorry, sir,"" said the old man. ""I don't know it's Hitler's hometown."" ""No, no, sir,"" the policeman said in a hurry. ""It's pigs' hometown!""",high2838.txt
