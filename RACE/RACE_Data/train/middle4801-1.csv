1,D,"['She visits many places.', 'She asks many friends.', 'She asks her parents for help.', 'She reads many books.']",How does Morgan finish the journals?,"Morgan is very happy these days. She is in Grade 7 at L.B Clarke Middle School, the USA. She gives her journals   to the teacher. She writes them in the summer holiday. She says, ""I read many books to finish them.""
In the summer holiday, most schools in the USA ask students to read. But L.B.Clarke starts a program   this year.
Students write their journals three times a week. The journals are about books they read or their everyday life. _ says a teacher in the school, ""Our program also asks them to read, but in a different way.""
Caroline, another student, finishes six journals. She writes about her favourite books and family trips.
""The program helps me learn new things,"" she says, ""and if I forget something, I can look in my journals.""",middle4801.txt
