0,C,"['Jane', 'Lucy', 'Mathew', 'No one']",_   is interested in taking photos.,"Lucy and her classmates are discussing about creating a homepage for their class.
Lucy:  What should we put on our class homepage?
Jane:     I think our class homepage should have daily or weekly news of class activities.
Mathew:  What kind of class activities?
Jane:     Something like spring outings, class meetings, a school singing competition, etc.
Mathew:  We will go for a spring outing next week, won't we? I can write something about it.
Lucy:    Great! What else should our class homepage have?
Mathew:  Um... How about photos of students' artwork, presentations, and outdoor activities?
Lucy:    Good idea! But who will take the photos?
Mathew:  As I am a fan of photography, I can take the photos.
Jane:     I've got an idea. As parents always want to know what assignments their kids do in
and after class, we can also post our weekly agenda , including in-class assignments and homework assignments, on the homepage.
Lucy:   And I think I can create a ""reading corner"" on the class homepage, too. As I am
a bookworm, I can recommend good books to our classmates.
Jane:  Great! Let's get down to work!",middle5223.txt
