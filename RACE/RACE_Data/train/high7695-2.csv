2,A,"['liked parties at school and felt guilty about borrowing money', 'had fun at school but soon forgot about her school friends', 'forgot her best friend at school until she saw the Friends Reunited website', 'was forgetful about the money']",We know from the passage that Jenny_.,"I'll be the first to admit that I am a technophobe .Who would have guessed that a website would help repay a 20-year-old loan?
I'1l always remember my last day at school. My best friend, Jenny, had organized a party in the Sixth
Form Common Room;
Jenny asked me to go to the supermarket with her to buy all the snacks. ""I'm really looking forward to this party, Stingy,"" she said. Everyone called me Stingy instead of Debbie because they thought I didn't like to spend money. Actually, it was true.
""There's lots of money in the kitty . Let's go crazy!"" Going crazy meant buying enough snacks to feed an army. It came to PS 19.90,which was a lot of money in 1982.
Jenny gave me a guilty( ) look. ""I've left-the kitty money in the common room. Can you pay and I'll give you back the money?""
""Sure,"" I replied, trying to look relaxed. ' Neither a lender or a borrower be' was my motto but I didn't want to look stingy . I gave PS20 to the impatient shop assistant.
Well, the Party was a great success. So great that I completely forgot about my loan until I was flying to America the next day.  I was going to live with my uncle's family until I started university.
I tried to get in touch with Jenny but her family had moved. My PS20 was lost. Until...
I'd heard about a website called Friends Reunited which helped people contact old school friends.  My husband helped me log on and find my school. There she was,Jenny Frost.
I'm now married with a beautiful daughter called Debbie. Does anyone know how to get in touch with Debbie 'Stingy' Jones? I still owe her PS20!
We met two months later and the PS20 was returned, plus interest of course. After all, I'm a bank manager now, so loans are my business.",high7695.txt
