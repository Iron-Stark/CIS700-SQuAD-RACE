0,C,"['in the morning', 'in the afternoon', 'at night', 'at noon']",My mother watched TV  _  when she was young.,"My mother was telling me about how she and her family got their first television when she was a teenager. Of course, it was black and white. She said she only watched it at night.
When I was young, we had only about 3 or 4 different channels. My brothers, my sisters and I would sometimes fight about which channel to watch. But we usually enjoyed the same shows.
Nowadays, we can get hundreds of channels on TV. There are channels with old movies, cooking, fishing and so on. It's amazing! I wonder how much my brothers, my sisters and I would fight if we had hundreds of channels when I was a child. Of course, we had only one television set.
These days I notice families with 2 or 3 or more television sets in their homes. I guess it stops
People from arguing over which channel to choose.",middle5984.txt
