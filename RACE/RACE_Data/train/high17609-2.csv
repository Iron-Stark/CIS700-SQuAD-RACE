2,B,"['a report', 'a story', 'an advertisement', 'a diary']",The passage above is  _  .,"Once upon a time, there was a spider with the name Anansi. He knew that he was very clever but he also knew he wasn't wise. He didn't like this, but he did not know what to do. One day he had an idea. He went around the village with a basket and asked each person to give him some of their wisdom. The people laughed at Anansi because they knew that he needed wisdom the most. So each person put a bit in his basket and wished him good luck.
Soon his basket was full, but Anansi was worried that his neighbors might be jealous( ) of his wisdom and take it from him. He decided to hide it at the top of a tall tree. When he had tied the basket to the front part of his body, he tried to climb the tree, but it was too difficult. He tried again and again with out success.
Then his youngest son walked by. ""What are you doing, father?"" he asked and Anansi told him."" Why don't you carry the basket on your back instead?"" his son said.
Anansi put the basket on his back and climbed the tree easily, but he wasn't happy. ""I walked all over the village and collected so much wisdom that I am the wisest person ever, but my baby son is still wiser than me. Take back your wisdom!"" he said. And he threw the basket of wisdom into the air and went home. And that's how wisdom went all over the world.",high17609.txt
