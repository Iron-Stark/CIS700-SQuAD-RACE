1,A,"['Sky', 'Cat', 'Wind', 'Cloud']",His cat's first name was   _   .,"Once Mr King had a cat, and he loved it very much. He called it ""Sky"", because he thought ""Sky"" was the strongest name in the world.
One day he had a meal at a restaurant with his cat. He met his old friend. He told him about his lovely cat and its name. His friend said, ""How foolish you are! Sky is not the strongest thing in the world. My cat is called 'Cloud' because cloud is stronger than sky."" After hearing this, Mr King called his cat ""Wind"" because he thought wind was stronger than cloud.
After a few days he suddenly thought that ""Wall"" was stronger than wind. And ""Mouse "" was stronger than wall. So he went to his friend to ask for an idea. His friend said, ""Don't you think 'Cat' is stronger than mouse?"" ""Yes, but...""
The man thought and thought and then decided his cat's name had better be ""Cat"" because a mouse was always afraid of a cat. Don't you think Mr King is very silly or funny?",middle3794.txt
