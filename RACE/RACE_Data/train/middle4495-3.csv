3,C,"['A Good Book Store', 'A Nice Teacher', 'Going to a Book Store', 'Buying Books at a Special Discount']",What can be the title for the passage  ?,"It's Tuesday today. After four classes in the morning, it's time for lunch. ""Boys and girls, do you want to go to the City Book Store with me this afternoon?"" Miss Cheng asks. All the students in our class are very happy, because we don't have to have three afternoon classes as usual  . So we answer, ""Yes!"" ""Well, come to the classroom after lunch,"" Miss Cheng says.
At about 1:30 pm, we take a bus to the City Book Store. We get to the store at 2:00 pm.
In the City Book Store are lots of books, but I can't read   all of them. I only read two books about my favorite subject, history. The books in the store are nice, but they are expensive. I can't afford them.
After two hours, we go to the front door   of the book store. With Miss Cheng's help, some of the students buy some books at a special discount  . Then we take a bus to our school.",middle4495.txt
