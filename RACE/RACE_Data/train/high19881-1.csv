Activities
The exhibition""Class Distinctions: Dutch Painting in the Age of Rembrandt and Vermeer""and the MFA collection show many purposes that artists have created works -- for the open market, wealthy patrons, religious organizations, and royal commissions. Music has been composed for these reasons as well.
Examine how artists create their magnificent works. First, from exhibition curator  Ronni Baer, hear an overview of""Class Distinctions"", an exhibition designed to encourage close looking at paintings to recognize clues embedded   in the works that refer to social rank and status. Then listen to beautiful works for string quartet by Purcell, Mozart, and Bartok.
