1,C,"[""The old couple couldn't afford the meal."", 'The old couple paid the meal by small change.', 'The old couple had a free meal in the end', 'The old couple bought the man a big breakfast']",What have you learnt from the story?,"After our hospital visit, my husband and I needed cheering up, so we thought we would treat ourselves to a big breakfast at our favorite restaurant. While we were waiting for our meals, we decided to use all our small change and make our wallets light, so we counted it out as we waited.
I vaguely  remember seeing a man sitting nearby. When our meals arrived, we found a note. It read,"" Your breakfast has been paid for. Hope you have a lovely day.""
It was a wonderful surprise as nothing like that had ever happened to us. He must have thought we could hardly pay the bill. We looked around to thank him, but he had left. As retirees ,we were grateful for the help like this, but it was the kindness of a total stranger that meant so much more to us.",middle21.txt
