0,B,"['you are glad to share the room with him or her', 'you will live with him or her in the same room for some time', 'you will ask him or her for help in the future', 'strangers are very difficult to deal with']",You should try to be polite to your roommate because  _  .,"Starting college can be a difficult experience. You have to deal with new responsibilities and growing independence, a challenging course load and, of course, the social scene. When a roommate is thrown into the mix, it may feel like you're struggling with all that stuff while living in a small box with a stranger.
But having a roommate doesn't need to be one more thing to worry about. When students go into their living situations with realistic expectations and a willingness to compromise, things can work out just fine.
When you first meet your roommate, chances are you'll be on your best behaviour. You want to get along, since this is the person who's going to be sharing your living space for the next year. But try to think ahead to potential   worst cases, too.
For example, imagine it's 2 a.m. and you're working on a paper that should be finished in 8 hours. Your roommate comes in from a party and wants to continue the party in your room.
At times like these, you won't be feeling good. That's why talking about problems that might come up ahead of time -- and respecting each other's wishes when the time comes -- is so important.
Talk about the things that are really important to you, and make sure your roommate understands. Then encourage him or her to do the same.
For example, does it make you angry when people take things without asking first? Let your roommate know your feelings about these types of things from the start, so that both of you have a feel for each other's likes, dislikes, and habits.",high1924.txt
