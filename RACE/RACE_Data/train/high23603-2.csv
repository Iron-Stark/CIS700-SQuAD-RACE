2,A,"[""Google Allows You to Track Friends' and Families' Every Move"", 'Google and BlackBerry Open the New Webs to Their Customers', 'Latitude Working on Computers is Being Developed by Google', 'Latitude Sets a Good Example on Mobile Phone Privacy Settings']",The best title of the passage might be     .,"Millions of people will be able to track each and every move by friends and family through their mobile phones,thanks to a new feature launched by Google yesterday.  
The new system named ""Latitude"" uses a map to show exactly where a loved one is at any time, sometimes discovering their location to a few meters.Worried parents will be able to check up on where their children have got to after school, friends can meet for a quick drink if they see they are nearby and wives will be able to see if their husbands really are working late at the office.  
The feature was made available immediately on millions of mobile phones that can access the web,such as the BlackBerry.Within weeks Google hopes to launch a new one that wilt also work on computers as well.  
""Once you've shared your location,you can hide it from all of your friends at once,or you can turn off Google Latitude completely at any time."" said a Google spokesman.""You can adjust your privacy settings in Latitude so that you share as much or as little about your location as you want,with whom you want.""  
Google said that the company had tested the product with thousands of people to make sure that it was safe for the customers,but experts were not so sure.Simon Davies,director of Privacy International,said Latitude would open up a ""privacy minefield "".  
""It's about the little white lies.You might be avoiding going to work, and now your boss might be able to see that you're at Twickenham instead of at home.""said Ian Angell, an information expert at the London School of Economics.""You've already got mobile phone technology where husbands and wives track each other in secret.Now Google is so widely used that it will only worsen the situation.""",high23603.txt
