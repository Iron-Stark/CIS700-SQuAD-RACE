0,B,"['The grandma', 'Miss Taylor', 'Mrs Taylor', 'Queen']",Who is the writer of the poem?,"My Favourite Sweater
by Bonnie Highsmith Taylor
My favourite sweater grew too small.
I love that sweater best of all.
My grandma made it when I was three.
She made that sweater just for me.
I picked the yarn , a special blue.
The color of bluebells, wet with dew 
When I was three I was very small
But now I'm five and much too tall
I have a new jacket now that's green
So I gave my sweater to our cat Queen.
Queen just had _ out in the shed  
My favourite sweater is now their bed.",middle4822.txt
