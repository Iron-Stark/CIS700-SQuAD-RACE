1,B,"['We must learn to climb tall buildings.', 'If we have a dream, we must be brave and hold on to it.', 'If we say ""I can do it"", we can climb tall buildings.', 'We must climb tall buildings to raise money for charity.']",What can you learn from this passage?,"As a child, Alain Robert was afraid of height. One day, when he was 12, he returned home from school. At the front door of his building, he looked for his keys. He didn't have them. It was 3.30 p.m. and his parents worked until 6.00 p.m. Alain looked at his apartment on the eighth floor. He saw an open window. He closed his eyes and imagined   himself climbing the building. When he opened his eyes, he told himself,""I can do it.""Fifteen minutes later, he was in his house and his fear   of height was gone.
Today Alain still climbs buildings. In 2003, he climbed a building in London dressed as Spiderman   to advertise the movie. In 2004, he climbed Taipei 101(one of the tallest buildings in the world). To reach the top of a building, Alain uses only his hands and special shoes. He has no rope or other safety tools.
Alain climbs as a hobby. He also does it to raise money for _ (for poor children and the homeless).When he climbs, he wants to send a massage to people. If you have a dream----something you really want to do, it can become real. But you must be brave and keep trying. If something bad happens, don't give up. Close your eyes and tell yourself, ""I can do it.""",middle5756.txt
