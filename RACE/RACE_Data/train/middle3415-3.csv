by Bonnie Highswith Taylor
My favorite sweater grew too small.
I love that sweater best of all.
My grandma made it when I was three.
She made that sweater just for me.
I picked the yarn , a special blue.
The color of bluebells, wet with dew  .
When I was three I was very small.
But now I'm five and much too tall.
I have a new jacket now that's green.
So I gave my sweater to our cat Queen.
Queen just had kittens out in the shed  . 
My favorite sweater is now their bed.",middle3415.txt
