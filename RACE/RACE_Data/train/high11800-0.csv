0,D,"['In October 2005.', 'In March 2006.', 'In May 2007.', 'In March 2007.']","According to the passage, when did Ruthie get together with her family?","It's a too long story -- 17 months to be exact -- with an ending that's short and sweet. Ruthie has, finally and happily, been reunited with her family.
The story goes back to October, 2005. Ruthie, 8 months old, was sitting on the back seat of the family car when her owner walked hurriedly into a Long Island store. When Nancy Noel returned a few minutes later, Ruthie was nowhere in sight.
Nancy Noel and her husband, Lincoln Werden, got in touch with Nassau County police, put up flyers   around their Manhasset neighborhood. But no sightings of Ruthie were reported. Until last week, that is, someone sent Ruthie to a Manhattan shelter after finding her walking slowly around the Bronx -- 25 miles from where she was taken on that fateful October day.
And then, shelter workers searched Ruthie for a possible microchip   -- she had one fixed under her skin. It showed her family's name and address. Ruthie was immediately reunited with Nancy Noel and her daughter, Sara Werden.
""We never thought we would see her again,"" said Sara Werden. ""We were just amazed.""
She's no longer the tiny pup they last saw. In fact, Ruthie gained   10 pounds during her months away from home. She's on a diet now, and has already lost one and a half pounds. Ruthie also has a new friend to play with. The family had got another dog, named Holly, after losing the hope of ever finding their beloved Ruthie.",high11800.txt
