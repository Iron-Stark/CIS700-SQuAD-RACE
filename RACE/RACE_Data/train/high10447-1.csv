years.""

old man,then 1 will be the greatest archer.""

arrow and said. ""I knew that some day or other you were going to do this.That's  why
I have not taught you this secret.There is no need to kill me.My Master is still alive,
and I'm nothing before him.You must be with him for at least thirty years.And he is
very old, so go fast! Find the old man!""",high10447.txt
