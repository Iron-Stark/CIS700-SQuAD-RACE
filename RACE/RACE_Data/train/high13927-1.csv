1,D,"['He was excited that he could hardly sleep.', 'He believed that he could play it wonderfully.', ""He couldn't believe the news was true."", ""He didn't believe he could make it.""]",What was the author's reaction when he was told to play a solo in the concert?,"When I was in college,I was always very passionate about music and I was proud to be a member of our band.However,I almost gave up because of my fear of playing solos .
One day two years ago my director informed me that he wanted me to be the featured soloist in a piece of music.Of course I was terrified,but he encouraged me that everything would be OK,and that he believed me and knew that I could do it.Up until four days before the concert,I could not make it through the solo.I would always seem to get discouraged before I played it.
I decided to ask my director for help thinking that he would tell me that I didn't have to do it and that he was still proud of me.All he said was""You just have to believe yourself.""I didn't think trying his advice would hurt,so I started the next morning differently.Instead of wondering how I could mess up,I imagined myself playing through my solo with confidence and I kept on telling myself that I could do it.
The strange thing was...it worked!After that day I played the solo without any mistake.When the big concert came,although I was a little nervous,I knew that I could do this.I didn't know what was going to happen,but I realized that the only person that was holding me back from being my best,was myself.I believed myself.I thought things would go a little more differently than they had in the past.Of course,I played the solo wonderfully and I gained acclamation from all the audience.
Always do the thing that you fear the most,don't get discouraged if you fail,and just keep on trying harder.",high13927.txt
