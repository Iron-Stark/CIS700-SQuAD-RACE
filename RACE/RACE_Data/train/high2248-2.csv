2,B,"['corporate people who are always on the go', 'people on occasional business trips', 'the airline industry', 'people burning the midnight oil']",The suit draws the attention from all the following groups EXCEPT  _  .,"Busy senior managers need no longer waste time in showering themselves-an Australian company has invented a suit that can be worn while they wash.
The suit has been specially designed so that it can be cleaned under the showerhead. There is no need for soaking  ,dry cleaning-or even soap.
The Japanese market has taken a liking to the ""shower suit"",described as ""revolutionary"" by its owner Australian Wool Innovation (AWI),which is the research and marketing body that represents Australian wool-growers. Orders have been placed for 170,000 of the woolen suits.
The suit could be worn in the shower,although it was probably better to hang it on a clothes hanger and carry it instead,AWI corporate affairs spokesman Stephen Feighan said.""The idea is that you hang it up and then...you give it a spray  ,and it's dry the next morning,"" Mr Feighan said.
A Japanese researcher working for AWI invented the suit by combining three technologies. The secret is the best lining  ,which allows the suit to dry quickly.The shower suit attracted busy corporate people,particularly those who often traveled or stayed up late,Mr Feighan said.The airline industry was also interested.
Mr Feighan confessed he had not worn one of the suits yet,or tried to wash it in the shower,because they cut to fit Japanese figures.AWI believes that the shower suit will spread from the Japanese market through Europe and India. Mr Feighan hoped the suit,made from local wool,would be available in Australia in 12 to 18 months' time.",high2248.txt
