2,B,"['thought himself very handsome', 'wanted to make friends with Miss Eyre', 'disagreed with the answer of the author', 'wished Miss Eyre to change his character']",We Can infer from the text that Mr.Rochester  _  .,"For several days I saw little of Mr.Rochester.In the morning he seemed much occupied with business,and in the afternoon gentlemen from the neighborhood called and sometimes stayed to dine with him.When his foot was well enough,he rode out a great deal.
     During this time,all my knowledge of him was limited to occasional meetings about the house,when he would sometimes pass me coldly,and sometimes bow and smile.His changes of manner did not offend me,because I saw that I had nothing to do with the cause of them.
     One evening,several days later,1 was invited to talk to Mr.Rochester after dinner.He was sitting in his armchair,and looked not quite so serious.There was a smile on his lips,and.his eyes were bright,probably with wine.As 1 was looking at him,he suddenly turned,and asked me,""do you think I'm handsome,Miss Eyre?''
     The answer somehow slipped from my tongue before I realized it,""No,sir.""
   ""Ah,you really are unusual!""
   ""Sir,I'm sorry.I should have said that beauty doesn't matter,or something like that.""
   ""No.You have honesty and feeling.There ale not many girls like you.But perhaps I go too fast.But I mean you're the sort of person people tell their problems and secrets to,because you're sympathetic and give them hope.""
It seemed he had quite a lot to talk to me.He didn't seem to like to finish the talk quickly.""Don't be afraid of me,Miss Eyre.""He continued.""You don't relax or laugh very much.But in time you will be more natural with me,and laugh,and speak freely.You're like a bird in a cage.When you get out of the cage.You'11 fly very high.Good night.""",high24221.txt
