3,D,"['We should write and carve to record different kinds of feelings.', 'We should record different kinds of things in different ways.', 'We should remember both good things and bad things.', 'We should remember only good things others have done to us and let go bad things.']",What can we learn from the last sentence of the passage?,"Two friends were walking through the desert. During the journey they had an argument , and the taller boy slapped  the shorter one in the face. The short boy was hurt, but without saying anything, he wrote in the sand: ""Today my best friend slapped me in the face.""
They kept on walking until they found a pond, and they decided to take a bath there. But the short boy got stuck in the mud  and started to sink . He cried, ""Help! Help!"" Luckily, he was pulled to safety by his friend. After that, he carved on a stone: ""Today my best friend saved my life.""
The taller boy asked him, ""After I hurt you, you wrote it in the sand and now you carve it on a stone. Why?""
The shorter boy replied: ""When someone hurts you, you should write it in the sand where winds can erase  it easily. But when someone does something good for you, you must carve it in the stone where no wind can ever erase it.""
You have to learn to write your hurts in the sand and to carve your benefits in the stone.
