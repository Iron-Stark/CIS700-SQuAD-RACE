4,C,"['to coax the child to do his homework', 'to make the child study', 'not to make the child work on his lessons', 'not to help the child with his study']","From the passage, parents should learn that it's better   _  .","Some parents are worrying that their children wouldn't like meals. In fact, most children are usually ready to eat almost anything that is offered to them. A child often likes food unless it is badly cooked. Never ask a child whether he likes or dislikes a food, never discuss likes and dislikes in front of him or allow anybody else to do so . If the father says that he hates fat meat or the mother refuses some vegetables in the child's hearing, he may copy this action. Parents should agree to the fact that he likes everything and he probably will . At meal times, it is a good idea to give a child a small part at one time rather than give him as much as he may eat all together. Do not talk too much to the child during meal times, but let him get on with his food. And do not allow him to leave the table at once after a meal , or he will soon learn to eat his food hurriedly so he can hurry back to the toys in his room . Never coax or make a child eat, or he will think he eats for you. Don't you think it is the same with study ?",middle2553.txt
