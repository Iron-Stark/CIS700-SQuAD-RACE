1,C,"[""feeling good about oneself doesn't mean you lead a happier life"", ""people with high esteem usually do not seek other's help"", 'people with high esteem tend to be proud', 'people with low esteem are often more popular']",One of the conclusions of the new research is that   _  .,"Everyone has good days and bad days.
Sometimes, you feel as if you're on top of the world. But occasionally you feel horrible, and you lose things and you cannot focus on your schoolwork.
For more than 20 years, scientists have suggested that high self-esteem   is the key to success. Now, new research shows that focusing just on building self-esteem may not be helpful. In some cases, having high self-esteem can bring bad results if it makes you less likeable or more upset when you fail at something.
""Forget about self-esteem,"" says Jennifer Crocker, a psychologist   at the University of Michigan, US. ""It's not the important thing.""
Feeling good
Crocker's advice may sound a bit strange because it is good to feel good about yourself.
Studies show that people with high self-esteem are less likely to be depressed, anxious, shy, or lonely than those with low self-esteem.
But, after reviewing about 18,000 studies on self-esteem, Roy Baumeister, a psychologist at Florida State University, has found that building up your self-esteem will not necessarily make you a better person.
He believes that violent and wicked people often have the highest self-esteem of all. He also said: ""There's no evidence that kids with high self-esteem do better in school.""
Problems
All types of people have problems. People with high self-esteem can have big egos   that can make them less likeable to their peers , said Kathleen Vohs, a psychology professor at Columbia University.
People with high self-esteem tend to think more of themselves, Vohs says. People with low self-esteem are more likely to rely on their friends when they need help.
What to do
Researchers say it is best to listen to and support other people. Find positive ways to contribute to society. If you fail at something try to learn from the experience. ""The best therapy   is to recognize your faults,"" Vohs says. ""It's OK to say, 'I'm not so good at that,' and then move on.""",high7504.txt
