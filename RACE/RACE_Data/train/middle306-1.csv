""Our parents hold too high _ which put us under lots of pressure. They care too much about our lives and studies,"" one student said.
""It's impolite that some students' parents read their children's diaries without permission!"" one student said angrily.
""Some of our teachers are so serious that we can't make friends with them at all,"" another student said sadly.
Voice of the parents:
One mother said, ""After school, my daughter usually locks herself into her room and spends lots of time talking with others on the phone. And I can't stand her clothes and hairstyle!""
""I thought my son was doing very well in his studies. I didn't realize I was being cheated by him until I got a call from his teacher,"" said a father.
Voice of the teachers:
An English teacher said, ""Today, the role of the teacher is to put knowledge into students' brains. The power of teachers has kept students away from them.""
""Some parents pay too much attention to their children's grades instead of creating a lively and colorful environment at home,"" another teacher said.
""In the past, teachers and students often played games together or talked with each other. Today, only studies and grades are talked about,"" said a teacher. ""A school should be a place where students can learn not only knowledge, but also how to face failure and frustration bravely enough.",middle306.txt
