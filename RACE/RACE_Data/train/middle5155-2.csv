2,A,"['He does what he likes to do.', 'He fights with his brother.', 'He eats a lot of food.', 'He talks with his neighbors.']",How does Daniel often deal with his fear?,"How do you feel when your parents are not at home with you? Here is what Daniel and Laura said.
Daniel:
Well, I've had the experience of having to take care of my younger brother by myself. Sometimes it's scary, but there are a lot of things making being at home alone fun. My favorite thing to do is to watch television. It is like having another person to talk to. And if my brother and I are arguing, we make a deal  . We play his game first, then he has to play mine, and both of us get what we want. When I get a little scared, I just remember that there is always someone to call on the phone. I can call my parents and I have my next door neighbors, too.
Laura:
When I started staying at home alone, I found that keeping the television or the radio on helped to make me feel easy. I also always had the phone numbers of my parents and the neighbors. When babysitting my younger brothers, I would play games with them, and leave more lights on than usual. I would also keep the phone number of the hospital nearby.
