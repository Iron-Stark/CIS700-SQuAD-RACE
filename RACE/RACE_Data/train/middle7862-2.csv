what the robber looks like and tell the police later.
If you are in a traffic accident
If a car hits you, you should remember the car number. If it is a bicycle, try to call your parents before you let the rider go. This is because you don't know how seriously you are hurt.

Don't stay in high places and stay away from trees.
If there is a fire
Get away as fast as yon can. Put wet things on your body and try to find an exit . Do not take the lift.
If someone is drowning

Remember that danger is never as far away as you think. Take care of yourself at all time!",middle7862.txt
