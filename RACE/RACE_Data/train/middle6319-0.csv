0,B,"['with a small pot', 'by cupping his both hands', 'with the help of the large deer', 'by using an empty bottle']",The boy carried the water to the baby deer  _  .,"It was one of the hottest days of the dry season. There was no rain for almost a month. The crops  were dying. Cows stopped giving milk. On this day, I witnessed   a wonder.
I was making lunch when I saw my 6-year-old son, Billy, walking very slowly towards the woods. Minutes later he came running out again, towards the house. Soon after, I saw him walking towards the woods again. This went on for an hour. Finally I walked out of the house quietly and followed him.
Billy cupped   both hands in front of him as he walked, careful not to drop the water he carried. Then I saw an amazing sight. Several large deer stood in front of him. Billy walked right up to them. I saw a baby deer lying on the ground. It was dying of thirst, and it tried to lift its head to drink the water in my boy's hands.
When the water was gone, Billy ran back to the house. I followed him to the kitchen. Billy opened the tap and a small trickle   came out. He let the drips   slowly fill up his ""cup"".
Now I understood what was going on. The week before, he tried giving water to our horses but I told him not to waste water. Now when he stood up and turned, I was there in front of him. His eyes filled with tears  . ""I'm not wasting,"" he said. I joined him with a small cup of water from the kitchen. I let him walk to the baby deer alone while I stood by the woods. Tears rolled down my face. Suddenly there were some drops falling, as if the sky itself was crying.",middle6319.txt
