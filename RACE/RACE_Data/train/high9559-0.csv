0,C,"[""Agatha's governess"", ""the name of Agatha's novel"", 'another name for Agatha', ""the heroine of Agatha's novel""]",Mary Westmacott is  _  .,"Agatha Christie (1890-1976) was born Agatha May Clarissa Miller in Devon, England in 1890, the youngest of three children in a conservative, well-to-do family. Taught at home by a governess and tutors, as a child Agatha Christie never attended school. She became skillful at creating games to keep herself occupied at a very young age. A _ l child, unable to adequately express her feelings, she first turned to music as a means of expression and, later in life, to writing.
In 1914, at the age of 24, she married Archie Christie, a World War I fighter pilot. While he was off at war, she worked as a nurse. It was while working in a hospital during the war that Christie first came up with the idea of writing a detective novel. Although it was completed in a year, it wasn't published until 1920, five years later.
""The mysterious Affair at Styles"" gave the world the unique Hercule Poirot, a retired Belgian police officer who was to become one of the most enduring characters in all of fiction. With his waxed moustache and his ""little grey cell,"" he was ""meticulous (careful to do things correctly), a tidy little man, always neat, orderly and a bit absurd.""
Christie wrote more than 30 novels featuring Poirot. Among the most popular were"" The Murder of Roger Ackroyd""(1926), ""Murder on the Orient Expredd""(1934), and ""Death on the Nile"" (1937).
Another of Christie's most well-known and beloved characters was introduced in ""Murder at the Vicarage"" in 1930. Miss Jane Marple, an elderly single in the old- fashioned English village of St. Mary Mead, solved all manner of mysteries with intense concentration and instinct.
Christies ultimately (finally)became the acknowledged Queen of the Golden Age. In all, she wrote over 66 novel, numerous short stories and screenplays, and a series of romantic novels using the pen name Mary Westmacott. Several of her works were made into successful feature films, the most notable being Murder on the Orient Express (1974). In short, she is the single most popular mystery writer of all time. In 1971 she was awarded the high honor of becoming a Dame of the British Empire.",high9559.txt
