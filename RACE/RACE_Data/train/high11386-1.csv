I'm now busy in preparing for the Postgraduate   Entrance Exam. A few days ago, I happened to see some new guidebooks for those who want to take next year's exam. With too many hopes and without taking it into too much consideration, I bought several that were written by some known for helping candidates   for master's degrees.
