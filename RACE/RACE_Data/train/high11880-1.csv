1,B,"['getting up before the sun rises can help out of crime', 'we can hardly find a person who has no love for anybody or anything', 'travelling can help all criminals out of prison', 'young people can do anything freely']",Form the passage we may infer that   .,"Americans think that travel is good for you. Some even think it can help to solve one of the country ' s worst problems ~: crime  .
Crime worries a lot of people. Every year, the number of crimes is up and up. And many criminals  are young. They often come from sad homes, with only one parent or no parents at all.
There are many young criminals in prison,but prison doesn ' t change them. Six or seven in ten will go back to crime when they come out of prison.
One man ,Bob Burton, thought of a new idea. In the old days, young men had to live a difficult life on the road. They learned to be strong and brave, and to help their friends to be strong and brave, and to help their friends in time of danger. This helped them grow into men. So Bob Burton started ""Vision Quest. "" He takes young criminals on a long ,long journey with horses and wagons  , 3,000 miles through seven states. They are on the road for more than a year.
The young people in Vision Quest all have bad problems. Most of them have already spent time in prison. This is their last chance.
It's hard work on the road. The day starts before the sun comes up. The boys and girls have to feed the horses. Some of them have never loved anyone before  but they love their horses. That love can help them to live a new life.
Not all the young people on Vision Quest will leave crime behind them. Three or four in ten will one day be in prison again. Bob Burton is right. Travel can be good for you. Even today, Americans still say, "" Go west, young men. """,high11880.txt
