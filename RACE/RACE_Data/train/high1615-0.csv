I'm afraid I have some very bad news for you . I have been very naughty and the school master is very angry with me . She is going to write to you . You must come and take me away from here . She does not want me in the school any longer . The trouble started last night when I was smoking a cigarette in bed . As I was smoking , I heard footsteps coming towards the room .I did not want a teacher to catch me smoking , so I threw the cigarette away . Unfortunately , the cigarette fell into the waste--paper basket . It caught fire .
There was a curtain near the waste --paper basket . It caught fire ,too . Soon the whole room was burning . The master phoned the fire brigade . The school is a long way from the town and before the fire brigade arrived , the whole school was on fire . The master said that the fire was all my fault and I must pay for the damage . She will send you a bill for about a million dollars .
I'm very sorry for this .
Much love
Sarah",high1615.txt
