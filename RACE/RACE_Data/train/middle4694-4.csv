4,C,"['Most animals have their own homes.', ""The woodchuck's home often has two doors."", 'Bees usually live in the trees.', ""Cats,dogs and other pet animals live in people's homes.""]","According to the passage,which is WRONG?","We people have homes.Animals have homes,too.
Some animals live under the ground.The woodchuck lives in the holes under the ground.His home has two doors.If someone comes in through one door,he will go out through the other door.Some birds live in the holes in the trees.They come out for food during the day and go back to sleep at night.But most birds live iust in the trees.It's very interesting that turtles usually carry their homes on their backs.Bees always work hard to make their homes.Cats,dogs and some other pets live in people's homes.And we can see many kinds of animals in the zoo,so the zoo is also a big home for animals.",middle4694.txt
