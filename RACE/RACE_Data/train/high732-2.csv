2,C,"[""doesn't have any effect on men"", 'cannot improve our moods in any case', 'harms our feelings in the long run', 'pleases people by feeling like another person']",It is implied in the passage that deep acting   _  .,"Researchers found that walking around with a forced smile and fake   happiness simply leads to people feeling unhappier. So, putting a brave face on your sadness could be harmful. The research also found that women suffered more than men when pretending to be happy.
Dr. Brent Scott, who led the study, said employers should take note because forcing workers to smile when dealing with the public can result in bad outcomes. He said, ""Smiling for the sake of smiling can lead to emotional tiredness, and that's bad for the organization."" He also said the research showed customer-service workers who had ""fake smiles"" throughout the day fell into a bad mood and didn't want to work, so their productivity dropped.
The study is one of the first of its kind to examine emotional expressions over a period of time and compare the different effects on men and women. Dr. Scott's team examined the effects of ""surface acting"", or fake smiling, compared to ""deep acting"", or making people smile by thinking of peasant memories.
Dr. Scott said, ""Women were harmed more by surface acting, meaning their moods worsened even more than men's. However, they were helped more by deep acting, which means their moods improved more by thinking of pleasant memories. ""
According to Dr. Scott, women tend to suffer more when pretending to be happy because they are expected to be more emotionally expressive than men. Therefore, forcing a smile while feeling down is more likely to go against their normal behavior and cause more harmful feelings.
Although deep acting can improve moods a little in the short term, Dr. Scott says, it's not a long-term solution to feeling unhappy. ""There have been some suggestions that if you do this over a long period you start to feel unreal. You're trying to develop positive emotions, but at the end of the day you may not feel like yourself any more.""",high732.txt
