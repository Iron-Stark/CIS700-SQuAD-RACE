2,D,"['She told her story to the pregnant waitress.', 'She helped the pregnant waitress lay the table.', 'She taught the pregnant waitress how to help others.', 'She left the kind waitress a good tip.']",What did the lady do in the cafe?,"One day a man saw a lady on the road. Her car broke down and she needed help.
The man stopped his car and said: ""I'm here to help you. You can call me Bryan Anderson."" After he fixed the car, the lady wanted to pay him.
But Bryan said no. He said if she really wanted to pay him back, the next time she saw someone who needed help, she could give that person the help he or she needed.
A few miles down the road the lady went into a small cafe. The waitress came over. The lady noticed the waitress was nearly eight months pregnant  , but she never let it change her attitude   when she served   her.
The lady finished her meal and paid with a $100 bill. The waitress went to get the change. When she came back, she found the lady had gone and left a note on a piece of paper: ""You don't owe   me anything. Somebody once helped me the way I'm helping you. If you really want to pay me back, here is what you do: Do not let the love end with you.""
Under the paper were four more $100 bills.
The waitress was moved. She really needed the money, as the baby would soon arrive. Then she called her husband: ""Everything will be all right. I love you, Bryan Anderson.""",middle3731.txt
