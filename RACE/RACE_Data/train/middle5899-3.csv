Mike loves visiting old building. So does Jack.
In the village Jack and Mike see a beautiful old church  , but when they come into the church, some people are there. They don't know what the people are doing.
""Oh! Just sit quietly  , and act like the others!""Mike says. Because they don't really know French, so they stand, kneel and sit to follow other people.
At that time, the priest   says something. And the man who sits next to Jack and Mike stands up.
""We should stand up, too!""Jack whispers to Mike.

Mike shakes his head. He smiles and says, ""We should understand what people do before we act like them!""",middle5899.txt
