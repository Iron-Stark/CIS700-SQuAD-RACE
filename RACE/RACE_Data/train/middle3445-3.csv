3,A,"['London Zoo told them what kind of snake it was', 'Mr. Jackson sent the photo to the hospital', 'he left hospital the next day', 'the snake bit him']",The doctors gave Mr. Jackson the right medicine when  _  .,"If a snake bites you, take a photo with your mobile phone! It save your life. This is the surprising advice of a British cook. One day Henry Jackson was working in a restaurant kitchen. He picked up a dish from a table, and suddenly a snake appeared and bit him on the hand. A few days earlier, the snake came to the restaurant from Asia in a box of bananas. It climbed out of the box and hid under the dish. "" I tried to pick it up and it bit me. I threw it away, but it landed in the fridge. So I closed the door."" Jackson said. Anyway, Jackson was cool and he took a photo of the snake with his mobile phone. Soon his hand began to ache and he went to hospital. Then his chest began to hurt. Doctors couldn't say what was wrong because they didn't know what kind of snake it was.
Then Jackson remembered his mobile phone photo. The doctors sent it to London Zoo. When they knew the kind of snake, they could give Jackson the right medicine, and he left hospital the next day. "" So my advice is this: If a snake bits you, pick up your phone. Take its photo first and then call the hospital. Show the photo to the doctors,"" suggests Mr. Jackson. "" Oh, and if the snake doesn't smile for its photo, don't worry!""",middle3445.txt
