Clubbers were enjoying an evening at Pulse , which describes itself as "" the hottest gay bar in Orlando , "" when shots started to go off around 2 am. A hostage situation occurred , and didn't end until authorities used a vehicle armed to teeth to break down the door of the building and kill the gunman at around 5 am .
Sunday morning's attack surpasses the shootings at Virginia Tech in 2007 and Sndy Hook Elementary School in 2012 to become the worst mass shooting in US history .
Authorities have identified the shooter as 29-year-old Omar Saddiqui Mateen from Fort Pierce , about 120 miles southeast of Orlando . CNN reports Mr. Mateen was previously trained as a security guard .

But Mateen's connection to Islamic terrorism has not been proven , leading authorities to also investigate the shooting as a possible hate crime against the LGBT community .
