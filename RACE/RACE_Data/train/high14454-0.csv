0,D,"['To show off her excellent work.', 'To have him type it on the computer.', 'To ask him to make some changes from all details.', 'To ask him to give her some advice.']",Why did the author give her business plan to her husband at first?,"I wrote a business plan the other day. I gave it to my husband for suggestions. After reading it, he said, ""I don't think this is up to your usual standards."" I said, ""I need more information. What doesn't work?"" He said he wasn't sure. I then took the letter and reread it.
He asked, ""How about if I look at it again and make notes between the space?"" I agreed. A half hour later I looked at his notes and told him he didn't understand the situation and what I really wanted to express. He shrugged   and said OK. I took the letter and went back to my computer and again revised. As I was writing, I could see my letter improving based on his suggestions. When I finished, I proudly handed the letter back to my husband. He read it for the third time and said, ""It's still not right but I couldn't exactly say."" I was a little annoyed and then told him I was the writer and I had seen some goofy letters he sent out. But I picked up my letter and went back to the computer.
After an hour of revisions, I went back to my husband apologetically with letter in hand. I told him I was sorry for what I'd said and asked if he would please read the letter again because I did value his contribution. Being a very patient and kind-hearted fellow, he once again read my letter and declared that it was fine.
This all leads me to the following: When you ask for advice on a project, be appreciative and grateful. Understand that the advice and suggestions you get may be negative. Understand that it may mean more work for you. And keep in mind that the final responsibility for the project is still yours. So be modest and thankful even if he or she has noted some problems.",high14454.txt
