3,B,"[""Why the writer didn't want to keep cats any more."", 'How the writer found a cat and raised  it.', ""How the writer's family looked after a cat."", ""What the writer did to find the cat's owner.""]",What is the passage mainly about?,"Something was crying outside. So I went out to see what was happening. A big cat sat by the door. It must run for a long time as it looked tired and dirty. I let it in my house and took out some food; this poor cat ate all, but still looked starving..., so I got my own cats' fish, and the cat ate that too!
My five-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter were interested in the cat. They bathed (......) it and fed it more food. They wanted to keep it. But I didn't agree. It was not because I didn't love it. We already had 2 cats and 2 dogs and our house was not big enough to keep more. Another reason was that I thought maybe it got lost. And its owner   must be worried about it. Then I posted notices all over the town in the hope of finding its home. I also bought an ad  time on a radio station. Three weeks passed, but there was no response  .
Finally, I decided to keep the cat. Our house was small, but I would take good care of it as possible as I could.",middle2249.txt
