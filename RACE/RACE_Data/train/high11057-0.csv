0,B,"['it can save time and money', 'food can be cooked simply and healthily', 'it is easy to clean and store', 'it is available in any store']",The food steamer is popular with people because   _  .,"The latest fashion in the kitchen is the food steamer.All the stores are selling them;everyone wants one.Steaming is one of the simplest and healthiest ways of cooking food.However,that cooking time is usually longer than with other methods.In case you're thinking of buying a steamer,I've done a survey about the steamers available on the market to help you decide which will suit you best.
Folding Steamer
The simplest and least expensive is the folding stainless-steel version.
Advantages:This is a good,basic design which sits inside a variety of different shapes of  pans with the water under it;a ring in the centre allows for easy lifting and it's easy to clean.
Disadvantages:It only holds small dishes.Also,if you put too much water in the pan,it will boil up through the vegetables and they will be watery.If you put too little water in and let it get dry,you will burn the pan and get strange-smelling vegetables.
Steaming Pan
This is a three-layered black Teflon-coated version with a lid and two double-handled  steamers,which sits on the oven ring.The brand I bought is calledNutritious Living.
Advantages:This is an excellent steamer, lightweight,easy to clean,and of all the steamers I've tried,this cooks the fastest.Fish and chicken can be cooked on the bottom with rice or vegetables on the top.It's easier to store.
Disadvantages:Water can boil away until the pan is dry,but if you make sure you fill the  pan up to the suggested level and do not overcook the food,this should not happen.You cannot  see the food cooking from the top.It doesn't supply a dish for cooking rice.
For serious users of steamers,I recommend having one of each version.If you just want  to try it,get the folding stainless-steel type.",high11057.txt
