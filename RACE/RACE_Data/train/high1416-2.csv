2,A,"['Environmental Health Management after Natural Disasters', 'The Bad Influence of the Natural Disasters', 'Useful Measures to Avoid the Natural Disasters', 'The Importance of the Environmental Health Management']",The best title of this passage should be   _  .,"Environmental health is defined as the control of the factors   in the environment that may have harmful effects on people's physical, mental, or social well-being  . Because natural disasters expose people to danger by bringing up or threatening their immediate environment, effective management of environmental health after a natural disaster is of great importance.
The environmental health measures that must be considered after a natural disaster include the supply of appropriate shelter for individuals or groups of people left homeless, the distribution   of safe and accessible water, and the protection and distribution of safe food products and so on.
To effectively manage environmental health during and after a disaster, it is important that a state of preparation is in effect before the event actually occurs. During an emergency, success largely depends on making good, rapid judgment and appropriate response measures. High-level decision makers, therefore, must be familiar with sound measures beforehand and should be given an accurate judgment of the disaster's specific effects as quickly as possible.
This book is intended to serve as a guide for those who may be called upon to make emergency decisions after disaster strikes. The recommended environmental health measures have been listed in the order of priority in which they should be taken during an emergency. However, each natural disaster is unique in the degree or type of emergency. In response to any given disaster, decision makers may find it necessary to change the priority assigned to any particular measure.",high1416.txt
