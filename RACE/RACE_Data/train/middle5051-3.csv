3,C,"[""I didn't call them"", ""I didn't want more"", 'the red was outside', ""they didn't like me""]",Why didn't the waiters serve me later ? Because  _  .,"Roast   is very famous in Brazil. Customs   just sit , waiting for waiters to send them all kinds of meat. If you like , you take one ; if you don't , the waiters pass you . If you don't give any messages of stopping , they will go on.
One day when I was in Brazil , I went to a restaurant to try the roast . After I took my seat, the waiter gave me a sign with the color ""red"" on the side and ""green"" on the other . I said ""thank you"", then the waiters began to serve me .My plate was already full, but the waiters still kept on serving me more. I thought I had to eat more quickly . But to my surprise, the waiters still kept on serving more. Then a waiter found out the reason. He helped me turn the sign over, with red outside . When I finished , I found the waiter didn't take a look at me . Do you know Why? It's just like the traffic lights in the street . How wonderful !",middle5051.txt
