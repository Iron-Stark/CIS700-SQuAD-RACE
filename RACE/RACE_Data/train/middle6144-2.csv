2,B,"['Leopards have beautiful fur', 'Leopards eat animals and plants', 'Leopards sleep 12 hours a day', 'The Sinai leopard probably extinct']",Which is not true ?,"Leopards   live in many parts of the world, from Siberia to Africa. They have a very beautiful yellow skin with large black spots. They live for about 15 years and eat small mammals   such as zebras, monkeys, and antelopes   .They sleep for about 12 hours a day . Leopards are very solitary animals. They spend most of their time alone in trees, where they wait until a small animal passes. They jump on the animal and then drag it up into the tree, where they eat it.
