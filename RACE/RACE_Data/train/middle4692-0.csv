I don't have a good time at my new school.There are too many rules at my school.We have to get to school at seven o'clock every morning.We can't play games in the classroom after class.We can't listen to music in the hallways.I don't like playing the piano,but I have to learn the piano in the music class.And we have to wear uniforms at school.We also can't eat outside.and we have to eat in the dining hall.The food there is awful.I can't stand  the rules here.I never have fun.What can I do?
