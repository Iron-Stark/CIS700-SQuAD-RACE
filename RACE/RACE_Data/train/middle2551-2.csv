2,D,"['Because he had money.', 'Because he liked his cousin.', 'Because he knew the way.', 'Because he liked bananas.']",Why did Bruce go to buy bananas happily?,"The telephone rang when Mrs. Gates was cooking lunch. Her son Bruce went to answer the phone. His aunt said she was coming to see them with her daughter that afternoon. Mrs. Gates was happy because she hadn't seen her sister for several months. She knew the girl liked bananas very much, but she was busy in the kitchen and couldn't go to buy any for her. She gave some money to Bruce and said, ""Go and buy two kilos of bananas in the shop. ""
Bruce liked bananas, too. He went out happily. Half an hour later he came back with a bag in his hand. Mrs. Gates weighed the bananas and found they were half a kilo short. She took the bag to the shopkeeper and said, ""I sent my little son for two kilos of bananas, but you gave him only one and a half kilos!"" ""Have you weighed your little son yet, madam?"" asked the shopkeeper, ""My scales   are all right.""",middle2551.txt
