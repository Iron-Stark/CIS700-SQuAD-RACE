2,B,"['It makes big sounds.', ""Its front lights don't work"", ""He can't start it."", ""He can't find the key""]",What's wrong with Mike's car?,"Dear John,
I'm very happy about your coming to Chichester next week.The day after tomorrow is Monday and I have to go away on business for three days.I'11 leave a key to my neighbor at No.2 1.So you won't have to wait before l come back.Now let me tell you how to get here.
Walk up Star Road until you come to the first set of traffic lights and then turn right.
Walk along the road and then turn left at the first turning.Go straight,and Landsdowne Road is the second on the right.There you can find my house,the door at No.22.
Oh !I nearly forget the most important thing--please bring a sleeping bag because we may go camping.Well,I must go now.1 have to go and take the car from the garage on
Land Road.My car is in the garage because there is something wrong with its front lights.
Hope to see you soon
Yours,
Mike",middle5029.txt
