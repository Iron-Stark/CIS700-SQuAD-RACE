0,C,"['people start to throw tomatoes', 'people start to fight in groups', 'the whole tomato fight is over', 'the fight has lasted for two hours']","When the cannon shot is fired the second time,  _  .","Are you fond of tomatoes? Bunol,a town in Spain,held its yearly tomato festival on the last Wednesday of August.Thousands and thousands of people made their way from all corners of the world to fight in it,the world's biggest food fight.Tons of fully-grown tomatoes were thrown in the streets.
No one knows exactly how this event started.Maybe it came from a local food fight between friends,or a joke that was played on a bad musician.
On Wednesday,at 11am,the fight began.A cannon  shot was fired to start the fight.At first,people fought one another,but slowly they began to fight in groups.After exactly one hour,the fight ended when the cannon shot was fired once more.At this point,no more tomatoes could be thrown.
Those who attend this event are encouraged to wear protective glasses.And they must press the tomatoes before throwing so that they won't hurt others.Another rule is that no one is allowed to take anything -- such as a glass bottle -- into the fight.Although it is forbidden to tear  another person's clothing,the crowd seems to tear the shirt of any clothed person,whether they are men or women.
Fire trucks are used to clean the streets after the fight with water provided from a Roman channel  .The government seems more concerned with cleaning up the town than the visitors,and people go to the Bunol River for a wash.",high13760.txt
