3,B,"['a reporter', 'a teacher', 'a lawyer', 'a doctor']",This passage is most probably written by   _  .,"After a while, Tommy's parents, who had recently separated, would arrive for a meeting on his failing schoolwork and bad behavior. Neither parent knew that I had called the other.

Tommy's mother entered and took one of the chairs. Soon the father arrived. Good! At least they were enough to be here in time. They ignored each other.

I found a sheet in the back of his desk. Writing covered both sides: not the exercises, but a single sentence scribbled   over and over.
Silently I gave it to Tommy's mother. She read it and then handed it to her husband. Then his face softened.
At last he folded   the paper carefully, placed it in his pocket, and reached for his wife's hand. She wiped the tears from her eyes and smiled up at him. He helped with her coat and they left together.
In his own way God had given me the words to reunite that family. He had guided me to the sheet of yellow copy paper covered with the pain outpouring of a small boy's troubled heart.
The words are ""Dear Mom... Dear Daddy... I love...""",high8435.txt
