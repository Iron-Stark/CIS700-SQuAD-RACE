2,D,"['five members are in the band', 'the band had a good beginning', 'Phillip Sweet has a son', 'the members of the band are true friends']",From the passage we know that   _  .,"Maybe you've heard of many musical bands, but have you heard of Little Big Town, a country musical group? There are four members in this band, Karen Fairchild, Kimberly Schlapman, Jimi Westbrook and Phillip Sweet. They had a hard time when they began their band at first, but they didn't give up. Now it becomes very popular.
""We take care of each other and we take care of the music,"" Karen Fairchild once said after one of their shows. As a fan of this band, I once had a chance to hang out with the members of Little Big Town. We talked about their hard beginning. At that time, they even didn't have their own stage.
Fairchild also told me how the four of them were together when they were in trouble. Not only did they stand together on stage but also in their daily life. For example, they were right there when Phillip Sweet was caring for his daughter for the first time. They encouraged Kimberly Schlapman when they found her husband _ . At that time Kimberly was very sad to lose her husband. ""When we have lived such a hard life together, it bonds   us tightly,"" Phillip Sweet said. ""We find true happiness is the joy of doing what we do for a living. We love the hard beginning. We also love the wonderful future.""",middle6223.txt
