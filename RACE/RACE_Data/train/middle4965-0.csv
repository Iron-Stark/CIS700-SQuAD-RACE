0,C,"['He dreamed a terrible dream.', 'He was hurt by Jimmy.', 'He had an accident.', 'He fooled his mom with his friend.']",What happened to the writer on the April Fool's Day of 2014?,"April Fool's Day is supposed to be a day to play jokes on others in hopes of getting a good laugh and making one feel like a fool. However, the April Fool's Day of 2014 was quite different for my mom and me.
That day my friend Jimmy and I were playing a game. I had dropped down from a bar   many times in the past without ever having a problem, but that day the simple act of dropping to the ground became a nightmare  . I broke my arm.
Jimmy's dad heard my crying and rushed out to see what was going on. When he saw the problem he quickly put me into his truck and went inside to telephone my mom and let her know he would take me to hospital. As that day was April Fool's Day, Mom was not buying it and really thought all this was a big joke. Mom was finally convinced by Jimmy's mom. When she saw me, she broke down in tears because she felt so bad -she originally thought this was just a big prank  .
I guess one could compare this to the story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf. Since I had pulled pranks before, it is no wonder that my mom didn't believe it. I as well as my mom was made to look like a fool that day. We both learned a valuable lesson.",middle4965.txt
