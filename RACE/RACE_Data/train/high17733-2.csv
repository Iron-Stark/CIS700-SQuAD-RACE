Government officals in several countries with large fishing industries also questioned the research .
       The study appeared earlier this month in Science magazine .
       The researchers say damage to oceans affects not only fish populations but also the productivity of ecosystems . These complex systems help control water quality . The scientists say the loss of different kinds of sea life appeared to increase the f fish kills and beach closures from harmful algae growth .
       The scientist examined the results of thirty-two experiments and observed forty-eight protected areas . They also looked at records of catches worldwide .

And they examined archeological information and other historical records for twelve coastal areas . That research back over a thousand years .
