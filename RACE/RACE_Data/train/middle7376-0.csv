I'd like to share my suggestions about studying with you. ""Studying"" is not the same thing as ""doing homework""! Studying may include doing homework,but it also includes a lot more, as you will see. So if you say that you have no homework,and therefore you can't or you don't have to study, you're mistaken!
I am going to give you some suggestions on how to study efficiently. _ worked for me when I was in the high school and college.
Not only that, but they also worked equally well for me in literature and math.
Although everyone's learning style may be different,and some of my suggestions may not work for you, I still ask you to try them. A lot of successful students have used them.
Please send me suggestions about studying that work for you. I will try to include them into the further version of this guide.
Here are some of my suggestions:
A. Manage your time.
B. Take notes in class and rewrite them at home.
C. Study hard and study in a quiet place.
D. Read texts actively and slowly. Do it before and after class.
E. Finish your homework by yourself.
F. Do not only study for exams.
Yours,
