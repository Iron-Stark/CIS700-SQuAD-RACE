The writer, E.B. White, shows that a real friend will help you even though he or she has nothing to get from doing so.
In the book, Charlotte is always helping Wilbur. She spins  words into her web to save Wilbur's life, even though spinning the words is tiring and difficult for her. Charlotte is a true friend. She helps Wilbur for only one reason - she cares about him.
Templeton, the rat, on the other hand, is not a real friend to Wilbur. Templeton only helps others when there is something in it for him. When he is asked to help save Wilbur's life, he says ""no"" at first. Later on, he agrees to help, but only because he wants to keep eating Wilbur's meals. At the end of the book, Wilbur learns the true meaning of friendship. He helps Charlotte to save her babies. He does this not for other reasons, but because he cares about his friend.
Reading this book lets me know how important it is to help others. Being a good friend means being there when you are needed.",middle4805.txt
