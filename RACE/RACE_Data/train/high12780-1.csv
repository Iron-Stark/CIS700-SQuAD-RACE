1,D,"['prove she is a qualified instructor', 'introduce the home-study courses', 'show she has realized her dream', 'promote the writing program']",Kristi Holl mentions her own experience mainly to   _   .,"Dear Friend ,
The recent success of children's books has made the general public aware that there's a huge market out there .
And there's a growing need for new writers trained to create the $3 billion worth of children's books bought each year ... plus stories and articles needed by over 650 publishers of magazines for children and teenagers .
Who are these needed writers ? They're ordinary folks like you and me .
But am I good enough ?
I was once where you might be now . My thoughts of writing had been pushed down by self-doubt , and I didn't know where to turn for help .
Then , I accepted a free offer from the Institute to test my writing ability , and it turned out to be the inspiration I needed .
The promise that paid off
The Institute made the same promise to me that they will make to you , if you show basic writing ability :
You will complete at least one manuscript suitable to hand in to a publisher by the time you finish our course .
I really didn't expect any publication before I finished the course , but that happened . I sold three stories . And I soon discovered that was not unusual at the Institute .
Since graduation , I have authored 34 nationally published children's books and over 300 stories and articles .
Free test and brochure
We offer a free ability test and will send you a copy of our brochure describing our recognized home-study courses on the basis of one-on-one training .
Realize your writing dream today . There's nothing sadder than a dream delayed until it fades forever .
Sincerely ,
Kristi Hill , Instructor
