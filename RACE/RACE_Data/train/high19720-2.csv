Every time we slipped out to our local coffee shop to remove a creative jam, the coffee was hot and so were the laptops. Other risers were too big to carry along, so we created our own. We call it the Mini Riser. A super-compact and stylish riser designed for people using laptops.
The Mini Riser allows air to pass under your laptop (1.8 inches of lift), and supports the keyboard at a more comfortable angle. The small, open profile makes it easy to put into your laptop case or just carry along. You can adjust the heavy, bendable wire to fit your laptop by stretching or compressing the legs as needed. Everything stays in one place, and it is strong enough to support up to 35 pounds (15.9 kilograms).
INCLUDES:
2 blue Mini Risers and a printed guide showing you how to use and adjust them. That's enough for you and a friend, for home and work, or an extra just in case.
