Many students don't like the school lunch. They take their own  lunch to school. Their mothers may make hamburgers and salad for them for lunch. Some students take leftovers  for lunch. But I don't! The lunch is very _ . For only $1.3, I can eat a lot of good and healthy food. Then I take my food to my lunch table and sit  with my friends. Boys don't sit with girls. We eat lunch and we like to talk  about sports and TV shows . We also talk about school life : our favorite subjects, our favorite teachers and our favorite days.
