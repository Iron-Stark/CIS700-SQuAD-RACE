1,B,"['rely on', 'laugh at', 'be proud of', 'be jealous of']","WhenYao Ming was young, other children in his class might  _  him because of his height.","It is very normal for people to compare themselves with others. Everyone does it, but it is important to remember that no one is perfect. Other people may look confident, but everyone feels insecure  once in a while, even the famous people like Yao Ming. When he was young, he probably felt insecure about being too tall! Other kids in his class probably laughed at him because he was different, although I don't know if I would have laughed at Yao Ming since he is so much bigger than me! Now, Yao Ming is rich and successful because of his height.
When I was young, I had a friend named Annie. Everyone used to call her ""toothpick"" because they thought she was too thin. Now, everyone is jealous  of her because she is thin and beautiful, and they have to always exercise to keep from getting fat. What makes you feel insecure and different may actually be a gift and help you in life. We should celebrate what makes us special and not be afraid to stand out in the crowd.",middle6135.txt
