2,A,"['Their islands used to be part of France.', 'Their islands are often visited by the French.', 'They came from France.', 'They speak French.']",Why do people on the Channel Islands follow French way of living?,"The Channel Islands are a group of British-owned islands lying in the English Channel 10 to 30 miles off the French coast, and 70 to 90 miles from the English coast. There are ten islands with a total land area of 75 square miles and a total population of 123,000. The three largest islands, Jersey, Guernsey, and Alderney, have long been known for the fine breeds of cattle that are raised on them and named after them. 
In earliest known history the islands were considered part of Normandy, which was part of France, but the ruler of Normandy became king of England in 1066, and from then on the islands were looked upon as British land. English control was unbroken until World War II, when the Germans held the islands for five years. 
Although people on the islands speak both languages and they are considered English, their customs are more French than English.",high23288.txt
