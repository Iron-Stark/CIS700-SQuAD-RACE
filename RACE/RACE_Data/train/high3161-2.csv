2,A,"[""Drinking heavily increases AIDS patients' illness."", ""Priests can cure many AIDS patients' illnesses."", 'Drug taking and heavily drinking can cure AIDS patients.', 'Team work and patience can cure AIDS patients.']",What can we learn from the above story?,"That summer I drank every day, everywhere I went. I had a bottle in my drawer next to me and a bottle next to my bed. I never did another drug, but I drank so much that my family finally asked a priest for help. My father gave me a bottle of medicine for alcoholism that produces unpleasant symptoms when users drink alcohol. I drank while taking it, which made me very sick. And I still drank.
When the priest came, he said, ""Jimmy, doctors said that with your diseases and the amount of drinking you're doing, _ . So your choice is either to stop drinking and live or to continue drinking and die within six months.""
I said, ""I know I can't stop, so guess I'll have to die."" The priest told my family what I said. My little brother-who is like my soul mate, looked at me with tears in his eyes and said, ""But we don't want you to die."" All I could think of was how desperately I had to get out of that room at that moment and have a drink.
But I finally stopped drinking. I was on the care team of my dentist Russell. A lot of people in New York knew him. At the time he was the most famous dentist in the city. He drank heavily and was also with AIDS, so I was selected to be on his care team. Everybody on the team was sober   but me. He went through dementia   and died so quickly before my eyes. I stopped drinking and I've been with the disease for 35 years now.",high3161.txt
