0,C,"['Some stories about nicknames for places.', 'Activities launched by two British organizations.', 'A survey of nicknames for places.', 'The attractiveness of place nicknames.']",What is the passage mainly about?,"Does your local town have a nickname? If so, what does it say about the area and the people who live there? Many cities are recognized across the world by  their unofficial names. New York is the Big Apple, London is the Big Smoke, and Los Angeles is famously called La La Land.
Now, as part of English Language Day on Wednesd ay, two British organizations, the English Project and Ordnance Survey, are launching    an interactive project which aims to identify the nicknames which people use in their daily lives for the places which they like or dislike.
""The name that people create for a place forms a connection with feelings,"" explains Winchester University's Professor Bill Lucas, a patron   of the English Project.
""So Basingstoke becomes Amazingstoke; Swindon is known as Swindump and Padstow, hometown of chef Rick Stein, is nicknamed Padstein.""
Basingstoke is a town in central England. The local nickname, Amazingstoke, shows the love that locals seem to have for the area. Swindon, on the other hand, is sometimes called Swindump, showing that some people think it's a dump ( ). Stanford Le Hope in Essex is  called Stanford No Hope by locals.
And Padstow in Cornwall is so closely connected with the local famous person Rick Stein that it's become known as Padstein.
Since launching the online survey last week, the creators have already received 3,000 alternative titles for places and landmarks.
As well as creating what promises to be a fascinating resource of nicknames, there is a practical side to the project. ""With the huge variety of place nicknames that exist, we could never hope to collect them all ourselves,"" says Glen Hart, Ordnance Survey's head of research. ""But the information from the project could prove vital. Organizations like the emergency services rely on our information when responding to 999 calls, so by having the most complete set of nicknames we could help the emergency services quickly locate the right place, and maybe even save lives.""",high19320.txt
