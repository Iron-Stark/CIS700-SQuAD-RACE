Table manners are about being kind to and considerate of others.Having proper table manners is one way people judge others,and we don't want people to think that we are rude,do we ?
Whether in a restaurant or in a home, here are some basic table manners for kids:
1Eat with a fork unless the food is meant to be eaten with fingers.Only babies eat with fingers.
2Sit up and do not hunch over your plate;wrists or forearms can rest on the table,or hands on lap.
3Chew with your mouth closed,No one wants to see food being chewed up.This includes no talking with your mouth full.
4Don't make any rude comments about any food being served.It will hurt someone's feelings.Always say thank you when you're served something.
5Eat slowly.It takes someone a long time to prepare the food,so enjoy it slowly.Wait about 5 seconds after swallowing to get another forkful . 
6 Don't reach over someone's plate for something.Politely ask the dish to be passed to you.
7When eating at someone's home or being a guest of someone at a restaurant,always thank the host and tell him or her how much you enjoy it.At least say that you like the dinner ,for example, the dessert is great.",high13019.txt
