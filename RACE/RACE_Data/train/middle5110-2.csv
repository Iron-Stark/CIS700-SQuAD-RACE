2,C,"['John Doe.', 'Jane Doe.', 'John Smith.', 'Jane Smith']","In UK, they can call unknown people   _  .","Have you ever had this moment: you are talking about name? Don't worry! In English, there are special names to replace their real names.
In the US, if you forget someone's name, you can simply say the name John Doe for a man, or Jane Doe for a woman. For example, 'Did you see that boy who was running in the rain?' 'Ah, yes, poor John Doe.'
Also, in US courts ( ), people also use these names. This is to keep the person' s identity  a secret. People use the name so often that there was even a comedy film in 1941 called Meet John Doe.
However in the UK, unknown people are called John Smith. This is because John is one of the most common first names in English. And Smith is the most common family name.
So next time you forget someone's name, you know who to say.",middle5110.txt
