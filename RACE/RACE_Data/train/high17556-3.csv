3,D,"['New fuels on the way', 'Cars or bicycles, that is a question', 'End of the good old days', 'From wheels to heels']",What is the best title for this passage?,"""Extra? Extra! Gasoline hits four dollars a gallon!""
                No one will really be shocked -- except, perhaps, the old-timers who tell about the good old days when gas was three gallons for a dollar, and people drove around ""just for the fun of it"".
As a matter of fact, the price of gas has been rising fast and steadily for several years, and many adjustments have already been made.
                 There was, for a time, considerable unemployment in the auto industry, and three quarters of the garages and service stations have gone out of business. However, the bicycle and motor-scooter business has flourished , and many people have found employment there.
Now that Federal Motors has brought out its new Lilliput, which travels forty miles on a gallon, the auto business is picking up again. The factories that haven't switched over to two-wheel transportation are working on their new smaller models.
There is talk, too, about bringing out new steam and electric automobiles that will be just as economical as the old cars.
In the meantime, streetcars are gradually replacing buses all over the country because of the greater economy of electric power. And many people who have seldom used public transportation are now riding the streetcars while their automobiles rust in their garages. There's no market at all for their big, luxurious cars, for only the wealthy can now afford to operate them. Many people are now shopping in their own neighborhood, and small businesses are thriving.
                 Ministers, educators, and editorial writers are pointing out that there has been a great improvement in family life. Families now stay at home more for their fun, and children and parents are becoming better acquainted. The stores report a booming business in parlor games, hobby materials, books, musical instruments and albums.
                 People have lost their pale indoor look. The revival of the lost art of walking has brought a healthy pink back to many a cheek. This return to the heels has revolutionized the clothing styles; people now need to be ready for all kinds of weather.
                 These conditions, however, may not last. Already our clever chemists are at work on new synthetic fuels which, they say, will put us right back where we were -- on wheels. Shall we wish them success or not?",high17556.txt
