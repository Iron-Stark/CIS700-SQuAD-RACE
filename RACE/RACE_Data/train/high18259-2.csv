2,B,"['They are not fully matured.', ""The passage doesn't mention the reason."", 'There is something wrong with their responsibility.', 'Their standards for a potential partner are too high.']",What is probably the reason for which young people fail to get married?,"As people in China celebrated Singles' Day on November 11, the media eagerly discussed why so many marriageable young people fail to find their other half.
              While single people in China are pitied, their counterparts in some Western countries feel they are being discriminated against. In the US, where more than a quarter of all households consists of one person, single people often pay more insurance than married people. They don't get the same tax breaks and they seldom get promoted at work.
              There seems to be a bad name attached to their status - somehow their personality is flawed
  and therefore they are not to be trusted.
              Activities have created the term ""singlism"" to describe discrimination against unmarried people. It means stereotyping , stigmatizing  and discrimination against those who are single.
              Globally, the number of people living alone is skyrocketing. Many people are at peace with being single and some even choose to remain single. But why are so many of us worried about singledom?
              Michael Cobb, professor of English at the University of Toronto in Canada, says that pop culture is to blame for people's fear of singledom. His book Single: Arguments for the Uncoupled is a critical examination of singleness in favor of the couple, making singletons one of the most despised  sexual minorities in Western countries. In pop culture, singles are viewed as immature, whereas fully adults are able to form relationships and live meaningful lives.
              The overall message is clear: go ahead and be yourself, but if you want real happiness, make sure you get coupled up. You may get that idea from US comedy series Sex and the City and the most recent Girls, or UK's Bridge Jones' Diary.",high18259.txt
