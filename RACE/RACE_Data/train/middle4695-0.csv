We're going by train to New York,and then take a ship to Europe.When we arrive in Europe,we're going to some countries for sightseeing .We'll go to places either by train or by bus.We're going to fly home.
It took us a long time to decide where to go,but I think we'll have a very interesting trip.We'll go to England,France and Italy.We also talked about how we would go to Europe.At first we wanted to fly because it would be faster and would save more time.But my brother likes to take a boat trip and the children like that,too.",middle4695.txt
