1,D,"['Stephen preferred to go into the Navy rather than the Army.', 'Stephen also received his call-up papers as Roy.', ""The father didn't like Stephen's idea of going to America."", 'Stephen was eventually forced to stay to run the estate.']",Which statement is NOT true according to the passage?,",A, B, CD,,. Roy wasn't the only one to receive his call-up papers.Stephen Napier's call-up came at the beginning of February and he was pleased to find that he would be going into the Royal Air Force (RAF).

""No, Father. You've got an estate to run. I never asked for it. Why not ask Baden to do this stuff? He perhaps can make a good job of it, but I...""
