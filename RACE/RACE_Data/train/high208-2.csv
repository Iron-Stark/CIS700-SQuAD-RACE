2,A,"['The teacher taught not only at UNLV but also at the community college.', ""That was the teacher's lucky day because the teacher liked walking."", 'The teacher always hoped that the car would break down often.', 'The young man was sad because his car broke down.']",Which one of the following is TRUE?,"At the beginning of my 8:00 a.m. class one Monday at UNLV , I cheerfully asked my students how their weekend had been. One young man said that his weekend had not been very good. The young man then proceeded to ask me why I always seemed to be so cheerful.
His question reminded me of something I'd read somewhere before: ""Every morning when you get up, you have a choice about how you want to approach life that day,"" I said to the young man. ""I choose to be cheerful.""
""Let me give you an example,"" I continued. ""In addition to teaching here at UNLV, I also teach out at the community college in Henderson. One day a few weeks ago I drove to Henderson. I exited the freeway and turned onto College Drive. But just then my car died. I tried to start it again, but the engine wouldn't _ . So I put my flashers on, grabbed my books, and marched down the road to the college.""
""As soon as I got there, the secretary in the Provost's office asked me what had happened. 'This is my lucky day', I replied, smiling.""
""Your car breaks down and today is your lucky day?"" She was puzzled, ""What do you mean?""
""I live seventeen miles from here. I replied. My car could have broken down anywhere along the freeway. It didn't. Instead, it broke down in the perfect place: off the freeway, within walking distance of here. I'm still able to teach my class, and I've been able to arrange for the tow truck to meet me after class. If my car was meant to break down today, it couldn't have been arranged in a more convenient fashion.""",high208.txt
