No-garbage lunches.How many lunch bags do you throw away after lunch? Environment clubs ask students to bring their lunches in bags that can be used again.Every week they will choose the classes that make the least garbage and report them to the whole school.
No-car day.On a no-car day, nobody comes to school in a car including the students and the teachers.Cars give pollution to us, so remember:
Walk, jump, bike, or run!
Use your legs! It's lots of fun!
