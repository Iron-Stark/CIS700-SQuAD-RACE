Years later, my life changed a lot. So one Christmas, I wanted to do something special. I asked forty friends to help me. We visited 125 orphans to come to our Christmas party. For every child, we prepared a beautiful gift.
Finally the moment came. I called out,"" One, two, three. Open your gifts!"" As the children opened their boxes, the whole room was full of their bright smiles. The feeling I got from that Christmas so long ago came again.",middle661.txt
