0,B,"['at the age of 19', 'at the age of 8', 'when he began to go to school.', ""We don't know""]",When did George Dennehy begin to learn play the cello?,"Although 19-year-old George Dennehy is armless, he isn't letting that stop him from pursuing  his dreams and sharing his passion   with the world.
Born without arms, the young boy's birth parents left him. Luckily, a warm-hearted couple _ him and took good care of him. However, his new parents never allowed him to use his disability as an excuse to be lazy. When George turned eight, they asked him to sign up  for cello  lessons. The instrument  is tough even for people who have the use of both their hands, so it was even more challenging for George, who had to learn to play it with his feet.
Thanks to his music teacher, the young boy not only mastered the cello, but also realized that he had a passion and talent for music. During middle school years, he also mastered the piano and guitar.
His music talent caught the eye of an American rock band who invited him to perform alongside them at a ten-day-long music festival.
The experience has inspired  this once shy boy to pursue a career  in music. He has also become a motivational   speaker who encourages both able and disabled people to pursue their dreams, no matter how impossible these dreams may sound.
