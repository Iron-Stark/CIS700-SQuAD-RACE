1,C,"['Each state joined the Union.', 'Each President was born.', 'Each President took office.', 'Each President died.']",In which order will the Presidential1 coins come out?,"Hundreds of people lined up at Grand Central Terminal yesterday, but they
weren't there to catch a train. They came to New York City's famous railroad station to trade in old dollar bills for the new George Washington Presidential1 coin.
The gold-colored coin is the first in a new series by the U.S. Mint that honors former U.S. Presidents. The Mint will issue  four Presidential1 coins a year through 2016. Like the popular 50 State Quarters program, which issues coins in the order in which each state joined the Union, Presidential1 coins will come out in the order in which each President served. The George Washington coin is the first to be released. John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison coins will come out later this year.
The Presidential 1 coins will be the same size and color as the Sacagawea Golden Dollar. However, there is an important difference. For the first time since the 1930s, there is an inscription on the edge of each coin. Each coin will show a different President on its face, or head side. It will also show the President's name, the order in which he served and his years in office. The other side of the coin will show the Statue of Liberty and the inscriptions ""United States of America"" and "" 1"".
There will be one Presidential1 coin for each President, except Grover Cleveland. He will have two! Cleveland is the only U.S. President to have served two nonconsecutive terms.
The last President scheduled to get a coin is Gerald Ford because a President must have been dead for two years before he can be on a coin.",high11438.txt
