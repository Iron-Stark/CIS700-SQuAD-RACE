There, a robotic nurse directs me onto a device and then takes my blood pressure. Some time later, in steps the doctor, who is also a robot. He notes down my symptoms and gives me a prescription  . I pay for my visit using a credit card machine and return home without having met another human being.
When I call my dentist's office and actually get a human being on the line, I am thrilled. And when I see the introduction of yet more self-service checkout stations at the grocery store, I feel like shouting, ""When it comes to cashiers, make mine human, please!""
After all, human cashiers sometimes give you a store coupon   for items you are buying. Even more than that, real-life cashiers often take an interest in particularly cute children, which can brighten a young mother's day.
