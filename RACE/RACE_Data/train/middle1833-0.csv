The larger of the two deserts the Uyuni salt desert ,is 12000 square kilometers .During the day ,the desert is bright white because of the salt .There are no roads across the Uyuni desert ,so local people must show guests the way to the hotel .
In the early 1900s ,a man named Juan Quesada built the hotel .He cut big blocks of salt from the desert and used the blocks to build it. Everything in the hotel is made out of salt ;the walls , the roof , the chairs , the tables ,the beds ,and the hotels bar .
The Sun heats the walls and the roof during the day . At night is very cold , but the rooms stay warm . The hotel has twelve rooms . A single room costs 40 dollars a night .and a double room costs 60 dollars .
A sign on the hotels wall tells guests ,Please do not lick the walls.",middle1833.txt
