It's 2:25 am. I can't sleep. There is something that I have to tell you. Our grandfather feels bad and gets very sick. He had a fever for the whole day yesterday. So, Aunt Ruby sent him to the hospital last night. Did your father tell you _ ? Mike and I planned to go to New Town to visit him this weekend. Do you want to go with us? Maybe we can cheer him up.
Grandpa took care of us when we were little. After grandma died, he spent lots of his time being with us. He helped our parents a lot.

Yours,
Kevin",middle5415.txt
