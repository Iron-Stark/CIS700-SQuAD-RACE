Every time he drove home at noon, he found many cars were parked outside his house and there was no room for his own car. He had to drive somewhere else to park his car. Then he had to walk back home. This made him very angry.
He had put up a board, which said, "" No parking"" in the garden facing the road, but nobody noticed it. People seemed to obey  only a police notice with letters on a blue board:
POLICE NOTICE
NO PARKING
Mrs. Brown suggested that he could steal a police notice. He was afraid to do so. She then suggested that he could make one just like a police notice. He said he was not the police and couldn't use the word ""police"". Several days later, Mr. Brown made a blue board with white letters:
POLITE NOTICE
NO PARKING
