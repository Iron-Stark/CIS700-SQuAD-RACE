2,D,"['water pollution and floods', 'the risk of failure of governments', 'the relation between water and agriculture', 'effects of water problems around the world']",This article mainly talks about   _  .,"A new American report says water-related problems will likely increase tensions  around the world in the next ten years. These problems include water shortages, poor water quality and floods. The problems will increase the risk of failure of governments. However, countries are unlikely to go to war over water. But the real question is that some governments may use water as a weapon to pressure others ten years later.
The report looks at possible effects of water problems on the United States national security interests over the next thirty years. It says the areas that will be most affected by water problems are North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. The United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says, ""Reliable water resources are essential for feeding the hungry, running industries and creating energy. Certainly they are central when we think about how climate changes will affect future generations.""
The report also predicts an increased demand for American assistance and expert help to solve those problems. That demand for help could create opportunities for leadership and influence.
Water shortages, poor water quality, and floods are unlikely to result in state failure. But these could combine with poverty, social tensions, environmental problems, poor leadership and weak governments to produce social disorder. And that combination could cause state failure.
The report predicts that from now through 2040 water shortages and pollution probably will harm the economic performance of important trading partners. During the next ten years the loss of groundwater supplies in some agricultural areas will create a risk to national and global food markets. These shortages will be a result of poor management.
Agriculture uses about seventy percent of the world's freshwater. The report says technology that reduces the amount of water needed to grow crops will offer the best way to fight against water shortages.",high22747.txt
