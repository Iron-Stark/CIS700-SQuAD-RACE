2,D,"['music', 'English', 'chess', 'art']",Lucy is in the   _   club.,"My name is Lucy. I come from America. I am now in China.  I study in Hangzhou Shulan Middle School. There are many clubs in our school. They are an English club, an art club, a music club, a ball game club, a swimming club, a chess club and a computer club. There is a ""Show Yourselves !"" Festival in our school every year. On that day, students from different clubs show their talents in different ways. They can sing English songs, draw and paint beautiful pictures. They can play the guitar, the violin, the piano, and the trumpets. They can also play chess and show us their swimming skills. They like the festival very much.  I join the art club, and I paint the ads  for them . Giving  help makes me happy.",middle2621.txt
