2,A,"['Wise.', 'Mean.', 'Generous.', 'Stupid.']",What do you think of the Masai ?,"At the beginning of the 20th century there were more than a million lions worldwide. Today there are less than 30,000 in the wild. The remaining lions are increasingly threatened by habitat loss, hunting and activities to protect farms and cattle.
For generations, Masai tribesmen on the large African plains in southeastern Kenya have hunted lions -- to protect their farms and cattle. Today they celebrate the lions' life.
Noah is an elder in the Masai community. ""We have decided as a community of the Masai to lay down our spears, and there will be no more killing of lions in our community."" He is part of a group of Masai visiting the United States promoting   the Predator Compensation Program.
Conservation International's Frank Hawkins explains, ""The Masai have been living with wildlife for many generations and it has been a conflicting ( ) relationship in many ways. They compete with the animals for food as lions eat their cattle. We're trying to find ways in which the wildlife will become something useful to them."" They had the Predator Compensation Fund founded in 2003. After much discussion, a group of Masai farmers agreed to protect lions. In turn, if lions or other predators kill their cattle, the Masai owner will be paid market value for the dead animals from the fund.
One man said that in the past, when a lion killed cattle, they killed it immediately. And now, after the start of the program, the Masai see the lion population growing. Since 2003, only four lions have been killed here.",high3980.txt
