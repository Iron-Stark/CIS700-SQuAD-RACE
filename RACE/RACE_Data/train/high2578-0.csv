0,A,"['There was no girl character in the game.', 'The characters were not real at all.', 'No girls would like to play the game.', 'It was not like playing real hockey games.']",What bothered Peters when playing NHL games?,"Lexi Peters, a 14-year-old girl in New York, loves hockey. She's not only good at playing on her after-school team, but also at playing hockey video games. But when Peters played the popular NHL (National Hockey League) games made by Electronic Arts, something really bothered her. The virtual   character in the game could only be a boy -- not a girl.
She didn't think that was reasonable. There must be many girls playing hockey in the US. So she wrote a letter to Electronic Arts.
""Being represented by a man is unfair to women and girl hockey players,"" Peters wrote. ""Women's hockey is a fast-growing sport. I am confident that I'm not the only woman interested in the opportunity to create herself in the game.""
Several weeks later, Peters received an unexpected e-mail from the senior producer for EA Sports' NHL games, David Littman. ""Hi, Lexi,"" the e-mail began. ""We agree with you!""
Electronic Arts said it would create a female player in the game. ""I was thinking you could be the model,"" Littman wrote. Peters almost couldn't believe it. Later, she sent photos of herself taken at all different angles  .
And so, when Electronic Arts released the newest version of their game, NHL 12, this fall, Peters was the face of the female player. She can now skate with the NHL's great players. ""It's strange at first, but you get used to it,"" said Peters. ""It's really funny and cool.""
For Peters, there is also an important lesson that she will take with her the rest of her life. ""If you have something to say, and you think it's important, go for it!"" she said.",high2578.txt
