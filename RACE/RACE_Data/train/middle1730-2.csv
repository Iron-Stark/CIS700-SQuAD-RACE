There are some tips about how to choose a right partner on the Internet:
Unluckily, you can't ask a person if he has a good feeling. If you ask, everyone will tell you that they do! It is important that you have to get to know your travel partner to find out what kind of feeling he really has.

What's more? Always keep in contact with  your travelling partner when travelling. Don't simply hang out without telling them, and don't let them do it to you, either.",middle1730.txt
