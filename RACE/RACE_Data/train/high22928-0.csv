0,C,"['Tolerant.', 'Conservative.', 'Positive.', 'Doubtful.']",What's Dr Flatley's attitude towards the technology?,"Every baby born a decade from now will have its genetic code   mapped at birth, the head of the worlds' leading genome sequencing   company has predicted.
A complete DNA read - out for every newborn will be technically possible and affordable in less than five years, promising a revolution in healthcare, says Jay Flatley, the chief executive of Illumina. Only social and legal problems are likely to delay the age of ""genome sequences,"" or genetic profiles. By 2019 it will have become routine to map infants' genes when they are born, Dr Flatly told The Times.
This will open a new approach to medicine, by which conditions such as high blood pressure and heart disease can be predicted and prevented and drugs used more safely and effectively.
A baby's genome can be discovered at birth by a blood test. By examining a person's genome, it is possible to identify raised risks of developing diseases such as cancers. Those at high risk can then be screened more regularly, or given drugs or dietary advice to lower their chances of becoming ill. 
Personal genomes could also be used to ensure that patients get the medicine that is most likely to work for them and least likely to have side-effects.
The development, however, will raise legal concerns about privacy and access to individuals' genetic records.
""Bad things can be done with the genome. It could predict something about someone - and you could possibly hand the information to their employer or their insurance company."" said Dr Flatley.
""People have to recognize that  _ , and that your genome probably can't be protected, because everywhere you go you leave your genome behind. Complete genetic privacy, however, is unlikely to be possible"", he added.
As the benefits become clearer, however, he believes that most people will want their genomes read and interpreted. The risk is nothing compared with the gain.",high22928.txt
