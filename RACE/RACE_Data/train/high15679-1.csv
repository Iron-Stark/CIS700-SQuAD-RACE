1,B,"['are helpful to others', 'can be free to express themselves', 'earn much money', 'are considered respectable']",Steve Denning thinks that being an author is happy mainly because authors   _   .,"What kind of job do you want to do in the future ? One that earns the most money or one that gives you the highest social position? What about a job that makes you feel happy? Surprisingly, these three things do not always go together in the job world .
According to a general social survey by the National Organization for Research at the University of Chicago in the US, the ten happiest jobs are not those with better pay or higher social position. They are ordinary jobs.
But what is it that makes a ""happy"" job?
Researchers found that people are happier when they feel they are doing something worthwhile. Six of the top ten happiest jobs are based heavily on helping others, such as firefighters, teachers, and physical therapists( ).
Being able to express oneself is also important for people to feel satisfied . Take authors as an example. Their pay is ""ridiculously low or non-existent"", but ""the freedom of writing down the contents of your own mind leads to happiness ,""wrote business author Steve Denning on his blog on Forbes.com.
These jobs are greatly different to the top ten ""hated jobs"", according a website survey earlier this year. Director of information technology, sales manager, technical specialist and others that are generally considered respectable jobs are on the list.
Todd May from The New York Times didn't find the results strange. He argued that
"" a meaningful life must, in some sense then , make people feel worthwhile"". If a person doesn't participate in the causes "" that are generally regarded as worthy, like feeding and clothing the poor, their life will lack meaning ,""he said . Work takes up the greater part of most people's  lives . It's no wonder that the people with the most worthwhile jobs are the happiest of all.
However, it's important to remember that these two surveys are broad ones and that it doesn't matter whether your dream job is on the two lists. Now it is the time to think about the future . After all, something that satisfies your mind will always bring you happiness.",high15679.txt
