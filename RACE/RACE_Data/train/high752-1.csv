1,D,"['Because he was too young.', ""Because he didn't get a college education."", 'Because he was not a good-looking person.', ""Because he hadn't got enough experience.""]",Why didn't the writer get the job in Chicago?,"""Everything happens for the best,"" my mother said whenever I was disappointed. ""Don't worry. One day your luck will change.""
I didn't pay attention to her words. After finishing my college education, I decided to look for a job in a radio station. I wanted to host a sports programme. I went to Chicago and knocked on the door of every station. ButI got turned down every time.
In one station, a kind lady said to me that I hadn't got enough experience. ""Get to a small station and work for some time,"" she said.
When I went back home, my dad told me that a businessman had opened a store and needed someone to help him. But again, I didn't get the job.
I felt really down. ""Your luck will change,"" Mum said to me. Later, I tried another radio station in Iowa. But the owner, a nice man, told me he had already had someone to work for him. As I left his office, I asked, ""How can someone be a sportsannouncer  if he can't get a job in a radio station?""
I was waiting for the lift when I heard the man call, ""What did you mean? Do you know anything about football?"" He let me sit in front of a microphone and asked me to try to imagine that I was giving my opinion on a football game, and finally I succeeded.
On my way home, Mum's words came back to me, ""One day your luck will change, Son.""",high752.txt
