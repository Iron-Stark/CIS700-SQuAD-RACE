3,C,"[""Jack doesn't like his job at all."", 'Jack usually goes home before 2 a.m.', 'The young lady lost her key.', 'The young lady called the police.']",What can we learn from the passage?,"My friend Jack is a taxi driver. He has done this job for ten years. It's a nice job most of the time. He can meet a lot of people every day. He always works late into the night because there are lots of people calling his taxi during the night. He usually goes home after two o'clock in the morning. There are some very strange things, which often happen at night.
One day Jack was taking a young lady back home from a party at three o'clock in the morning. She had her little dog with her. When they got to her house, she found that she had lost her key. So Jack waited in the taxi with the dog while she climbed into her house through the window. Jack waited for about half an hour outside, but the young lady didn't show up . So he decided to find out what was going on. He tied the dog to a tree and started to climb in through the window.
At that moment some policeman came. They thought Jack was a thief  who wanted to get into the house to steal  things. Luckily, the young lady came downstairs. She must have gone to sleep and forgotten about my friend and the dog.",middle6384.txt
