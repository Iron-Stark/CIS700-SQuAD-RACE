3,D,"['to produce it himself', 'to prevent it being produced', 'to be paid not to produce it', 'the manager to produce it']",Johnson showed his new oil to the manager because he wanted   _  .,"When Johnson called again, the manager received him very politely. ""That is a most remarkable oil you brought us, Mr Johnson,"" he said. Johnson nodded his smooth, dark head. That was something he knew very well. ""I've never seen anything like it,"" the manager admitted. Johnson nodded again. ""No?"" he said politely. Then he added, ""But I think you will, sir. A very great deal of it."" He appeared to think for a moment. ""I think you will find it will be on sale seven, perhaps, eight years from now."" He smiled.
The manager thought that was uncertain. He said, ""It is better than our fish oils. I admit that."" ""So I am told, sir,"" agreed Johnson.
""Have you any plans to produce it yourself, Mr Johnson?""
Johnson smiled again. ""Would I be showing it to you if I had?""
""We might add some chemicals to one of our own fish oils,"" said the manager.
""It would be expensive to do that, even if you could."" Johnson said gently. ""Besides,"" he added, ""I am told that this oil will be much cheaper than your best fish oils. Cheaper than any vegetable oil, in fact.""
""Perhaps,"" said the manager. ""Well, I suppose you want to make an arrangement, Mr Johnson, Shall we discuss it?""
""Of course,"" said Johnson. ""There are two ways of dealing with a situation of this sort. The usual one is to prevent it altogether or at least to delay it as long as possible. That is, of course, the best way,"" The manager nodded. He knew plenty about all that.
""But I am so sorry for you, because, you see, that is not possible this time."" The manager had his doubts, but all he said was an inquiring(asking), ""Oh?""
""The other way,"" continued Johnson, ""is to produce yourself before the trouble starts.""",high7390.txt
