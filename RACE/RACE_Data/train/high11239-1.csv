1,C,"['Bitter but easy.', 'Comfortable and happy.', 'Hard but warm.', 'Well-off and relaxing.']",Which of the following can best describe their present life?,"We thought we had it all---a beautiful house, three healthy children and one more on the way, two cars, a couple of four-wheelers for entertainment---and we loved it. Then, the market turned and my husband's job at a construction company was gone. The company was closing down for good.We both started looking for jobs right away, but there weren't any to be found. With each passing day we were getting increasingly worried and we continued to work together in order to pull our family through. _ I felt feelings of admiration for my husband that I hadn't felt in years.
That's why it was so hard for me to watch him blame himself for our present situation. I continually asked him to stop, but he seemed to want to punish himself for not having a job.
Finally, one afternoon I pulled him aside and said, ""We have four healthy children and each other. That's what's important. That makes you a rich man.""
"" But what if we lose the house? They'll hate me--you'll hate me,"" he replied.
I smiled at him and put my hands on both sides of his face to make him look me in the eye. ""No matter where we live I will be happy -as long as I have you."" I smiled again. In all the struggling together I had found that deep love for him that I had on the day we said ""I do"".
I could see his shoulders and neck relaxed. He held me close and we were able to talk and plan and dream together in a way that we hadn't for quite some time. It was a turning point for us as a couple and a family.
We are still struggling for out better life, but I consider us well-off because we have something that money can't buy and no one can take away from us.",high11239.txt
