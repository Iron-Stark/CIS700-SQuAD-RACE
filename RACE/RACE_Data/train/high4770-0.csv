Yes, we may only do a little bit, but together our small actions add up to a lot.
1. Protect wildlife habitat.
Perhaps the greatest threat that faces many species is the widespread destruction of habitat. Cutting down forests, farming, and development all result in loss of wildlife habitat. In areas where rare species live, habitat destruction can quickly force a species to extinction. By protecting habitat, entire communities of animals can be protected together naturally. _ 
2. Reduce the threat of invasive   species.
The spread of non-native species has greatly reduced native populations around the world. Invasive species compete with native species for resources   and habitat. They can even _ native species directly, forcing native species towards extinction.
3. Place decals   on windows.
It is reported that as many as one billion birds in the United States die each year because of collisions   with windows. You can help reduce the number of collisions simply by placing decals on the windows in your home and office.
4. Slow down when driving.
Many native animals have to live in developed areas and this means they must move in human-living areas. One of the biggest obstacles   to them is that created by roads. Roads divide habitat and present a constant risk to any animal attempting to cross from one side to the other. So when you're out and about, slow down and keep an eye out for wildlife.",high4770.txt
