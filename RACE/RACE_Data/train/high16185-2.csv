2,C,"[""didn't say anything"", ""knew the horse wasn't blind at all"", 'thought the horse was really blind', 'said he had stolen the horse']","When Washington asked the neighbor to tell them in which eye the horse was blind, the neighbor    _   .","Once a neighbour stole one of Washington's horses. Washington went with a police officer to the neighbour's farm to get the horse, but the neighbour refused to give the horse up; he claimed   that it was his horse.
Washington placed both of his hands over the eyes of the horse and said to the neighbour, ""If this is your horse, then you must tell us in which eyes he is blind.""
""In the right eye,"" the neighbour said.
Washington took his hand from the right eye of the horse and showed the police officer that the horse was not blind in the right eye.
""Oh, I have made a mistake,"" said the neighbor. ""He is blind in the left eye.""
Washington then showed that the horse was not blind in the left eye, either.
""I have made another mistake,"" said the neighbor.
""Yes,"" said the police officer, ""and you have also proved that the horse does not belong to you. You must return it to Mr. Washington.""",high16185.txt
