1,A,"['Football', 'Volleyball', 'Basketball', 'Baseball']",_  is Zhang Ning's favourite sport.,"Dear Mum,
I don't think you understand my life. You think I should be studying all the time. I know you want me to find a good job when I grow up, but I would like to have a wonderful time, too. You never think about fun things for me to do like music, sports. Two days ago, when I was watching a football game on TV, you asked me to stop and do my homework. After finishing my homework, still I wasn't allowed  to read my football magazines. You said I had to go to bed early. That was bad enough, but yesterday was the worst day. I bought some computer games, and put them in my bag so that you wouldn't see them. I told you I had to do my homework first. I know it was wrong to lie  to you, but you told me that Dad would talk to me later. Mum, I didn't quite like what you did to me! I really love you, mum, but I wish you could try not to be so hard on me.
Love,
Zhang  Ning",middle4861.txt
