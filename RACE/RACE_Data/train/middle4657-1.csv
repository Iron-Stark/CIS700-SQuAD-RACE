In some restaurants it is difficult to get vegetarian food.Last Sunday, I went to Steve's Steakhouse with my friends.They all wanted to eat roast beef. I looked for vegetarian food,but
every dish had meat in it.I asked the waiter;""Can you give me something with no meat?""He asked,""Would you like some fish?""""No,thanks,""1 said.""I only want vegetables--no meat,and no fish.""""But this is a steakhouse.""said the waiter.""People come here because they want to eat meat!""
So we didn't eat in Steve's Steakhouse.We went to an Italian restaurant.My friends had meat pizzas(yuck!),and Ihad a big salad.",middle4657.txt
