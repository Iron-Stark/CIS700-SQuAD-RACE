These are the greatest Paralympic Games ever.

It was another spectacular show. Perhaps it's not quite as sublimely  beautiful as the opening, but a fitting end to what has been a memorable 12 days in the Chinese capital.
The Paralympics were inspiring. Not only the Paralympians themselves, but also the warmth of people in Beijing and the sense of self-respect among the disabled in China that these Games seem to have inspired, as well as a new attitude in general from the government and form Chinese society as a whole.

It doesn't get any better for disabled persons living in Beijingthan September 2008, with increased access for them in public areas.
But there are still problems. Some taxi drivers are not willing to pick up wheelchair users. Some companies deliberately break employment laws that ask them to employ a percentage of disabled persons. Many schools haven't opened their door to disabled students.
During the past Paralympics, Chinese society has witnessed firsthand the abilities of disabled persons in sporting. And the next step will be for the abilities of disabled people on the Paralympics to be translated into a realization of their abilities to study, work and go about daily life in a barrier-free society.
