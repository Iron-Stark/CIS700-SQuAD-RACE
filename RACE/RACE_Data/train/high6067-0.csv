Katharine Collins, a second-year college student
The course has been very interesting, but I was expecting a little more one-to-one time with my teacher.
We do about four assignments   each term, each of which is about 3,000 words.However, sometimes they are not that helpful.We hope to be given the right to write feedback   after every assignment, but we had no feedback at all throughout the first year.We are given grades about three weeks after we hand the assignments in.There is no feedback on where we have gone wrong or how we might improve.
Lee Millington, a creative-writing student
I choose the courses because of its reputation.There is a lack of one-to-one teaching.I would like personalized feedback from an expert in my field of writing.Some of the lectures have been quite helpful but they try to use too many different styles of writing.For example, if you want to be a poet, you might find that the lectures focus too much on novels.
I think there is too much attention paid to sharing our work in workshops and giving each other feedback.I think there should be more time given to actual teaching, rather than to feedback from people who are at a similar level to me.
Reporters from Hounsdown Secondary School, Ella, 16
When I work independently, I feel I have more freedom to develop my ideas and come up with more original viewpoints.The price of university will still be worth it to get the qualifications  necessary for better jobs.
Tyier, 16
Although the cost of university is very high now, I think university is required for gaining a good and well-paid job.
