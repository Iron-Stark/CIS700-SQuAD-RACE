3,B,"['describe a journey to Egypt to the tourists', 'offer some practical tips on traveling in Egypt', 'warn readers of the awful insects in Egypt', 'appeal to more possible tourists to the journey']",The purpose of this passage is to_.,"Most of the guests who come on our trips have never been to Egypt before .We want to make everyone comfortable and at ease, but we do always get the same questions in advance of trip. So here I will give you some travel tips.
              What should I wear?
              If you're lucky enough to visit Egypt between November and February, pack a sweater. You'll need it----the desert gets rather cold at night. During the day, the temperature will be agreeable and comfortable. Any other time, pack as if you're going to Phoenix of Vegas in August. For the ladies, bathing suits are normal if there's a pool where you are going, but leave the string bikini at home -it is a Muslim country, after all. Last, if you are planning on visiting any mosques or certain parts of upper Egypt, ladies will need to plan on bringing something that comes at least to the elbow , and no shorts for men or women in those areas.
              What special things do I need to pack?
              One of my favorite things in the world to bring to Egypt is an Evian Mister, a sprayer with a fine mist of Evian water. You may be able to find it in your local drug store. Spray a little on your face or head , and your body temperature will feel like it's dropped 10 or 15 degrees. Other items include your camera, sun block and extra batteries.
              How do I communicate with home?
              Internet cafes are plentiful everywhere, especially in Cairo, Luxor, and Alexandria. If you have international calling on you phone, you should be able to use it-AT&T and Sprint both work internationally for sure, but make sure you have the international coverage. A satellite phone is best if you are certain to need coverage in the middle of the country, like while sailing up the Nile , but for most people these days a cell phone is fine.
              What medical preparation do I need?
              In a word: none! The one thing you may come down with in Egypt is politely called ""Pharoah 's Revenge. "" The thing that gets rid of pharoah's Revenge is a regionally produced medicine, and is available at every drugstore for $1 a box . DON'T              drink local water. DO drink bottled water, avoid the skins of fresh vegetables, and you'll be fine.",high18277.txt
