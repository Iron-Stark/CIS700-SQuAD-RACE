He feels bored every day and he thinks he is growing older quickly. When he watches TV, he has to turn it up. But this often disturbs his neighbors. So he decides to buy a hearing aid. As he is a _ man, he doesn't want to pay much money for a hearing aid.
One day, he went to a clinic  and asked the clerk, ""How much do these hearing aids cost?""
""That depends,"" said the clerk. ""They cost from 2.00 dollars to 2 000 dollars.""
""Let me see the $2.00 model,"" he said.
The clerk put the device  around Mr Baker's neck. ""You just put this button in your ear and run this little string  down to your pocket,"" he explained.
