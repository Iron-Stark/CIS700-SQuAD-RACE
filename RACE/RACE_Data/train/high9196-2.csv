That is the conclusion of engineers from the US space agency and aeronautical firms, who _ future commuters traveling by ""skycar"".
These could look much like the concept skycar shown in the picture, designed by Boeing research and development. However, such vehicles could be some 25 years from appearing on the market. Efforts to build flying vehicles in the past have not been very successful. Such vehicles would not only be expensive and require the skills of a trained pilot to fly, but there are significant engineering challenges involved in developing them. ""When you try to combine them you get the worst of both worlds: a very heavy, slow, expensive vehicle that's hard to use,"" said Mark Moore, head of the personal air vehicle(PAV) division of the vehicle systems program at Nasa's Langley Research Center in Hampton, US. But Boeing is also considering how to police the airways and prevent total pandemonium -if thousands of flying cars enter the skies.
""The neat, gee-whiz part is thinking about what the vehicle itself would look like,"" said Dick Paul, a vice president with Phantom Works, Boeing's research and development arm. ""But we're trying to think through all the consequences of what it would take to deploy  a fleet of these.""
Past proposals to solve this problem have included artificial intelligence systems to prevent collisions between air traffic. Nasa is working on flying vehicles with the initial goal of transforming small plane travel. Small planes are generally costly, loud, and require months of training and lots of money to operate, making flying to work impractical for most people. But within five years, Nasa researchers hope to develop technology for a small plane that can fly out of regional airports, costs less than $100,000(PS55,725), is as quiet as a motorcycle and as simple to operate as a car.
Although it would not have any road-driving capabilities, it would bring this form of travel within the grasp of a wider section of people. The new technology would automate many of the pilot's functions. This Small Aircraft Transportation System(Sats) would divert pressure away from the ""hub-and-spoke "" model of air travel. Hub-and-spoke refers to the typically US model of passengers being processed through large ""hub"" airports and then on to secondary flights to ""spoke"" airports near their final destinations.",high9196.txt
