1,D,"[""I went to my friend's house to watch TV."", 'I stayed at home all day.', 'I asked my father to buy a new television.', 'I did many useful things.']",What did I do after the TV was missing?,"I will probably remember one June day seven years ago for the rest of my life. My father had been complaining that my brother and I were watching too much TV, but we ignored him. Then one day we came home and the television was gone.
When I asked my father about the missing TV, he said watching television was a waste of time. Without it, we would have time for other things.
I decided he was wrong. Is there life without TV? How can we spend the week without all those shows and soaps? I was sure my life would be boring without TV, I used my best debating skills to argue with him, but he would not give in.
However, I found other ways to spend my time finally, Each day I ran around the street. This reminded me of my love for athletics, which I still enjoy. I joined Volunteers, and I built lasting friendships. Most importantly, I discovered an artistic world I never knew. I started taking art contests, and was shocked when I won. Then I took piano lessons. I began to like listening to AM radio, reading news magazines.
Living without TV has taught me how to manage my time, so that I can do many things in one day. I am proud to have learned I don't need television.
Looking back, I think my father did the right thing. ""You are smart. You could do anything that you put your heart to."" he used to say. He believed in us. His actions showed me a much more colorful side of life without TV and the value of having a goal and sticking to it.",high1041.txt
