0,B,"['Driving much faster than the speed limit.', 'Drinking and driving', 'Moving into a parking space where another car is trying to park.', 'Changing lanes very suddenly and blocking another car.']",Which of the following statements does NOT describe aggressive     driving?,"At times we all get angry when we are driving. It might be because we are stuck in a traffic jam or stuck behind a very slow driver. It might be because we think another driver has done something very stupid and dangerous. Whatever the reason, it seems that getting angry in a car is something which happens more and more often and there is now a special term for it ""road rage"". Some experts even think that road rage is a kind of mental illness! How can we recognize this ""illness"" of road rage?
There are two kinds of road rage: aggressive driving and aggressive reactions to the way other people are driving. Aggressive driving can take different forms:
*Driving much faster than the speed limit.
*Increasing your speed very quickly.
*Driving very close behind the car in front and sounding the horn or flashing the headlights.
*Changing lanes very suddenly and blocking another car.
*Moving into a parking space where another car is trying to park.
There are also different reactions to the way other people are driving. These include:
*Making rude signs at people.
*Shouting at people and threatening them.
*Deliberately driving into another person's car.
*Hitting somebody.
*Using a weapon such as a baseball bat, or even a gun or a knife.
Road rage is certainly not a joke. There have been incidents of road rage which have led to serious injuries and even murder.
Experts think that one reason for road rage is that films show a lot of examples of fast and aggressive driving such as car chases where this kind of driving seems to be positive.
Experts also think that the punishments for dangerous driving are not serious enough.
Experience shows that driving problems can be controlled, but it takes a long time. In the UK in the last 30 years, the police have been quite successful in reducing the number of people who drink and drive. They are now working to stop people using mobile phones when they are driving. Let's hope they can have the same success with the road rage.",high965.txt
