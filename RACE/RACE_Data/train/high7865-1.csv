1,A,"['He brings happiness to the children.', 'He is better than the other two dogs.', 'He loves to play with children rather than adults.', 'He is lonely since the children have left home.']",What does the writer think about the third dog she owns?,"Years ago, I owned the very best dog in the world. I was a child when we got her. She grew up with me, and was always there when I needed her. She died during one of my college vacations. My heart broke then, and I knew that there would never be another dog like her.
However, I was wrong. My next dog came into my life when I was married. My husband traveled for a living. and I was often lonely. This dog taught me to be patient. He always stayed at my side until the children were born, and then he became their guardian , too. When he passed away, my heart broke. I was sure I would never love another dog as much as I loved him.
I was wrong again. We got the next one when the children were little. When he played with the children, he made them laugh. These days he spends more time with me since the children aren't around so much. He is, of course, the very best dog in the world.
I wonder if that's part of the lesson: To teach us that love has a spirit that returns again and again and never really dies.
It's amazing. _ And they fit into our families, our lives, and our hearts-- because they always have been and will be the best dogs in the world.",high7865.txt
