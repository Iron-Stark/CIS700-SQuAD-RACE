We invite special people to celebrate it with us.
The Presents
Presents are opened as soon as the children are awake. They can't wait for the birthday cake later in the day!
The Cards
Friends and family send birthday cards. Sending birthday cards is a custom   that began in England about 100 years ago.
The Party
The birthday child will have a party to which friends and family are invited. Visitors to the party bring presents for the birthday child. The children play games such as musical chairs and pass the parcel  .
The Cake
The birthday cake is decorated on a theme  . A candle for each year is lit and placed on top and the child blows out the candles making a wish. We don't put objects inside the cake as stated on many websites.
The Bumps  
It used to be traditional for the birthday child to have the bumps. Friends would hold the child by the legs and under the arms and lift the child up and down bumping them gently on the ground. The number of bumps given is the age of the child plus one for extra good luck. As this can be dangerous, clapping   is often done instead.
The Sweets
Some children do take sweets to school to share with their classmates on their birthdays.",high7045.txt
