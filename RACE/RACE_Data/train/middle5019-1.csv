1,D,"['Many hands make light work.', 'Actions speak louder than words.', ""Don't put all your eggs in one basket."", 'Being kind to someone is never a waste.']",What can we learn from the passage?,"Scene 1
On a wild mountain, two goats met on a rock just over a high cliff  . The rock was so narrow that there was neither room for them to pass each other nor to turn round and go back.
One of them with great care laid himself down on the narrow rock, pressing as close to the rock as he could. Then the other goat gently and softly stepped over his friend, till, safely past him, he could lightly get away.
The goat that had lain down then drew himself up, safe and free to leap again from rock to rock, and eat the sweet grass on the hills.
Scene 2
Two other goats met on the banks of a wild, rushing stream. They found there was a tree across the stream. It formed a bridge from one side to the other.
They stood for a moment with one foot on the tree, each thinking that the other would draw back. But neither of them would give away, and they met at last on the middle of the narrow bridge!
They then began to push and fight with their horns  , till at last their feet slipped, and both the goats fell into the stream, and were lost in the waters!
Both might have been saved if either of them had known how to give way to another at the right time.",middle5019.txt
