2,D,"['a student career guide', ""a researcher on students' problems"", ""a specialist in students' studies"", 'a maths teacher']",This text is most probably written by   _  .,"American middle school students don't seem to care that they're worse at maths than their counterparts   in China's Hong Kong and Finland. ""I don't need it,"" my student says, ""I'm going to be a basketball star."" Or a car mechanic, or a singer.
Middle school students' maths skills were tested by the International Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The United States ranked 28th out of 41 countries tested. After all, when was the last time you used algebra  ?
But maths isn't just about training Americans to become scientists. It has its own value. It helps you see patterns and develops your logic skills, and it teaches you to concentrate and to separate truth from falsehood. Maths helps you make wise financial decisions, so you can avoid false claims from advertisers, politicians and others. It helps you determine risk. For example, after an airplane crash, studies show that people are more likely to drive than to take a plane in spite of the fact that they are much more likely to be killed or injured while driving. Planes are not like criminals who repeat the same crime over and over. One plane is not more likely to crash just because another plane recently did. In fact, the most dangerous time to drive is probably right after a plane crash because so many people are on the road.
It is not possible to really understand science and the scientific method without understanding maths. A rainbow is even more beautiful and amazing when we understand it.
The precision   of maths helps us think in a very special way. How do we bring the learning of maths back to life? I don't have the big answer. I try my best to help pupils find answers to some maths problems. When I can get one to say, ""Wow, that's great,"" I feel the joy of a small victory.",high15118.txt
