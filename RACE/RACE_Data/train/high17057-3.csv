Obviously, they were there to file a divorce. Lawyer was very puzzled, after having a chat with them, he got their story.
This couple had been quarreling all their 40 over years of marriage nothing ever seemed to go right. They hang on because of their children, afraid that it might affect their up-bringing. Now, all their children have already grown up, have their own family, there's nothing else the old couple have to worry about, all they want is to lead their own life free from all these years of unhappiness from their marriage, so both agree on a divorce.
While they were signing the papers, the wife told the husband. "" really love you, but I really can't carry on anymore, I'm sorry.""
""It's OK, I understand."" said the husband. Looking at this, the lawyer suggested a dinner together, just three of them, wife thought, why not, since they are still going to be friends.
At the dining table, there was a silence of awkwardness .
The first dish was roasted chicken, immediately, the old man took the drumstick  for the old lady. ""Take this, it's your favorite.""
Looking at this, the lawyer thought maybe there's still a chance, but the wife was frowning when she answered. ""This is always the problem, you always think so highly of yourself, never thought about how I feel, don't you know that I hate drumsticks?""
Little did she know that, over the years, the husband had been trying all ways to please her, little did she know that drumsticks were the husband's favorite.
Little did he know that she never thought he understood her at all, little did he know that she hated drumsticks even though all he wanted was the best for her.
That night, both of them couldn't sleep, toss and turn , toss and turn. After hours, the old man couldn't take it anymore, he knows that he still loves her, and he can't carry on life without her, he wants her back, he wants to tell her, he is sorry, he wants to tell her, ""I love you.""
He picks up the phone, started dialing her number. Ringing never stops. He never stop dialing.
Little did she remember, he had heart problems.
The next day, she received news that he had passed away. She rushed down to his apartment, saw his body, lying on the couch still holding on to the phone. He had a heart attack when he was still trying to get through her phone line.
As sad as she could be, She would have to clear his belongings and she saw this insurance policy, dated from the day they got married, beneficiary  is her. Together in that file there's this note:
""To my dearest wife, by the time you are reading this, I'm sure I'm no longer around, I bought this policy for you, though the amount is only $1,000,000 I hope it will be able to help me continue my promise that I have made when we got married, I might not be around anymore, I want this amount of money to continue taking care of you, just like the way I will if I could have lived longer. I want you to know I will always be around, by your side. I love you.""",high17057.txt
