""How much is an ice cream sundae?""
""Fifty cents,"" said the waitress.
The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied a number of coins in it. ""How much is a dish of plain ice cream?"" he asked.
Some people were waiting for a table, and the waitress was not patient. ""Thirty-five cents,"" she said angrily.
The little boy again counted the coins. ""I will have the plain ice cream,"" he said. The waitress brought the ice cream and walked away. The boy finished, paid the money, and left.
