1,B,"['do housework for humans', 'keep working after being damaged', 'remember a lot of information', 'tell people where it is']",The new technology allows the robot to  _  .,"In some science fiction movies, evil robots refuse to die, no matter how hard people fight back.
Now science fiction has become science fact. For the first time, scientists have made a robot that can take a beating  and keep on going. Scientists from Cornell University made the robot, which looks like a spider with four legs.
Until now, even the most advanced  robot was almost certain to break down when it was damaged . That is because its computer inside simply doesn't know how to make the machine work after its shape has changed.
To deal with this problem, the scientists put eight motors  and two sensors  that read how the machine is working. They all give signals to the machine's software. Using this information, the computer can then figure out the machine's shape at any moment.
The new technology is a big advance in robot-making, scientists say, and it's far from scary. It may someday help scientists create better artificial  arms and legs and give new freedom to people who lose _ . It might also help scientists understand how people and animals figure out their own sense of place in space.
""It has been difficult to design robots that can work well when the environment changes or when it's damaged,"" says Olaf Sporns of Indiana University in US. ""With this work, we are nearer to solving this problem.""",middle1655.txt
