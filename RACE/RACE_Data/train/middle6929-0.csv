0,B,"['a warm hug', 'a handshake', 'a kiss on the cheek', 'two kisses on the cheek']","In Britain, people usually greet each other with  _  .","Did you know that about 55% of communication is unspoken, so in fact, our bodies are actually saying more than our words. I find that the key to a successful conversation in any language is to speak to people not only in their spoken language but also with the body language they know best.
Britain, along with much of Northern Europe, has a non-touch culture, so personal space is very important. In a formal  situation, we would usually greet each other with a handshake. Informally, but not so often, my British friends and I would greet with a hug. Hardly ever would we greet with a kiss on the cheek, let alone a hug and two kisses on the cheek![:||]
Here in the south of Italy, and in many different parts of the world, both men and women greet with two kisses on the cheek, use a lot of hand signs and often touch each other. In other words, little personal space is left between people when communicating.
At university, I have learnt to successfully communicate in spoken Italian. And since I moved to live with the local people, I have also started to pick up their body language. Sometimes, I find myself not knowing what hand signs to use when expressing myself. However, what I know for sure is that I would miss the opportunity to fully put myself in the Italian culture if I keep my personal space unbroken.
Here are 5 body language tips in Italy;
* Use different signs; head, arms and hands.
* Use facial expressions. Always smile at people! It is said that smiling is the most powerful unspoken way to communicate friendliness.
* Use eye contact , because ""the eyes are the window to the soul.""
* Don't worry about personal space. Italians are a people who like to use the sense of touch, so moving away or keeping your distance may be considered as being unfriendly.
* Touch. When meeting and leaving, always shake hands.",middle6929.txt
