2,D,"['report to the teachers', 'harm his good name in the dormitory', 'stop talking with his roommates', 'learn how to get on well with others']",Victor asks Ted to  _  .,"Dear Victor,
I am a college student. Nowadays games on the net are very popular with college students. Some of my roommates are very interested in them. They not only play games in their free time, but also keep talking about them at night when lights are off, and they regard games as a part of their life. I've asked them to give it up, but they wouldn't listen to me. It has become a rather big problem. Should I report it to our teachers or do something else?
Ted
Dear Ted,
Drop it. Your roommates, as grown--ups, can do whatever they want with their time so long as it doesn't break school rules or violate other people's interests.
Playing perhaps gives these students relaxation from hard study. If they play too often and have little time to study, they will reap what they have sown , but you will not. Reporting to the teachers would only harm your good name in your dormitory . However, you have rights to ask your roommates to be quiet when you need sleep. If they aren't angry with you, they will stop talking. But be polite and friendly. Perhaps, in return, join them in a game or two.
