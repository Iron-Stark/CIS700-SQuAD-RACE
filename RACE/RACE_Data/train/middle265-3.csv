3,D,"['We should protect the endangered birds.', 'The cage is used to keep birds.', 'The birds are easily killed.', 'To keep love is to let it fly.']",What does the story want to tell us?,"One day a lonely girl found two weak birds while she was walking in the woods . She took them home and put them in a small cage. She fed them with love and the birds grew strong. Every morning they greeted her with a beautiful song. The girl loved them very much and wanted their singing to last forever.
One day the girl left the cage's door open. The larger and stronger of the two birds flew out of the cage. The girl watched worriedly as it circled  high above her. She was afraid that it would fly away and she would never see it again. So when it flew close, she grasped  at it wildly. She was very happy that she held it tightly within her hand! Suddenly, she felt something had happened to the bird. She opened her hand and was surprised to find the bird was dead. Her love for the bird killed it.
She noticed the other bird jumping in the cage. She could feel that it wanted to be free. It hoped to fly into the clear, blue sky. She lifted  it from the cage and flew it into the air. The bird circled once, twice, three times...
When the bird was flying happily in the sky, she was so glad. Just then the bird flew closer and sat softly on her shoulder. It sang the sweetest song she had ever heard.",middle265.txt
