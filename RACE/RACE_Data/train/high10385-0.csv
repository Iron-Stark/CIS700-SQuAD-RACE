0,D,"['Seeme@2', 'Dream4future', 'Visit$me', 'Stay@4ever']",Which of the following passwords fits the company's requirements?,"""YOUR password has expired  ,"" a message said on my screen, with instructions for changing it. Coming up with a new code   doesn't seem like a big deal, unless you work at my company, where we have to change it monthly, using at least one uppercase   character, one lowercase character, one symbol, and one number. Oh, the whole password can't be fewer than eight characters. And I can't use any of the same passwords I've used in the past three months.
Suddenly I was furious  . What didn't make it any better was that I was deeply depressed after my recent divorce. Disbelief about what she had done to me was all I thought about every day.
I remembered a tip I'd heard from my former boss. He'd said: ""I'm going to use a password to change my life.""
I couldn't focus on getting things done in my current mood. There were clear signs of what I needed to do to get control of my life again.
My password became the sign. My password reminded me that I shouldn't let myself be a victim of my recent breakup and that I was strong enough to do something about it.
I made my password Forgive@h3r.
I had to type this several times a day. The simple action changed the way I looked at my ex-wife. That constant reminder led me to accept the way things had happened and find a new way of dealing with my depression. As the month wore on, I felt a slow healing begin to happen. By the time my server asked me to reset my password the following month, I felt free.
One month later, my dear Exchange server asked me yet again to reset my password. I thought about the next thing that I had to get done.
My password became Quit@smoking4ever.
I quit smoking overnight.
This password was a painful one to type during that month, but doing it helped me to yell at myself in my mind as I typed that statement. It motivated me to follow my monthly goal.
One month later, my password became Save4trip@thailand.
Guess where I went three months later: Thailand.
Seeing how these reminders helped to achieve my goals kept me motivated and excited. While it's sometimes difficult to come up with your next goal, keeping at it brings great results",high10385.txt
