0,C,"['lighter than the year before', 'planning to go on a diet', 'heavier than the year before', 'with the Weight Watchers']",Mr. Fitzpatrick was   _   when spoke at the company dinner last year.,"Mr. Fitzpatrick has given much attention to his ""Weight reduction""   programs. Just last year, for example, when he was the main speaker at the company dinner, he said he put on twenty pounds instead of losing thirty he promised he would.
The year before that, he joined a health club. He exercised every day and ate less food. At the end of three months, however, he began making excuses about why he couldn't go there more often.
After the health club failed to work, he joined Weight Watchers but stopped going because he was the only man there. And he hated following any of the diet programs. Fitz's latest idea is to join a walking club to ""walk off"" the weight.",high20009.txt
