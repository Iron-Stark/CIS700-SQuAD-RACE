Wang's lawyer Wen Jun said they filed a lawsuit   at the Donghu district court, making two demands.
First, Wang wants Carrefour to make a public apology and the apology letter should be put up in the Carrefour store or in the media.
""We also demand 50,000 yuan in compensation   for my wife's psychological injuries,"" Wang's husband, Yan Fucun, said, ""We don't mean to _ money from Carrefour, but asked for it as a recognition of respect. Besides the money spent on lawsuit costs, I will donate the rest to charity.""
Wang earlier said she went to the store's Guanggu branch to buy cereal. She picked up 20 packs of a particular brand and was given another four as gifts by a saleswoman. However, when she arrived at the checkout, the cashier insisted Wang pay for all 24 packs, which led to an argument. The saleswoman later denied she said the extra packs were free. A store supervisor led Wang to an office, accused her of theft and had her sign a form and pose for photos. Wang and her husband returned to the store the next day with the local media to demand an explanation.
Carrefour China then apologized for the incident on its Sina micro blog, saying the managers and staff members involved have visited Wang's home and apologized. The company also sent three apology letters to Wang in the following three days.
Eric Legros, president of Carrefour China, said,""We made a mistake and we apologized four times. Four times, you know. And Carrefour will not do anything more about it.""
Wen Jun said the supermarket's management came with risks. For instance, Wen said the company would offer employees money if they caught a thief in the store. ""I hope this case will be a warning for the staff who want to get money by such an immoral   method,"" Wen said.",high8845.txt
