My sister Ann and I are going to have a party this Friday at my home. Some friends will be there. Most of them are from the office. My best friend, Tom, will come, too. I want you to meet him.
Do you want to come? We'll play games and talk. Then we'll have dinner. Everyone will bring food or drinks. It begins at 4:00 pm. and ends at 8 or 9 pm.
We'll have a great time! Can you come?I hope so! Let me know soon. Call me or send me an e-mail.",middle457.txt
