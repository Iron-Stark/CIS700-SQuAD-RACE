1,D,"['you can hire a beautiful woman to read the e-mail to you', 'you can see the person who sends you the e-mail', 'you can send an e-mail free of charge', 'e-mail can be attractive in a more lovely way']",The main advantage of Facemail is that  _  .,"When I opened my e-mail the other day,a pretty woman named Rachel appeared on my computer screen.She greeted me by name and started talking with great enthusiasm.Every now and then she stopped to smile at me or blow a kiss.She was reading to me an e-mail from my brother,and a lot of it was about his getting the phone company to give him a highspeed Internet connection.It was pretty cool.
Rachel was there thanks to a new technology called Facemail.Facemail lets you send an email that gets ready to the receiver by an attractive male or female form or by a clown .The software,which is free,can be downloaded at www.Facemail.com.
Facemail faces are lifelike,and they simulate emotions based on emotions that you put in your text.For example,type in X,and Rachel will blow a kiss.
LifeFX,the company that develops the Facemail,is sure there are broad business uses.The reason ebusiness is not popular,the company says,is that buying over the Internet lacks the human touch.But what if you went to the Nike website and Michael Jordan greeted you by name,waited for you and personally closed the sale?And it is talking with Whirlpool about using the technology in a computer screen on a fridge.Then if Mom can't be home when the kids get back from school,she can leave a note with voice and image telling them what there is to eat.
Facemail could get hot fast.Personally,I'm a fan.But Facemail should be used with care.The clown looks lively and funny at first.But if you select the clown,put a few rude words in an email and add some angry emotions,you've got a Psychomail .",high18764.txt
