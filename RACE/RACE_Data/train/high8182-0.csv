0,A,"['he was unsatisfied with the present his daughter gave him', 'the box his daughter gave him was empty', 'he had expected what was in the box', 'nobody gave him an empty box before']",The man yelled at his daughter because   _  .,"The story goes that some time ago, a man punished his 3--old--daughter for wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became angry when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree. However, the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, ""This is for you, Daddy.""
The man was embarrassed by his earlier overreaction, but his anger burst again when he found out the box was empty. He yelled at her, stating, ""Don't you know when you give someone a present, there is supposed to be something inside?"" The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and cried, ""Oh, Daddy, it's not empty at all. I blew kisses into the box. They are all for you, Daddy.""
The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl and begged for her forgiveness.
Only a short time later, an accident took the life of the child. It is also told that her father kept that gold box by his bed for many years and whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it there.",high8182.txt
