4,B,"['Because they are sleeping at night.', ""Because they aren't sleeping at night.."", 'Because they are beautiful at night.', ""Because they aren't dangerous at night.""]",Why is the best time to watch some animals at night?,"As we all know, animals are our good friends. Many kids love animals very much. They like to go to the zoo every Saturday, Sunday or even every day on weekdays. But do you want to go to the zoo at night?
Usually, the zoos aren't open at night. But if you are in   Singapore, you may have a chance to visit a zoo at night. There is a night zoo in Singapore. Its name is Night Safari. It is open at night. Why? That's because many animals only wake up  in the evening, like tigers and wolves. During the day, they like to sleep, so it's the best time to watch them at night.
Is that interesting? Welcome to the Night Safari!",middle4546.txt
