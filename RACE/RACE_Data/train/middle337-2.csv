How do you deal with(,) your worries? There is always something you can do to help yourself feel less worried. Sitting there worrying is no fun and it won't solve your problems.
Grades(,) at school are often a top worry for children. If you worry most about grades, ask yourself these questions:
*  Why are grades important? What do grades mean to me?
*  How do I get ready for class? Do I go over my notes even when there isn't a test?
*  Do I have a good place to do my homework?
*  Have I tried different ways of studying?
If your worry is about a fight you had with your friend, you might write down all the things you could do----write a note to him or her, invite him or her to watch a basketball game, say sorry to him or her and so on. Once you have a list of things you could do, you can choose one thing that could get your friend back.
You can ask for help when you're worried. You can find someone to talk to, such as your parents, friends, and teachers.",middle337.txt
