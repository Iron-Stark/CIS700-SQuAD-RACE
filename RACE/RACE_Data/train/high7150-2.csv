2,A,"['A Fun Day', 'the charity 4Children', 'Take a Break Magazine', 'Anne Longfield OBE']",Which of the following is probably a name of an activity?,"A 12-year old boy who donated bone marrow   to his dying sister and has raised more thanPS10,000 for charity has been named the UK's Family Hero of the Year.
Adam Kerr, 12, from Armagh, Northern Ireland, also helps his mother care for his younger brother Brian, 9, who suffers from the genetic disease Fanconi's anaemia  . But it is not the first hardship that has affected young Adam. When he was just six, he donated his own bone marrow to his younger sister Helen who suffered from a rare blood disorder. Sadly she developed complications and died a few months after the operation in 2005.
Adam found it very difficult to be happy after Helen's death. So he decided to start raising money in memory of Helen to help local poor children and families with bereavement  . Overall he has raised PS10,000 and he has no intentions of giving up.
He organised a Fun Day to provide the money for a brother and sister from Northern Ireland to visit their sick brother having a bone marrow transplant in a London hospital.
He received his award and a cheque forPS2,000 at an ""Oscar's style"" ceremony in London. Ms Phillips said: ""Adam is an incredible young man. In his relatively short life he has faced real sadness and bad luck and yet he works tirelessly to make life better for others.""
The Awards were sponsored by the charity 4Children and Take a Break Magazine. Anne Longfield OBE, Chief Executive of 4Children said:""It's an honour to recognise Adam's devotion and self-sacrifice, and his bravery shows there is always reason for hope and optimism. There is so much unrecognized goodwill out there of people who do so much for others, and the inspiring winners of the Family Heroes Awards remind us how important it is for us all to do our best to make a difference in the lives of others.""",high7150.txt
