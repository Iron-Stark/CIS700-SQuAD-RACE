0,D,"['He is a doctor in the army now.', 'He is going to give up his work.', 'He has been retired for many years.', 'He knows a lot about the city the author is going to visit.']",What can we know about Mr. Stone?,"Five people are at our table, including myself. I've already learnt a great deal about them in the short time we've been at sea, although we rarely meet except at mealtimes.
First of all, there is Dr. Stone. He is a man of about sixty-five, with gray hair and a friendly face. He gave up his work a short while ago and is now traveling round the world before he retires to some quite country village. As a young man, he served for many years as a doctor in the army and visited many countries. He's told us a great deal about the city to which they are going.
Then there is ""Grandmother"". I call her that because her name escapes me. In spite of being a grandmother, she looks remarkable young, no more than fifty. She is on her way to visit a daughter who went to Australia some years ago. Naturally she is very excited at the thought of seeing her again, and her three grandchildren, whom she has never seen.
Then there is a man I don't care for very much, the engineer by the name of Barlow. He has been _ in England and is now returning to his work in Singapore.
The other person who sits at our table is Mrs. Hunt. I've found out hardly anything about her. She's extremely quiet and rarely talks, except to consult the doctor about children's various illnesses. She is on her way to join her husband in India.",high1836.txt
