There is a very simple reason: We live on the earth, and it is the only place we can live on right now, as we cannot live in space yet.

If we treat it well by being eco-conscious, the earth will stay clean and suitable for living, for ourselves and for our children.
What is ""being eco-conscious""?
Being eco-conscious means being aware of your actions, and what you do to the environment. For example, you might think, ""Using hairspray is great for fixing my hair."" However, if you are eco-conscious, you would ask, ""Does this hairspray have CFCs in it? Could I be destroying the earth by using hairspray?""
