1,A,"['a boring lecture is given', 'an interesting story is told', 'watching a long TV programme', 'having a conversation with the teacher']","According to the text,it is helpful to doodle when  _  .","A lot of teachers hate doodlers during classes.""Pay attention!""Teachers will often warn doodling students,sure that they must be daydreaming.
However, according to a recent study, doodling while listening to a boring lecture helps  concentrate the attention:
Andrade,a psychology professor in England asked participants to listen to a boring lecture. Half the participants were told to color in squares and circles freely on a piece of paper while listening to the lecture.The other half weren't given a task.After it was over, the participants were asked to retell the lecture.
Those given the doodling task(color in squares and circles)remembered 29 percent more information than the non-doodlers.Andrade said.
""If someone is doing a boring task,like listening to a dull conversation,they may start daydream,""said Professor Andrade.
""Daydreaming distracts them from the task,resulting in poorer performance.A  simple task,like doodling,can stop them from daydreaming without affecting their performance at the task,""he said.
So the next time you're doodling during a class,and you hear""pay attention"",you can tell  the teacher with confidence that you've been paying attention to every word.",high948.txt
