2,B,"['Choosing clothes.', 'Playing computer games', 'Drawing his pictures.', 'Handling electronic gadgets.']",Which of the following is NOT included in the things that DanKam helps Sparkman with?,"When Jeff Sparkman draws his cartoon superheroes with colored pencils, he often has to ask other people to tell him what color his masked men turned out to be because he's color-blind. Now, a new smart phone application (app) can help him figure out what colors he's using and how the picture looks to most everyone else.
The DanKam app, available for iPhone and Android for $2.99, is an application that turns the vague colors that one percent of the population with color-blindness sees into the ""true"" colors as everyone else sees them. In America, an estimated 32 million color-blind Americans--95% are males--can soon have their life improved.
""DanKam takes the stream of data coming in through the phone's camera and changes the colors slightly so they fall within the range that people who are color-blind see,""developer Dan Kaminsky told CNET. He came up with the idea after watching the 2009 film Star Trek with a color-blind friend.
It was then that he got to know more about colorblindness like its varying types and degrees. A vast majority, for instance, have trouble seeing red or green due to a genetic defect . Blue-yellow colorblindness, however, is rarer and develops later in life because of aging, illness or head injuries, etc. He started experimenting with one of the most common representations of points in the RGB color model. What the DanKam app attempts to do is to clean up the color space of the image or video signal so that colors can be _ to those suffering from viewing problems. ""You can adjust the app to fit your needs. There is a range and not everyone who is color-blind sees things the same."" Says Kaminsky.
Sparkman, a copy editor at CNET, tried out the app and was pleased with the results. ""It would be useful for dressing for a job interview,"" he said. But using it for his art is ""the most practical application."" It worked well on LED and other lights on electronic gadgets, which means Sparkman can now identify the power light on his computer display as green.",high9585.txt
