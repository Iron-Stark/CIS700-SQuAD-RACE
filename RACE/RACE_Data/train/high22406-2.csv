Stay away from religious/ strong political beliefsks5u
While you may firmly believe in something, beginning conversations and making small talk about your own personal beliefs may  _ end the conversation. Keep it light, and don't try to convince the other person that you have the ""correct"" information about a higher being, political system or other belief system.
Use the Internet to gain the specific vocabulary
If you have a business meeting, or are meeting people who share a common interest, take advantage of the Internet to learn the specific vocabulary. Almost all business and interest groups have glossaries  on the Internet.
Find common interests
Once you have a subject that interests both of you, keep to it! You can do this in a number of ways: talking about travel, talking about the school or friend you have in common, talking about the difference between your culture and the new culture(just be careful to make comparisons and not judgments) and so on.
Listen
This is very important. Listening carefully will help you understand and encourage those speaking to you. You might be nervous, but letting others state their opinion will improve the quality of the discussion and give you some time to think of an answer!",high22406.txt
