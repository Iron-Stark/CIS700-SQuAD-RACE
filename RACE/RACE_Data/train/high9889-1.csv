1,C,"['Because it helps kids with their homework.', 'Because kids will be educated well at school.', 'Because kids will enjoy quality family time.', 'Because parents can have more time to rest.']",Why is the new idea well accepted by some parents?,"Homework will not be a concern for pupils attending a pioneering new secondary school in Norfolk. Instead, the 1,100 children will stay longer at school, doing extra study at school as part of the extended school day, which could last until about 5 pm.
Rather than setting homework that pupils could struggle with at home, where there may be limited access to computers, they will do that as independent study in the day. When they go home they should enjoy quality family time. That has been really well received by parents who respect the fact that family time will be family time. But the school would still expect youngsters to study at home ahead of important exams.
Independent learning at school would ensure equality because kids who get help with homework from parents might rely on others too much.
Peter Devonish , a teacher at the school, said, ""Having the children at school a bit longer to strengthen their learning is a really good idea, because they can have their time with the family."" But he warned. ""A disadvantage is that our school is in the countryside, which means it's not so perfect to get children home at that time.""
Mr. Devonish said they also set pupils project-based homework, such as looking at an energy-efficient house, which allowed them to combine independent study with working with their parents.
Craig Morrison, another teacher, said, ""A large problem with homework has been that not enough is done with it. With homework, a lot of effort can go into it, so it's about celebrating what children do rather than processing it in terms of marking it and handing it back.""",high9889.txt
