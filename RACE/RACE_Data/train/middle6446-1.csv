1,D,"['angry', 'pleased', 'excited', 'puzzled']",The farmer was   _   with the little man's word at first.,"Years ago a farmer owned land along the Atlantic seacoast. He constantly advertised for hired hands but never made it because most people were afraid of the awful storms.
Finally, a short, thin man, approached  the farmer. ""Are you a good farmhand?"" the farmer asked him.
""Well, I can sleep when the wind blows,"" answered the little man.
Although puzzled by this answer, the farmer still hired  him. The little man worked well around the farm, busy all day, and the farmer felt pleased with the man's work.
Then one night the wind blew strongly. Jumping out of the bed, the farmer carried a lantern and rushed next door to the hired man's sleeping quarters. Farmer shook the little man and shouted, ""Get up! A storm is coming! Tie things down before they blow away!""
But the little man said firmly, ""No sir. I told you, I can sleep when the wind blows.""
The farmer had no time to lose his temper. Instead, he hurried outside to prepare for the storm. To his surprise, he found everything had been prepared. The cows were in the barn, the chickens were in the coops, and the doors were barred. The shutters were tightly secured. Everything was tied down. Nothing could blow away. The farmer then understood what his hired man meant.
When you're prepared, spiritually, mentally and physically , you have nothing to worry about. Can you sleep when the wind blows through your life? The hired man in the story was able to sleep because he had protected the farm against the storm.",middle6446.txt
