4,A,"['Some customs in Canada', 'Dinner party rules in Canada', 'Studying in Canada', 'Doing business in Canada']",What would be the best title for this passage?,"Don't be surprised when strangers talk to you in Canada! You will find that many Canadians will smile at you as they pass in the street, or say something to you like ""Hi!"" or ""How's it going?"" Just reply with something similar. In the UK the reply would be ""I'm fine"", but in Canada they say ""I'm good"".
In company, when someone is offering you a second helping of food or more wine, if you don't want any more, use the same expression-- ""I'm good"". In this case, it means ""No, thank you. I've had enough"". Most Canadians don't press you to eat more than you want.
In restaurant, your plate will be cleared away almost immediately you have finished eating. When you go into a shop or store, the shop assistant asks you how you are or if they can help you, it is their way of being friendly and making conversation with the customers.
Canadians eat early and go home early. When you are invited to a Canadian's home, you may be asked to arrive at 5:30 pm or 6 pm. But guests in Europe don't expect to arrive until 7:30 pm or 8 pm. Remember to take off your shoes and leave them inside the door without being asked. It's not a religious custom, but it's practical. In winter, there can be a lot of snow and dirt on your shoes, once you are in the warm house it melts and falls off, making a mess. Canadians tend to have light colored carpets or hardwood floors.
If you're invited for dinner, it will be a full sit- down meal. Meat is usually barbecued in the freezing cold of winter. Do take something with you, like a bottle of wine. Arrive on time and don't stay over 10 pm.",high16210.txt
