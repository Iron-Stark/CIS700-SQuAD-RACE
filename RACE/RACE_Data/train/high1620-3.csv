3,C,"[""stayed in John's house for a night"", ""took some of John's things away"", 'left John some advice', ""was a good friend of John's""]",The visitor  _  .,"John Smith was a writer, who wrote detective stories for magazines , though he never dealt with criminals . One evening he could not finish an end for a story. He sat in his study , but he had no ideas. So he decided to go to the cinema.
When he came back, he found that he had had a visitor. Someone had broken into his house. The visitor had had a drink, smoked several of his cigarettes and had read his story. The visitor left him a note. ""I have read your story and I don't think it is very good. Please read my suggestions and you can finish it. By the way, I am a thief. I'm not going to steal anything tonight. But if you become a successful writer, I will return.""
John read the thief's suggestions. Then he sat down and wrote the rest of the story. He is still not a successful writer, and he is waiting for his ""visitor"" to return. Before he goes out in the evening, he always leaves a half-finished story in his study.",high1620.txt
