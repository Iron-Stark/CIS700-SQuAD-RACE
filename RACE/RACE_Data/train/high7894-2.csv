2,A,"['The salt scare is not reasonable.', 'The cause of hypertension is disclosed.', 'The moderate use of salt is recommended.', 'Salt consumption is to be avoided.']",What is the main idea of the passage?,"In recent years, there has been a steady attack on salt from the doctors: salt is bad for you--regardless of your health. Politicians also got aboard. ""There is a direct relationship,"" US Congressman Neal Smith said, ""between the amount of sodium  a person consumes and heart disease, circulatory  disorders, stroke and even early death.""
Frightening, if true! But many doctors and medical researchers are now beginning to feel the salt scare has gone too far. ""All these remarks and cry about salt is unnecessary,"" Dr. Dustan insists. ""For most of us it probably does not make much difference how much salt we eat."" Dustan's most recent short-term study of 150 people showed that those with normal blood pressure experienced no change at all when placed on an extremely low-salt diet, or later when salt was reintroduced. Of the hypertensive  patients, however, half of those on the low-salt diet did experience a drop in blood pressure, which returned to previous level when salt was reintroduced.
""An adequate to somewhat excessive  salt intake has probably saved many more lives than it has cost in the general population,"" said Dr. John H Laragh. ""So an opinion that the whole population should avoid salt makes no sense.""
Medical experts agree that everyone should practice reasonable ""moderation""  in salt consumption. For the average person, a moderate amount might run from four to ten grams a day, or roughly 1/2 to 1/3 teaspoons. One to two grams of salt would come from the natural sodium in food. The rest would be added in processing, preparation or at the table.
""Na is not your enemy,"" says Comek's Dr. Laragh. ""Salt is the No.1 natural component of all human tissue, and the idea that you do not need it is wrong. Unless your doctor has proven that you have a salt-related health problem, there is no reason to give it up.""",high7894.txt
