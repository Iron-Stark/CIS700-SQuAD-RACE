1,B,"['The freestyle swimming', 'Change for the best', ""Ning's life"", 'The first Asian swimmer']",The best title of the article is   _  .,"""He could have lived on his good looks, but instead he chose to live on talent and hard work."" This is how Internet users praised Chinese swimmer Ning Zetao.
On Aug 6, the 22-year-old won the 100-meter freestyle at the 2015 FINA Swimming World Championships in Russia. He was the first Asian to ever achieve this. Overnight the 191-cm-tall, handsome young man became the nation's hero. Ning didn't let the sudden fame  get to his head. He said he only saw ""a slight change"" in his life after winning.
""My life is full of changes and challenges,"" he said . ""I welcome them and am never afraid of _ ."" The first big change in Ning's life came at 2009.At the time, he specialized  in breaststroke  and was successful. But he felt a sharp pain in his knee. He suffered  every time he practiced his kicks. When he was 16,the knee pain got worse, and he had to stop swimming the breaststroke. Then he switched to sprint freestyle swimming. Ning didn't let the change bring him down. Instead, he took advantage of it and became one of the best freestyle swimmers. Last year, he won four gold medals in freestyle races at the Incheon Asian Games in South Korea.
What is the next change Ning would like to see in his life? He said he wants to improve on his English. ""English will help me communicate with foreign coaches and compete in the world games in the future."" Obviously Ning has high expectations for himself at the Rio Olympics next year. We wish him good luck.",middle5873.txt
