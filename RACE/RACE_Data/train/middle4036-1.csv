1,C,"['The doctor asked her to let him in.', 'She thought he might be able to save the baby.', 'She thought it might be his last chance to see his sister.', 'She wanted to know what Michael would do for his sister.']",Why did Karen decide to take Michael to see the newborn baby?,"Like any good mother, when Karen found out that another baby was on the way, she did what she could do to help her 3-year-old son Michael prepare for it. She and her husband found out that the new baby was going to be a girl. Day after day, night after night, Michael sang to his sister in his mom's tummy  .
Finally, Michael's little sister was born. But she was in a very serious condition. The doctor told the parents there was very little hope. They kept the baby girl in the intensive care unit (ICU, ). Karen was so sad. She decided to plan for her funeral  . Michael, however, kept begging his parents to let him see his sister. ""I want to sing to her,"" he would say. Finally Karen decided to take Michael to his sister. This may be the last time he sees her alive.
Michael looked at his baby sister. After a moment, he began to sing. In the pure-hearted voice of a 3-year-old, Michael sang: ""You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are gray.""
Instantly the baby girl seemed to _ . Her pulse rate   began to calm down.
""Keep on singing, Michael,"" encouraged Karen with tears in her eyes. ""You never know, dear, how much I love you, please don't take my sunshine away."" As Michael sang to his sister, the baby's breath became smooth.
After a few days, the little girl was well enough to go home. The doctors called it a miracle  .
