Later Disney World was opened in Florida in 1971. It cost between $500 and $600 million to build. Tokyo Disney Park opened in Japan in 1983, and Europe Disney opened in France in 1992.
Now Hong Kong is going to build a Disney Park and it will be open in 2005.
More than 80% of Hong Kong's population would like to visit the Disney Park when it is opened. But about half of them thought the adult admission fee  , of between HK $250 to HK $300 (US $32 to US $38), was too high. The children's admission fee is not known yet. But children may not mind paying any entrance fee. ""If I start saving money now, I'll have enough money to pay the entrance fee in five years' time."" Said Chan Posang, a 12-year-old girl. "" I can't take my son to the Disney Park in the USA."" Said Mrs Yu, mother of a small boy, ""That's why I agree with the government's plan to build one here. There I'll be able to take my son there. The admission fee of several hundred dollars is nothing compared with (......)the price of an air ticket to the USA.""",middle4862.txt
