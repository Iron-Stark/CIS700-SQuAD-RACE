Learn a new language
Acquiring a new language involves different learning methods. Learning a language sharpens your brain and helps prevent memory problems in later years.
Master a new subject
Each week, select an animal, a bird or a fish, and read everything you can about it. Stretch  your brain as you become an expert on the subject.
Use your non-dominant hand
If you are right-handed, use your left hand for everyday activities, or use your right hand if you are left-handed. Doing familiar things in a new way will cause your brain to create new neural networks.

Do puzzles
According to the Mayo Clinic, doing sudoku and crossword puzzles keeps the brain sharp into your senior years.
