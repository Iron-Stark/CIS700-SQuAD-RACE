0,D,"['no parents', 'no secrets', 'poor memories', 'mental problems']",The students who often become worried or have trouble getting on with others may have   _  .,"Mr. Ma, a famous mental doctor from Beijing once said at an important meeting, ""Now many young students can have problems with their minds. Some students become worried because they have to study very hard. Others have trouble getting on well with people around them like their parents and classmates. Parents and teachers should care more about this problem.""
Then Mr. Ma gave some examples. One patient, a middle school students from Xi'an was doing badly in his lessons. He thought his teachers and friends often laughed at him, and he became so nervous and worried that one night he left his home without telling parents. Another student, a 14-year-old schoolgirl from Shanghai, was very afraid of exams. While she was reading the exam paper, she couldn't think of anything to write.
A recent report fromJiefang Dailysays about 18% of the young students in Shanghai have mental problems. They often felt worried and very unhappy. Unluckily many of them won't go and ask for help. Some think they will look _ if they go to see a doctor. Others won't talk about their secrets.
At the end of the meeting, Mr. Ma offered some good ideas to young people:
u     Talk to your parents or teacher often.
u     Take part in group activities.
u     Try to get on well with the people around you.
u     Go to see a doctor if you often feel unhappy.",middle1287.txt
