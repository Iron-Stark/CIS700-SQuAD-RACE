3,A,"['Wetsuit for An old Penguin', 'Old Penguin Getting Bald', 'Unwilling to Swim', 'Strange Look of Pierre']",The best title of the passage is  _  .,"Pierre is a 25-year-old penguin at the California Academy of Sciences.Due to his old age,he was going bald,which made him feel too cold to swim in the pool.Therefore,biologists at the academy had a wetsuit created for this penguin to help him get back in the swimming pool.
Unlike marine   mammals,which have a layer of blubber  to keep them  warm,penguins depend on their waterproof feathers.Without them,Pierre was unwilling to jump into the swimming pool and ended up trembling on the side of the pool while his 19 peers played in the water.
""He was cold:he would shake,""said Pam Schaller,a senior biologist.Schaller first tried a heat lamp to keep Pierre warm.Then she got another idea:if wetsuits keep humans warm in the cold Pacific,why not make one for Pierre?
Schaller designed the suit,which covered Pierre's body and had small openings for his flippers.
""I would walk behind him and look at where there were any gaps.and cut and refit until it looked like it was extremely suitable.""she said.
One concern was that the other penguins would reject Pierre in his new suit,but in fact,they accepted his new look.He swam freely and got along with others well,although he was the only penguin with a black stomach.
Schaller couldn't say for sure whether the wetsuit allowed Pierre to recover his fine feathers,but"" certainly we were able to keep him comfortable during a period of time that would have been very difficult for him to stay comfortable"".
Pierre will take off his suit after his new feathers grow back.",high8933.txt
