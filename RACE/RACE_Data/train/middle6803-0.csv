0,C,"['A playboy.', 'Running.', 'Basketball.', 'Playground']",What did the writer fall in love with?,"Dear Basketball                    And so I ran.
I ran up and down every playground
From the right moment                       I gave you my heart
I fell in love with you.                    Because it came with so much more.
A love so deep I gave you my all --
From my mind & body                        I played through the sweat  and hurt
To my spirit & soul .                 Not because challenge  called me
But because YOU called me.
As a six-year-old boy                     I did everything for YOU.
Deeply in love with you
I never saw the end of the tunnel.        You gave a six-year-old boy his dream
I only saw myself                         And I'll always love you for it.
Running out of one.                       Love you always.
