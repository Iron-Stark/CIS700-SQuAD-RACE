2,D,"[""he doesn't love his hometown"", 'he is a naughty boy and loves adventures', 'he has made mistakes', 'he has quarrelled with ROSE']","The little prince runs away, because   _  .","Although I'm not in my childhood, I still prefer reading fairy tales. They often make me think of some special experiences and feelings. This summer I've reviewed this kind of tales, The Little Prince. It was published in 1940. It's the world-famous fairy tale by the French author Antoine.
""I"", the narrator  of the story, is a pilot. His plane has something wrong and lands in the Sahara. The little prince lives on a small planet, and he grows a flower called ROSE there. One day they have a quarrel , so the little prince runs away. On his all-alone journey, he meets different kinds of people. From these people he gets a conclusion  that grown-ups are strange. And with the help of the man he meets, he descends in the Sahara.
This book moved me a lot. It is not only a fairy tale for children and teenagers, but also for grown-ups.
