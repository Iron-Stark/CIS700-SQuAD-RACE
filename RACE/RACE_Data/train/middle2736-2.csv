Stahl accept the money?,"Taking part in charity is not just for adult people. Kids can do it too! Melvin Sheppard, 14, an American student, has done charity work for 8 years. He has also encouraged his classmates to join him.
Melvin studies at William Allen Middle School in Philadelphia. Recently, he collected $ 1,500 by himself and $487 from his classmates to donate to Cooper University Hospital.
Melvin was born nine weeks premature   in Cooper University Hospital,  weighing 2.6kg. His father told him how Cooper saved his life, so he feels thankful to the hospital.
Melvin's classmates joined him once they found out about his kind behavior. Their teacher, Michael Bemer, also held a class with them about helping others. ""It wasn't really about the money,"" Bemer said.  ""It was about the fact that they were doing something good.""
""It feels great, helping someone that I know."" said Jordan, Melvin' s classmate. Melvin's neighbors also helped out.
Since Melvin was 6, he and his parents have given money to Cooper University Hospital every year. This year, Gray E. Stahl, the head of Cooper's division of neonatology , went to Melvin's school to accept the money.
The money goes to a part of the hospital that helps about 500 young patients every year.
""When they leave, we call them graduates,"" Stahl said, ""my co - workers and I are pleased when our graduates and their families do well, like Melvin and his family.""",middle2736.txt
