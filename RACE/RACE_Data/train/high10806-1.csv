1,A,"['Some are likely to be more aggressive.', 'They seem to easily get over the effect of bullying.', 'Most of them will respond to bullying normally.', 'Most of them are afraid of sharing their problems.']",What may happen to those first bullied later on in adolescence according to Newman and his colleagues?,"The age at which kids first fall victim to bullying  could influence how strongly they are affected,suggests a new study. And,surprisingly,it is not the youngest kids who are hurt the most in the long term.
Bullying can have long-lasting effects,but particularly when it begins in adolescence,the researchers say. People subjected to either verbal (  )or physical bullying are known to be at greater risk of developing depression,anxiety disorders or to behave violently. But not everyone reacts in this way.
Children bullied for the first time before they hit adolescence seem to get over it, but those who are bullied for the first time later on in adolescence seem to become more aggressive or are more likely to turn to drink as a means of coping. These are the conclusions of psychologist Matthew Newman and colleagues from the University of Texas at Austin,US.
The team gave questionnaires to nearly 1,500 college students regarding their experience of physical and psychological bullying before adolescence--before high school--and in late adolescence--at high school. They assessed mood and mental state,judging by signs of anxiety or depression,such as sleeplessness. The group was also questioned about how they would react to certain challenges,such as humiliation.
People who were bullied all revealed slightly higher levels of stress. But while those bullied earlier in life seemed to respond normally to provocation  ,people bullied for the
first time late in adolescence are more withdrawn and sensitive to violence.
There are also sex differences between those bullied for the first time during adolescence, with females more likely to react aggressively when provoked and males are much more likely to turn to alcohol to escape bad situations.
The best solution in all cases was strong social support,whether from friends,family or school. Those with no one to share their problems with suffered the most.
So perhaps it is best not to shelter children completely from bullying early on,suggests Newman. ""They may get stressed,but unhealthy coping really jumps out when they are bullied for the first time later on. """,high10806.txt
