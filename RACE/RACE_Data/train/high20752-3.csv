3,C,"['Two Attractive Shoppers.', 'Lorenzo Bertolla Sweaters.', 'Undercover Marketing.', 'How to buy things.']",Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?,"You're in a department store and you see a couple of attractive young women looking at a sweater. You listen to their dialogue:
""I can't believe it -- Lorenzo Bertolla! They are almost impossible to find. Isn't it beautiful? And it's a lot cheaper than the one Sara bought in Rome.""
They leave and you go over to see this unbelievable sweater. It's nice and the price is right. You've never heard of Lorenzo Bertolla, but those girls looked really stylish . They must know. So, you buy it. You never realize that those young women are employees of an advertising agency. They are actually paid to go from store to store, talking loudly about Lorenzo Bertolla clothes.
Every day we notice what people are wearing, driving and eating. If the person looks cool, the product seems cool, too. This is the secret of undercover marketing. Companies from Ford to Nike are starting to use it.
Undercover marketing is important because it reaches people that don't pay attention to traditional advertising. This is particularly true of the MTV generation -- consumers between the age of 18 and 34. It's a golden group. They have a lot of money to spend, but they don't believe in ads.
So advertising agencies hire young actors to ""perform"" in bars and other places where young adults go. Some people might call this practice misleading, but marketing executive Jonathan Ressler calls it creative. ""Look at traditional advertising. Its effectiveness is decreasing."" It is true, because everyone knows an ad is trying to persuade you to buy something. However, you don't know when a dialogue you overhear  is just a performance.",high20752.txt
