0,B,"['watched a TV programme with his parents', 'was on TV for the first time', 'played soccer in the park with his friends', ""saw the hosts of the programme Kid's Speak Out""]",Jack was excited yesterday because he_.,"I'm Jack, and I am a middle school student. Yesterday was the most exciting day in my life. I was on TV! This is my first time on TV. In the evening, Mum, Dad and I were watching a TV programme in the sitting room and there I was! This is how it happened.
I was playing soccer in the park with my friends when a man and a woman came to us. The man had a camera. The woman had a microphone. ""I'm from Channel 9,"" she said. ""Do you know the programme Kid's Speak Out?"" I did know it. I watched it often. It's a weekly programme where kids say what they think about different things.
""Would you like to be on it?"" the woman asked me.
I wanted to be on it and I thought my friends might also want to be on it, so I asked, ""Can my friends be on it too?""
""Sorry, only one of you can,"" the woman said. ""You can talk about it and decide which of you is going to be on the programme.""
I asked my friends if they wanted to be on the programme. They didn't, so I went on it. The woman asked me a lot of questions. I thought carefully and tried to give _ answers. When she finished, she said I was one of the best kids she'd spoken to! I felt very proud of myself. My mum and dad were proud of me too!",middle2196.txt
