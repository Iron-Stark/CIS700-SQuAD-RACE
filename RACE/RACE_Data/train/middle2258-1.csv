School should make our lunchtime longer. Now, our lunchtime is short. Many of my classmates have some homework to do after lunch . But if they do not get a good rest, they won't have enough energy for the afternoon. So I would like to have some time to take a nap  after lunch . That way we will learn well in the afternoon.

Food in our dining hall is not nice at all. There is always pork, fish, and cabbages. The soup is always cold. I think we should have different kinds of food every day. And why can't we have hot soup every day ? I am _ what we eat !

We want more time for sports activities. Students all need time for ball games. But there are only two hours for us to play ball games a week. I think school should be over before 4.30 p.m. every day and then we can go to the playground. I like badminton. All work and no play makes Jack a dull  boy !",middle2258.txt
