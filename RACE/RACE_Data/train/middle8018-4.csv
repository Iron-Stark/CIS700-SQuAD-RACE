The man saw a little girl crying on the road when he was about to enter the shop. The man asked her: ""Why are you crying?""
""I want to buy a rose for my mother, but I haven't got enough money,"" said the girl.
The man took the girl's hand and entered the flower shop. He first ordered the bouquet   for his mother and bought a rose for the girl.
Walking out of the shop, the man asked the girl if she would like a ride home.
""Will you really drive me home?"" she asked.
""Of course,"" the man replied.
""Then drive me to my mother. But the place where my mother lives is very far.""
The man drove along the mountain road and finally came to the cemetery  .
The little girl put the flower onto a new grave. In order to present a rose to her mother who had passed away a month before, she had gone on a very long journey.
The man drove the girl to her home and then returned to the flower shop. He cancelled the bouquet and bought a big bunch of fresh flowers instead. He drove directly to his mother's home, a five-hour drive from where he was. He would present the flowers to his mother in person.",middle8018.txt
