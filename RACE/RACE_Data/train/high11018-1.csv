1,B,"['Old friendship is easy to lose.', 'A good friendship is a useful medicine', 'The best doctor is your own body', 'It needs many efforts to build relationships']",Which of the following views may the writer agree to?,"Recently a man came to me, because he was told that there is fluid  around his heart. After trying many drugs which were of no use to reduce the fluid, the doctor told him the only other choice was to have an operation. He refused because he knew that every illness has a mental cause and that if he had the operation but did not clear the mental cause, the fluid would return. At last, he searched the Internet to find a metaphysical healer , and he found me.
The mental cause of his disease was an experience of breaking up five years ago with several friends, whom he had known for over twenty years. This experience broke his heart. Not knowing how to ""mend"" his broken heart, his body created a ""repair"" by surrounding his heart with fluid to protect it from the sad feelings.
Our work focused on reminding him of the feelings of being loved and forgiving his friends. Months later, his hearts was mended and the fluid disappeared. He left my office after the final session with a smile on his face and a spring in his step.
The key is: to create a healthy body, you must be healthy not only in body, but also in mind.
To be mentally healthy, you need to build up strong relationships. Creating strong relationships will insure that you are accompanied by a network of loving persons. _ is important for building a support system that lifts your spirits. Even when you are alone, you will not feel lonely or upset. Strong relationships are not spaceships----they are not hard to build.",high11018.txt
