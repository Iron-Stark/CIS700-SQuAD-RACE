0,A,"['five', 'four', 'three', 'two']","In China, Wang Jun had   _   English classes every week.","Hi, my name is Wang Jun. Do you want to know about my staying in America? Well, to tell you the truth, it is really an eye-opening experience here.
In China, I had English classes five times a week since Grade Five. But I didn't know textbook English could be so different from everyday English until I came to Hotchkiss School, Connecticut. When I first studied English, I was told to say ""I'm fine."" when people say ""How are you?"" But in the USA, I found that people say ""I'm good."" or ""I'm tired.""
One day, someone greeted   me with ""What's up?"" It made me _ I thought for a moment and then smiled because I didn't know what to say.
Since then, I have learnt more and more differences between Chinese and American cultures. To my surprise, American girls spend a lot of time in the burning sun getting a tan  . In China, girls try every possible way to keep their skin white.
American students are hard-working like Chinese students. In China, schoolwork is almost everything, so we study hard and that's it. But here, a ""good"" student not only gets good grades, but also does a lot for the public. That is to say, they get lots of knowledge at school and learn many life skills from social   work.",middle1573.txt
