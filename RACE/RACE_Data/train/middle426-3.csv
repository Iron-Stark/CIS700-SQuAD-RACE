3,C,"[""that you should answer the teacher's questions in class"", 'that you have the responsibility to do your homework', 'the rules you should follow as an American student', ""that it's polite to be on time for class""]",The main idea of the passage is   _  .,"American Classroom Rules
1. If the teacher asks a question, you should give an answer. If you do not understand the question, you should put up your hand and ask the teacher to repeat the question. If you don't know the answer, it's all right to tell the teacher that you don't know. Then he or she knows what you need to learn.
2. There is no excuse for not doing your homework. If you can not go to school, you should call your teacher or your classmate and ask for the homework. It is your responsibility to find out what homework you have missed. It is not the teacher's job to remind you of missed homework.
3. You must not be absent  on a test day. If you are badly ill, call and let the teacher know you will not be there for the test. If your teacher allows you to take a _ , you should take the test within one or two days after you return to class. Bad illness is the only reason for missing a test.
4. Be on time! It's not polite to be late. Also, it bothers other students. If you must come in late, be sure to do it quietly. Have your books out of your bag before you come into the classroom. Then go to your seat and sit quietly. In the US, it is not necessary to knock at the door before you come into the classroom.",middle426.txt
