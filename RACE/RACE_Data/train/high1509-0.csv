0,D,"[""Because he was the old man's son."", 'Because she knew that he was a warm-hearted man.', ""Because she couldn't find anyone else there."", ""Because she thought he was the old man's son.""]",Why did the nurse take the Marine to the old man's bed?,"A nurse took the tired, anxious serviceman to the bedside. ""Your son is here,""she said to the old man. She had to repeat the words several times before the patient's eyes opened.
Heavily drugged with sleep because of the pain of his heart attack, he dimly  saw the young uniformed Marine standing outside the oxygen tent. He reached out with his hand. The Marine wrapped his toughened fingers around the old man's weak ones, expressing a message of love and encouragement. The nurse brought a chair so that the Marine could sit beside the bed.
All through the night the young Marine sat there in the poorly lighted ward , holding the old man's hand and offering him words of love and strength. Occasionally, the nurse suggested that the Marine move away and rest a while. He refused. Now and then she heard him say a few gentle words. The dying man said nothing, only holding tightly to his son all through the night. Along towards dawn, the old man died.
The Marine released the now lifeless hand he had been holding and went to tell the nurse. While she did what she had to do, he waited.
Finally, she returned. She started to offer words of sympathy, but the Marine interrupted her.""Who was that man?""he asked. The nurse was surprised. ""He was your father,""she answered. ""No, he wasn't,""the Marine replied. ""I never saw him before in my life.""""Then why didn't you say something when I took you to him?""asked the nurse. ""I knew right away there had been a mistake, but I also knew he needed his son, and his son just wasn't here. When I realized that he was too sick to tell whether or not I was his son, knowing how much he needed me, I stayed.""he answered.",high1509.txt
