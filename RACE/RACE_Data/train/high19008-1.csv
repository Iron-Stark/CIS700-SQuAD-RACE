1,C,"['Every man has his faults', 'Fortune favors those who use their judgment', ""Don't judge a book by its cover"", 'Think twice before you do']",The best title for the text would be  _,"Last winter, when I was heavily pregnant, I was visiting my sister and brother-in-law's house and had to park in a nearby parking lot because they didn't have accessible parking. The snow was extremely heavy and there was lots of ice on the ground --- not many people had ventured out that evening! 
When I returned to my car around 11pm, I noticed that I was the only car left. Nervously, I hopped into the car and let it warm up a bit. When I finally tried to drive away, my wheels began to spin. I was stuck! I spun and spun and wondered what to do. 
All of a sudden, in my rear view mirror, I saw four teen-aged boys approaching my car. They were walking side by side in a line and dressed a bit like gang members --- at least I thought that's what they looked like. My car was in a very isolated area and I began to panic. I was certain they were coming to my car to harm me. Terrified, I just froze. One of the young men tapped on my window and said ""Excuse me, Ma'am, can we help you? You seem stuck."" Still afraid and fearing the worst, I said ""I am stuck."" And the young man said ""It's okay, stay in your car and we'll push you out of the snow."" And they did!
When they finally got me out of the snow, they smiled and waved. I rolled down my window and thanked them, embarrassed to have judged them so poorly",high19008.txt
