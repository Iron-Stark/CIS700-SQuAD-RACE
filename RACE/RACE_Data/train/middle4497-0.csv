QUESTION: Can you quickly learn to set a thermostat ?
Don't look down upon such a task. It shows your ability to solve problems in creative ways, said the OECD . The OECD recently gave a problem-solving test to 85,000 students. They were all 15 years old, and from 44 countries.
The test give each student four to eight everyday problems to solve. For example, they had to set a thermostat, and find the quickest way to a place. Students from Singapore and South Korea did the best job, said the OECD. They were quick learners, curious and able to solve problems that they were not familiar with. Students from Japan and China were also among the _ groups. They did a better job than those from countries like the US, Canada, Australia, the UK and France.
Problem-solving skills are important, said the OECD. ""Today's 15-year-olds with poor problem-solving will become tomorrow's adults struggling to find or keep a good job,"" said Andreas, acting director of Education and Skills at the OECD. ""The world economy no longer pays you for what you know. Google knows everything .The world economy pays you for what you can do with what you know,"" he said.",middle4497.txt
