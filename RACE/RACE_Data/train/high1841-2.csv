2,D,"['the younger musician is a positive person and would be a good friend', 'one will start complaining if one spends too much time with negative people', 'the exercise can help you keep close to really helpful friends', 'one should avoid making friends with people who have lots of difficulties']",We can get the following information from the passage EXCEPT   _  .,"The other day I heard a few local musicians talking: ""I hate all the pianos in this town and I hate that rubbish they play on the radio. They cannot even understand rhythm  .""""Nobody wants to pay musicians anything. I'm sick of all the people who want you to play without paying you.""...
One younger musician said, ""There are a couple of clubs who want me to play for a few nights a month, and I'm trying to find other places to play. I'm also planning to join in several summer festivals this year.""
I really liked what the younger musician said so I made friends with him. Attitudes are important. Whether they're positive or negative  , they're all rubbing off on you. If you're around people who are always complaining or blaming   others, it is possible that you will start doing the same as well. If you spend lots of time with people who don't support your dreams, it is time to take a look at the people you call ""friends"".
There is an easy exercise you can try. Make a list of the people who you often stay with, and simply stop spending time with the negative people on your list. Set a new standard for yourself and don't become friends with people who fall below that standard. The choice is always yours to make. Of course, this exercise is entirely different from making friends only for the good of oneself. We really should try to help and spend time with those who are working towards a goal or dream.",high1841.txt
