2,A,"['let the Japanese give special importance to the population problems', 'show the change of the Japanese population since 1975', 'explain the reason why there is a low birth rate in Japan', 'tell people that the Japanese life expectancy is the highest']",Japanese researchers created the population clock in order to   _  .,"On Friday, Japanese researchers announced a population clock that showed a dangerous situation that the Japanese nation would disappear in 1,000 years if the falling birth rate kept the present level. Researchers in the northern city of Sendai said that Japan's population of children aged up to 14, which now stands at 16.6 million, was falling at the rate of one child per 100 seconds. It would lead to a terrible result that there would be no children left in Japan in 1,000 years.
""If the rate keeps falling at that rate in our country, there will only be one child who is able to enjoy the following Children's Day left on May 5th, 3011,"" said Hiroshi Yoshida, a professor at Toholu University. ""But 100 seconds later, a national disaster that there are no children left in Japan will happen,"" he added, ""The nation's people will disappear for the birth rate has fallen to the level that every woman has no more than two children, which started in 1975."" Yoshida said they created the population clock to make Japanese people pay close attention to that problem for their nation's future.
Another study showed that Japan's population was expected to fall to one third of the present population amount: 127.7 million in the next century. The Japanese government predicted that the birth rate would just become 1.35 children per parents within 50 years.
At the same time, Japanese life expectancy which is expected to ascend from 86.93 years in 2010 to 90.93 years in 2060 for women and from 79.64 years to 84.19 years for men has already been one of the highest in the world. More than 20 percent of the Japanese are aged 65 or over.
It means that Japan has become one of the countries with aging populations in the world. The problem of aging populations is a headache for the government and the Japanese economy because there are fewer and fewer workers who can make money for the country. However, the government has to face the terrible situation that it needs to offer a growing number of pensions.",high23567.txt
