0,A,"['They have their own complicated  contents.', 'They have similar story backgrounds.', 'They have specific themes for children.', 'They have the same characters in each book.']",What is the feature of Munro's stories?,"Canadian short story writer Alice Munro won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Eighty-two-year-old Munro is only the 13th woman to win the 112-year-old prize.
Munro didn't publish her first collection of short stories until she was 37 years old, but her stories have always been well-received. Lots of her stories share similar themes and characters, but each story has its own twists and turns.
Even though she's won Canada's most famous literary award, the Giller Prize, twice, winning the Nobel Prize for Literature is the cherry on top of Munro's career. ""It brings this incredible recognition, both of her and her career, and of the dedication to the short story,"" said one person.
Along with the well-respected title comes 1.3 million dollars.Munro said everything was ""so surprising and wonderful"" and that she was ""dazed by all the attention and affection that has been coming my way.""
Munro knew she was in the running-she was named the second-most likely person to win this year's prize, after Haruki Murakami of Japan-but she never thought that she would win.
Munro's win also represents the long way Canadian writers have come.""When I began writing there was a very small community of Canadian writers and little attention was paid by the world.Now Canadian writers are read, admired and respected around the globe,"" Munro said on Thursday.
She is technically not the first Canadian to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, but many like to think that she is.In 1976 Saul Bellow, who was born in Quebec but moved to Chicago when he was still a child, won the prize.Even though he was born in Canada, he is mostly considered to be an American writer.
""This is a win for us all.Canadians, by our very nature, are not very nationalistic,"" said Geoffrey Taylor.""But things like this suddenly make you want to find a flag.""
She wasn't sure if she would keep writing if she won the prize, saying that it would be ""nice to go out with a bang.But this may change my mind.""",high9393.txt
