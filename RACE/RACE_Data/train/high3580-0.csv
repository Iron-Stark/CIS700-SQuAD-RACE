The man slowly looked up. He was Jack, who had been begging around here for a couple of years.
""See thatcafeteria over there?"" she asked. ""I'm going to get you something to eat and get you out of the cold for a while.""
She sat down at the table across from her amazed dinner guest. She stared at him intently. ""Jack, do you remember me?"" Old Jack thought hard and said, ""I think so--I mean you do look familiar.""
""I was thin and hungry,"" she said. ""Maybe I've _ now more than when you worked here. That was when I was just out of college. I had come to the city looking for a job, but I couldn't find anything. Finally I was down to my last few cents and had been kicked out of my apartment. I walked in the streets for days, cold and hungry. I saw this place and walked in hoping that I could satisfy my hunger.""
Jack lit up with a smile. ""Now I remember,"" he said. ""I was behind the serving counter. You came up and asked me if you could work for something to eat. I said it was against company's policy.""
The woman continued, ""Then you made me the biggest roast beef sandwich, gave me a cup of coffee, and told me to go over to a corner table and enjoy it. I was afraid that you would get into trouble. Then, I saw you put the price of my food in the cash register.""
""So you started your own business?"" old Jack said. ""I got a job that very afternoon. I worked my way up. Eventually I started my own business that, with the help of God,prospered."" She opened her purse and pulled out a business card. ""When you are finished here, I want you to pay a visit to a Mr. Lyons, the personnel director of my company. He'll find something for you to do around the office."" She smiled, ""If you ever need anything, my door is always open to you.""
There were tears in the old man's eyes, ""How can I ever thank you?"" he said. ""Don't thank me;"" the woman answered, ""thank yourself. It was your kindness that let me know you.""",high3580.txt
