1,D,"['felt greatly disappointed', 'was upset about it', 'cried all night', 'thought nothing of it']","When failing to get into the school play, the author's 7-year-old daughter   _  .","When I was 10 years old, I tried out for the cheerleading squad. I had taken gymnastics classes for two years to prepare for these tryouts. However, I didn't make the team. It was a heavy blow to me. I cried all night.
Kids today won't experience that kind of rejection. They're growing up in ""everybody gets a turn"" world where every child gets a chance to kick the ball, sing the song, and win the award. But that's not always such a good thing.
Parents have become fearful of letting kids fail, thinking that our children are easily hurt and will never recover from anything--that's a serious problem. Last week, my 7-year-old daughter didn't get into the school play. At first, I was upset by it. How would she react? When I gave her the news, I was ready to hug her and cry with her. She looked at me, made a slight face and said, ""That's too bad. What's for dinner?""
It clearly wasn't the end of her world. Maybe if we let our kids experience rejection once in a while, we'd realize they are much stronger than we think. Kids need to be able to handle disappointments; doing so helps them to prepare for real life. Most importantly, rejection carries the possibility not only for growth and can also motivate kids to try harder the next time.
Rejection is pain. There is no way around that. How will our kids ever discover their true talents if we don't let them? Instead of complaining, maybe we should consider rejection an opportunity.",high14856.txt
