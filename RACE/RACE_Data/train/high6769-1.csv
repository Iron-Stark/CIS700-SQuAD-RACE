1,C,"[""Reese's mother was a physician."", ""Freeway was Reese's big break."", 'Reese won the Oscar for Walk the Line.', ""New York was Reese's home town.""]",Which of the following is true according to the passage?,"The adolescent girl from Tennessee was standing on the stage of a drama summer camp in New York.But the girl didn't feel joyful.She was not the leggy,attractive Hollywood type.In fact,she described herself as stupid.
This girl was Reese Witherspoon,who had wanted to be a country singer and admired and respected Dolly Patton very much.
That day at the end of the camp her coaches told her to forget about singing.They suggested she think about another career.She took their words to heart.After all,why shouldn't she believe the professionals?
But back at home in Nashville,her mother--a funny,happy,optimistic woman--wouldn't let her feel depressed.Her father,a physician,encouraged her to achieve in schoo1.So she worked hard at everything and was accepted at Stanford University.
And at 1 9,she got a part in a low-budget movie called Freeway, which prepared for her role in the movie Pleasantville.But her big break came with Legally Blonde.
""If you can't sing and you aren't charming,play to your strengths.If you're going to make it in this business,better focus on what you're good at,""she told the interviewer later.
And then came the offer that took her back to her Nashville--playing the wife of a country star Johnny Cash,a singing role.
All of a sudden the old fears learned on that summer stage were back.She was so nervous on the stage.But she didn't give up on the movie or herself.She spent 6 months taking singing lessons again.She learned to play the Autoharp.And the hard work built up her confidence.
Last March,Reese Witherspoon walked up on another stage,the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood,and accepted the Oscar as Best Actress for her heartbreaking,heartwarming singing role as June Carter Cash in Walk the Line.",high6769.txt
