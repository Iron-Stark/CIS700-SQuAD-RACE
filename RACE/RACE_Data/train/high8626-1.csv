As for the climate of the country, well, it's hot and humid  in summer, but it is quite cold and wet in Japan during winter. Typhoons, which are violent tropical storms, often threaten Japan during the fall. That's, of course, during the harvest season.
The population of Japan is about 110,5 million. It may seem hard to believe, but the average population density  of the country is about 678 persons per square mile.
