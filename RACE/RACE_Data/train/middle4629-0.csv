0,D,"['In 2002.', 'In 2008.', 'In 2007.', 'In 2012.']",When did the scientists make sure they found a new species of monkey?,"The animal kingdom has a new member. On September 12, 2012, researchers made a report to the world that they discovered a new species  of monkey. It is called the lesula. And it is only the second monkey species discovered in 28 years.
Scientists first saw the lesula in June, 2007 in Congo, a country in Africa. The lesula lives in the rain forests. The monkey was first found as a pet in a local family. When researchers found it, the family told them that they caught the monkey in the wild and then kept it as a pet.
The scientists have compared the lesula to the owl-faced monkey. The owl-faced monkey gets its name for having a long nose and a face that looks like an owl . The lesula and the owl-faced monkey are similar in size and both have a stripe  on their nose. This shows the lesula and the owl-faced monkeys are close relatives, but different species. Scientists say the lesula usually weighs about twelve pounds. It has long blond hair. It eats like a vegetarian .
Scientists say it is important to protect African rain forests because there may be other new species like lesula to be discovered in the future.",middle4629.txt
