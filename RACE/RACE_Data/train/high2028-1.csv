1,D,"['Parents want to know how to educate their children.', 'He wants to share his good ideas about money matters.', '.He thinks money management the most important for children.', ""Parents care  little  about their children's management of money.""]",What leads the writer to write this article?,"EAT YOUR VEGETABLES. Wash your hands. Always say ""please"" and ""thank you "".We are full of advice for our children, but when it comes to money, we often have little to say. As a result, our children may grow up with clean hands and good manners, but without any idea how to manage their money.Here are some basics that will help guide them their entire lives:
Show them the future. If your 13-year-old girl were to save $1.000,invest it at 8% and add $100 every month, by the time she's 65,she would have $980,983!zxxk
Be careful of credit .Credit cards can help you buy necessary things and build a credit history, but they must be used responsibly, which means paying off your debt in time. Explain to your children that when you buy something using a credit card, you can easily end up paying two or three times what you would have paid if you used cash.
Teach patience. Suppose your child wants a new bicycle that costs $150.Rather than paying the cash, give him some regular pocket money and explain that by putting aside,say,$15 each week, he will be able to buy it for himself in only ten weeks.
Provide _ . Tell your children the importance of saving. ""For every dollar he or she agrees to save and invest rather than spend, you agree to add another dollar to the pot, ""says Cathy Pareto, expert in money planning.
Explain your values. Values and money are deeply intertwined , says  Eilleen  Gallo, co-author of The Financially Intelligent Parent. When your child demands that you buy something, explain why you really don't want to buy it. ""You might say, 'I'd rather save that money for your education,'"" advises Gallo. Every time you spend or don't spend money, you have a chance to share your values.",high2028.txt
