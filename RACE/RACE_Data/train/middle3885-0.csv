0,D,"['It can walk and talk.', 'It can help me with my homework.', 'It can send me message.', 'It can travel back in time.']",An e-friend can do the following EXCEPT  _  .,"Life in the year 3044 is very different from life in the 21st century . We still do many of the things you did, but we do them differently. For example, we now have e-friends to help us and keep us company. An e-friend is a machine that looks just like a human being. It can walk and talk like humans and can do almost the same things as we human beings do. My e-friend is a lot like me and we have much fun together. She helps me with my homework and we often go swimming. She is computerized to take care of me in case   anything happens, so I always feel safe when we are together. She can also send me messages, just like old-fashioned e-mail, and I can download  information from her memory chip. It's so great to have an e-friend - I feel never lonely and I always have someone to talk to.
Actually, I would plan to tell you more about life in the year 3044, I have to send my e-friend to clean up my room, though. Maybe one day I will be able to fly back in time rocket and visit you and old friends. Looking forward to!",middle3885.txt
