2,B,"['The writer was really regretful for what he said.', ""The father's love was silent because it was in his heart."", 'Never shout to your father because it is wrong.', 'Time really flies so a child usually grows up quickly.']",What does the text mainly tell us?,"I used to think Dad didn't love me at all, because he never tried to hug or kiss me. But whenever I felt sad or lonely, Dad was always there.
When I was in high school, Dad retired  and set up a food _ on the street near my school. Every day when I finished school, my classmates and I would pass his food stand. But I really hated talking to Dad, because I did not want my classmates to know my dad was selling noodles on the street!
One night, I couldn't stand it any more and shouted, ""Dad, could you stop selling your stupid noodles? I don't need a father who sells noodles on the street!"" At that moment, Dad was shocked. He tried to say something but didn't. His eyes were filled with tears and sadness. It was the first time for me to see Dad crying. My mum later told me Dad was selling noodles to save money for my college  education. Even today I still feel guilty for that night.
Time really flies. I finished college and then left my home city. For the past ten years, whenever I visited home, Dad was always there meeting me and seeing me off quietly at the railway station. When I was away, Dad never wrote or called me, but he always pushed my mum to call me. That's the way Dad shows his love to me.
