2,A,"['Several months.', 'More than a year.', 'Several years.', 'Several hours.']",How long has Rikke probably been using the Screenfridge?,"When Rikke Dausen in prefix = st1 /Denmarkgoes to get some milk from the fridge, she has trouble getting past the refrigerator door. But it's not because of any physical obstruction. It's usually because the PC monitor in her refrigerator's door has informed her that a new email message has arrived.
       Rikke and her husband are taking part in a six-month trial sponsored by a Danish firm and two Swedish partners. They hope to show that computers can be put to much more practical daily use than most people think. Fifty families and singles were provided with a free model known as the ""Screenfridge"" for the duration of trial.
       ""It's really very clever"", says Rikke. She can call up email, news reports, sales items at the supermarket or addressed out of the endless ocean Internet possibilities. ""I'm not the type who wants to sit in front of the computer and wait 10 minutes for the modem to connect,"" she says.
       The creators of the Screenfridge aim at this type of buyer. They think the machine should attract people who have limited time to solve technical problems or surf online.
       The PC that is built into the door is very small. It is only two centimeters wide, and completely silent.
       ""Everything moves quickly"", as Rikke admits. ""Well, the whole thing is really just an amusement"", she says. ""But when the thing is gone after the test, it will be pain to have to go down in the basement again to download my email"".
       The Screenfridge is due to hit the market sometime next year.",high19289.txt
