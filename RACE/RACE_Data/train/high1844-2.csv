2,D,"['Hard to believe.', 'Interesting to read.', 'Very puzzling.', 'Very satisfying.']",How did the teacher think of the author's project?,"I have recently completed my college degree. The last project was called ""Smile"". The class was asked to go out to smile at three people and document their reactions. I am a very friendly person and always smile at everyone and say hello anyway. So, I thought this would be a piece of cake.
My husband, youngest son and I went out to McDonald. We were standing in line when all of a sudden everyone around us began to back away. As I turned around I smelled a horrible body odour  and saw two poor homeless men standing behind me. As I looked at the short blue-eyed gentleman closest to me, he was ""smiling"". The second man fumbled with his hands as he stood behind his friend.
The young lady at the counter asked him what they wanted. He said, ""Coffee is all, Miss,"" because that was all they could afford.
Then I really felt it-I embraced  the little man with the blue eyes. That is when I noticed all eyes in the restaurant were set on me, judging my every action. I smiled and asked two more breakfast meals on and gave them to the men.
The blue-eyed gentleman looked up at me, with tears in his eyes, and said, ""Thank you."" When I sat down my husband smiled at me. We held hands for a moment and at that time, we knew that because of the good fortune that we had been given.
I turned in my project. My teacher said, ""Can I share this?"" I slowly nodded as she got the attention of the class. She began to read and that is when I knew that we as human beings share this need to heal people and to be healed.
In my own way I had touched the people at McDonald's and every soul that heard the story in the classroom. But, I graduated with one of the biggest lessons I would ever learn.",high1844.txt
