1,C,"['success is the result of hard work', 'working hard will lead to success', 'their failure is only because of bad luck', ""they don't make efforts to succeed""]",Losers would think that   _   .,"From now on,never spend your time thinking of reasons for your failures and shortcomings.Instead,realize that the seeds of success were planted within you when you were born.Only you have the power to make those seeds grow.
The seeds,and the power to grow them,are contained in the most wonderful machine ever made:the human mind.Success is a choice and not a chance.You were born a winner.You were born rich.You can be a success if only you make the right choice.
You cannot be successful without first developing your self-esteem   .Your level of self-esteem is always based on the degree of control that you are able to exercise over yourself , and thus over your life.People with low self-esteem are people who do not believe that they have any power,or responsibility for their lives.They are the lasting victims   .They are leaves moved from side to side by the winds of chance blown about with any sudden change in the weather.
You can exercise control over your life only to the degree that you believe that you are responsible   for everything that happens in your life.Failures think that everything happens by accident and chance.Successful people realize that they are responsible.
Everything happens as a result of something.If we can find out the cause,we can control the effect.We are responsible for what we choose to think and believe.One generally rises to the level that one expects.We are responsible for setting our expectations.Our success is dependent upon our level of confidence  .
If you get along with positive-thinking people , you are definitely going to achieve success.On the contrary,the opposite happens.We are responsible for finding,planting,and taking care of the seeds that contain future victory, born from setbacks  .
In short,in all areas of your life,whether they are financial,physical,emotional,or spiritual,you are responsible.Once you recognize this,accept it,and firmly believe it,you are on the road to success.",high16713.txt
