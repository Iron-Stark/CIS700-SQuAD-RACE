from stress and exhaustion, according to a study. Scientists studied 12,000 employees aged
between 18 and 65.They found that those who traveled to work by car or public transport
reported higher levels of stress and tiredness compared to active commuters who traveled by foot
or bicycle. The negative health of public transport users increased with journey time.
      It is now expected that the study, from Lund University in Sweden, will encourage further
  investigation into the health effects of commuting and the best forms of transportation.
      Researcher Erik Hansson said:""Generally car and public transport users suffered more
  everyday stress, poorer sleep quality, exhaustion and felt that they struggled with their health
  compared to the active commuters.""
      According to the Office for National Statistics, the average Briton commutes 54 minutes
  every day.
      But now the scientists claim that the advantages of daily travel, such as higher pay or
  housing conditions, need to be weighed against the negative health effects. Income, family
background and environmental factors are other things that need to be considered.
    It may also have a cost effect on industry. According to a Absence and Workplace Health
  Survey, the U.K. economy lost 190 million working days to absence last year, with each
employee taking an average of 6.5 days off sick, costing employers US$27 billion.
    Hansson added that findings would help to reconsider the balance between economic needs,
health, and the costs of working days lost. However, researchers stress that the findings,
published in the journal BMC Public Health, do not prove that commuting causes ill health and
  further research is needed.",high21122.txt
