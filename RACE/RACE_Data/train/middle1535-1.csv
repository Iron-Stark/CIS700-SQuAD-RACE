1,B,"['Two', 'Three', 'Four', 'Five']",How many reasons why television has become the main educator are mentioned in the passage?,"Television has taken the place of schools as the main educator  in America. There are several reasons for this. First, there is the number of hours. While Americans spend about 13,000 hours in schools, they spend 15,000 to 16,000 hours in front of a TV set. Second is the age at which viewers  start watching TV. People start watching and understanding TV at about the age of 3, which is several years before they start to do school work. Finally, there is the number of viewers. About 90,000,000 young people are attending school, but most of the Americans watch TV every day. It seems, then, that TV shows are taking the place of teachers and professors as the educators in America.",middle1535.txt
