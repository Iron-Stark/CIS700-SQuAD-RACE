3,C,"['To discuss ways to make a list of terrible things.', 'To explain what is gratitude towards the storms of life.', ""To persuade people to be thankful for what didn't happen."", 'To show people different ways to consider their tough situations.']",What is the purpose of this passage?,"If practicing an attitude of gratitude  during the storms of life is too much for you right now, that's OK. When things are tough, most people have a hard time being thankful. They're so caught up in what's wrong in the present moment that they simply can't see some things are still right.
If that's true for you, then accept it. You're going through a particularly difficult or unhappy period of time, and you don't like it one bit. Very normal, very human. But remember this: there is always something to be grateful for. It maybe only a small comfort right now, but it is a start. Make a list of some of the terrible things that didn't happen. For example:
*You're in debt...but you're not homeless.
*You lost your job...but you didn't lose your health.
*You broke your leg...but you didn't break your neck.
*Your mother has Alzheimer's disease...but your father doesn't.
No matter how bad things are, they could always be worse. Start finding gratitude for what might have happened, but didn't. It does help a lot. Of course, you may not be thankful for everything-- but you can always be thankful for something.",high2667.txt
