2,A,"['the earth looks like a colored ball', 'we can enjoy the scenery on the moon', 'every inch of the moon is very hot', 'the extreme temperature breaks rocks away from the surface of mountains']",According to the passage we know that    _    .,"Science has told us too much about the moon that it is fairly easy to imagine what it would be like to get there.
