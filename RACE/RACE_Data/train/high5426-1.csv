1,C,"['The Relationship Between Virus and Cold', 'How to Sleep Well', 'Good Sleep Helps Fight a Cold', 'The More the Sleep, the Better Your Body']",What's the best title of the passage?,"People who averaged fewer than seven hours of sleep per night in the weeks before being exposed to the cold virus were nearly three times as likely to get sick as those who averaged eight hours or more, a new study found.
Researchers used frequent telephone interviews to track the sleep habits of more than 150 men and women aged 21 to 55 over the last few weeks. Then they exposed the _ to the virus, quarantined   them for five days and kept track of who got sick.
Besides sleeping more, sleeping better also seemed to help the body fight illness: Patients who fared better on a measure known as ""sleep efficiency""--the percentage of time in bed that you're actually sleeping--were also less likely to get sick.
The results held true even after researchers adjusted for elements such as body-mass index, age, sex, smoking and pre-existing antibodies   to the virus.
The researchers aren't exactly sure why sleeping better makes you less likely to develop a cold. But they do try to give an answer: ""Sleep disturbance influences the regulation of symptom mediators   that are released in response to infection."" In plain English, maybe tossing and turning when you're infected with the cold virus contributes to the symptoms that define a cold.
The researchers were based at Carnegie Mellon, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Virginia, and the study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",high5426.txt
