2,A,"['the power of words', 'the cruelty of the king', 'how to understand others', 'how to build good relationships']",The passage mainly talks about   _  .,"""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.""
You probably heard those lines in grammar school, but do you really agree that harsh  or negative words do not harm us? Words have power. Surely we all have had our feelings hurt by something someone said.
We may not say words to hurt others, but the way we interpret   them and how we say them may cause great harm. Here's an example
An ancient king dreamed all his teeth had fallen out. He sent for a wise man to explain his dream to him the dream means that all your relatives will die and you will be left alone! The king was very angry and threw the interpreter into prison. He then sent for another interpreter who said, ""Congratulations! King! You will live many more years. In fact, you will survive all your relatives. Long Live the King!""
Both interpreters gave the same interpretation, but there was a huge difference in the way they said it.
Our speech must be understood by those who hear our words, but the way we say things and the intention behind them have as much power as the words themselves. Words can cause anger or appreciation. Which would you rather receive?
People who say harsh and negative things may not mean to harm, but have you ever known anyone who is a _ ? They often look at the dark sides of things. They always see the glass as half empty rather than half full. How do you feel when you are around this type of person? Remember words have power. Use them wisely.",high12751.txt
