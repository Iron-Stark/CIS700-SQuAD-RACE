3,D,"[""Takashi isn't from Japan."", 'Kotatsu is a kind of Japanese food.', ""Takashi doesn't eat lunch with his teacher."", ""We can know Takashi's school from his clothes.""]",What can we learn from the passage?,"My name is Takashi. I am ten years old. I live in Tokyo, the capital of Japan. Now I'd like to tell you something about my school day.
In the morning I get up at seven, and I eat breakfast at half past seven at a table called a kotatsu. We usually sit on mats with our legs under the table.
After breakfast, I start going to school at ten to eight. I usually wear a yellow hat and a T-shirt. The clothes can tell other people my address and my school. I go to school from Monday to Friday and every other Saturday. When it's lunch time, we eat in our classroom. Our teacher eats with us, too. Sometimes we have sushi, a kind of popular Japanese food. Many people in Japan like it very much. We make it with rice, fish and eggs.
My school day is not easy, but most of us enjoy it because we want to have a good future.",middle6380.txt
