""If the automobile and aerospace technology had exploded at the same pace as computer and information technology,"" says Microsoft, ""a new car would cost about $ 2 and go 600 miles on a small quantity of gas. And you could buy a Boeing 747 for the cost of a pizza.""
Probably the biggest payoff, however, is the billions of dollars the Internet is saving companies in producing goods and serving for the needs of their customers.

Kids today are so computer literate that it in fact ensures the United States will remain the unchallenged leader in cyberspace for the foreseeable future. Nearly all children in families with incomes of more than $75,000 a year have home computers, according to a study by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. Youngsters from ages 2 to 17 at all income levels have computers, with 52% of those connected to the Internet. Most kids use computers to play games (some for 30 hours or more a week), and many teenage girls think nothing of rushing home from school to have e-mail chats with friends they have just left.
What's clear is that, whether we like it or not, the Internet is an ever growing part of our lives and there is no turning back. ""The Internet is just 20% invented,"" says cyber pioneer Jake Winebaum. ""The last 80% is happening now.""",high3450.txt
