2,B,"['Very lovely.', 'A little scary.', 'very friendly.', 'A little shy.']",What do you think of the dog according to the passage?,"Nancy was new to America. She had an 8-year-old son.
They found a house in New York. They were there for only two months when a neighbor's dog jumped into their yard. The dog ran toward Nancy's son. Nancy put her body in between the dog and her son. The dog stopped when it saw Nancy standing in front of it. She was going to hit   it on the nose. The dog turned around.
Shaking, Nancy took her son upstairs. They stayed in the house all the weekend. Then Nancy found another house. It was close to her son's school.
She and her son walked everywhere. They found there was a park and a supermarket near the house. Nancy was very happy. Her son Tommy liked playing badminton, and he could practice in the park every morning.",middle4930.txt
