1,A,"['On 15th May.', 'Three days ago.', 'Last year.', 'On a cold winter morning.']",When did they get to the hotel?,"Dear Sir,
I am writing to you about my stay at your hotel. My wife and I arrived on Saturday, 15thMay and stayed for a week. Though we were treated well and found the service excellent, we think there are one or two matters we should bring your attention.
1. We had hoped for a nice holiday from our busy work lives, and your advertisement said ""comfortable and quiet"". We want to have a chance to enjoy ourselves. However, we were always waken up by the noise every morning. Is it really necessary for the workers to start their repair work so early?
2. We had hoped to swim in your ""wonderful pool"". To our disappointment , we found that it was closed for the whole time of our stay.
I hope you do not mind my writing to you about these things, but I would be happy if you could give me some explanation. As I said at the start, it is a pity, and your service is so good in other fields.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Yours sincerely
Mr Hector Bradley
