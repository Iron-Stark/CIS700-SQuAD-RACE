3,C,"['his mother was right', 'his mother was friendly', 'his mother was naughty when she was young', 'he wanted to make his mother happy']","The last sentence ""You've told me the truth today, Mummy!"" means   _  .","Allan is eight this year and he's in Grade Two. The boy is clever and can answer all the questions in class. But he hates to stay in the classroom for more than half an hour. He would not listen to the teachers when class is soon going to be over. Or he touches his deskmate's head, or he makes faces. He often makes the whole Class laugh. His teachers tell his parents about it. He has to make a promise that he won't do that again. But soon he will forget it.
The teachers think he does well in his lessons and don't mind it.
One Saturday evening Allan finished his homework as soon as he had supper. He turned on the television, but there was no football match on TV.
He found all the programmes were not interesting and turned it off. He saw his sister Mabel doing her homework in her bedroom. He decided to play a joke on her. He found an earthworm   in the garden and put it in her clothes. The girl was so frightened that she cried out for help. Their mother heard this and went in to find out what had happened there. Of course, the boy was punished for it.
The next morning Mabel gave her mother a card and said, ""Merry Mother's Day. Mum!"" The woman was happy and thanked her daughter. But Allan had nothing to give his mother as a present. He felt sorry and said, ""Don't be angry with me Mummy. I've forgotten it. ""
""It doesn't matter, dear,"" said his mother. ""The best present is to be a good boy. Don't be naughty , my son, or your child will be naughty, too! ""
Hearing this, the boy began to laugh and said. ""You've told me the truth today, Mummy!""",middle5682.txt
