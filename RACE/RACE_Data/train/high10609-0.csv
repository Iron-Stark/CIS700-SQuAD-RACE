0,B,"['Travel to write a power wheelchair adventure.', 'Travel across Britain in a power wheelchair.', 'Prove she can do what a man can in driving.', 'Try a fast Formula One power chair sport.']",What is Mary Laver planning to do?,"Writer and power chair adventurer Mary Laver has not walked for twenty years. Yet the cheerful and positive 60 year old is not only refusing to let her disability get her down ---- she is also planning to cross the length of Britain in a power wheelchair.
Getting ready for the trip is not easy. She has already run into many problems - not least officials and organizations who view her as a health and safety risk. One police officer wrote to Mary requesting:
1. The proposed route through our area with road numbers.
2. The dates and times each day that this will be taking place.
3. The location details of the proposed overnight stops.
4. The names and mobile phone contact details of the Support Crew.
Another police officer asked her to travel off road! As Mary told me, this was unacceptable - as a power wheelchair user with limited movement _ "".
There are other problems in her way though - she is, after all, in her 60's and has severe rheumatoid arthritis . However, unlike many other people with arthritis, she is no longer in pain.
""When you are in a power chair and it is going at eight miles an hour, believe me it feels fast ... to me it is the Formula One  chair of electric wheelchairs.""
At the end of the interview, I asked Mary if she had a message for any other power chair users who wanted to do a challenge, and her reply was simple:""Just do it!""",high10609.txt
