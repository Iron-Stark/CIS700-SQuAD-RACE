1,B,"['35 years old', '38 years old', '45 years old', '80 years old']",How old was the father when he wrote down this page in the diary?,"An 80-year-old man was sitting on the sofa in his house along with his 45-year-old highly educated son.
Suddenly a crow perched on their window.
The father asked his son, ""What is this?""
The son replied, ""It is a crow.""
After a few minutes, the father asked his son the 2
time, ""What is this?""
The son said, ""Father, I have just now told you 'It's a crow'.""
After a little while, the old father again asked his son the 3
time, ""What is this?""
At this time some expression of
was felt in the son's tone when he said to his father. ""It's a crow, a crow, a crow.""
A little after, the father again asked his son the 4
time, ""What is this?""
This time the son shouted at his father, ""Why do you keep asking me the same question again and again, although I have told you so many times 'IT IS A CROW'. Are you not able to understand this?""
A little later the father went to his room and came back with an old tattered diary, which he had maintained since his son was born. On opening a page, he asked his son to read that page. When the son read it, the following words were written in the diary:
""Today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa, when a crow was sitting on the window. My son asked me 23 times what it was, and I replied to him all 23 times that it was a crow. I hugged him lovingly each time he asked me the same question again and again for 23 times. I did not at all feel irritated, I rather felt affection for my innocent child.""",high16331.txt
