0,D,"['None of them.', 'Only one.', 'Half of them.', 'All of them.']",How many students passed the exam at last?,"It was the last day of the final examination in a university. A group of students entered the classroom happily. This was their last exam. They knew it would
be easy. The professor had said that they could bring any book or note they wanted. The only requirement  was that they couldn't talk with each other.
The professor handed out the papers. They were glad to find there were only five questions. Three hours passed. The professor asked, ""How many of you have finished all the five questions?"" None of the students answered.
""How many of 3'ou have finished four?"" No answers again.
""Thee? Two?"" The students moved restlessly   in their seats.
""One, then? Certainly somebody has finished  one."" But the class remained silent.
""That is exactly what I expected,"" the professor said. ""I just want to teach you a lesson--although you have completed four years of study, there are still many
things you don't know about."" Then be added, ""You will all pass the exam, But remember: even though you are graduating from college, your education has just begun.""",middle2030.txt
