2,D,"['He is always being late.', 'He is always lying.', 'He is always breaking his words.', 'He is always keeping.']",Who can be your best friend?,"Do you want to make friends with others? Please remember to _ all the time. In this way, people around you will get along well with you.
To make friends and keep them, you have to keep your words. If you agree to meet someone at a certain time, you should arrive at the place on time or a little earlier. If you agree to help others, you must do it. Of course if there is something unexpected  happening and you can't do what you have agreed to do, your friends will understand this.
He is always lying or making excuses for breaking his words. Would you like to have him as one of your best friends? You wouldn't. And your own friends feel the same way.
So, be more careful when you have to agree to do something for your friends. Don't have ""Maybe""in your mind when you say something about what you are going to do.
