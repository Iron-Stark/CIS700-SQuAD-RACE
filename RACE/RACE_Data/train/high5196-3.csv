3,C,"['he was afraid of getting too old to start computing.', 'he did not enjoy school.', 'he wanted to work with computers.', 'he wanted to earn a lot of money.']",He left school after taking six O-levels because  _  .,"Computer programmer David Jones earned PS35,000 a year designing new computer games, yet he cannot find a bank prepared to let him have a check card, he has been told to wait another two years until he is 18.
He works for a small firm in Liverpool, where most young people of his age are finding jobs. David's biggest headache is what to do with his money. Though he has high payment, he cannot drive a car, or get credit card .
David got his job four months ago, a year after leaving school with six O-levels and working for a time in a computer shop. ""I got the job because the people who run the firm knew I had already written some programs,"" he said.
""I suppose PS35,000 sounds a lot but I hope it will come to more than that this year."" He spends some of his money on records and clothes, and gives his mother PS20 a week as he lives with his parents. But most of his spare time is spent working.
""Unfortunately, computing was not part of our studies at school, "" he said. ""But I had been studying it in books and magazines for four years in my spare time. I knew what I wanted to do and never considered staying on at school. Most people in this business are fairly young, anyway. I would like to earn a million and I suppose early retirement  is a possibility. You never know when the market might disappear.""",high5196.txt
