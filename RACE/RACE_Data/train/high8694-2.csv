I've always been making drams from time to time. Those dreams made by each average Chinese like me are certainly Chinese dreams. Dreams vary from person to person, an d also from time to time. But in a certain time, people share the similar dreams here I'd like to share my Chinese dreams with you.
When I was a child in 1970s, poverty kept hovering   over my family, just as it did with other average families in the countryside. The unfit  second-hand clothes, rain leaking roof of old adobe  house became part of my memory. However, the worse impression is that I was feeling hungry all the time. Sometimes hunger bit me so severely that I regarded dried sweet potato slices as a delicious snack. The sharp cracks of chewing are still echoing   in my dream. At that time, my dram was getting enough to fill my cooing empty belly.
In the early years of 1980s, as the reform and opening-up policy was carried out, the child dream came true. And then another dream became clearer and clearer in my mind. I must try my best to escape out of my poor and backward hometown. I worked harder at my study than most of my classmates, and, after luckily succeeding in the national college entrance examination, my dream became reality again: after graduation, I became a citizen working in a city. As the first college graduate out of a remote   village, my success set an example for my folks. They came to realize that schooling is a good way to change one's fate . In the following years, there were less drop-outs and more college graduates in my village, of which I am proud even today.
Afterwards, I got accustomed to the life of citizens and I began to dream the same things as other peers: a comfortable home, my own car and a big house. Based on my hard-work, more than ten years passed, all of these dreams have been fulfilled. Of course, new dreams will come true sooner or later only if my motherland keeps advancing with current(,)pace.
My Chinese dreams are also ones of other Chinese people. If every individual's dreams come true, the dream of the great rejuvenation  of the Chinese nation will be sure to come true. ""The Chinese dream, after all, is the dream of the people,"" as the Chairman Xi Jingping said.",high8694.txt
