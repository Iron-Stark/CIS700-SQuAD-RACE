It was very hot. How happy they were in the river! After they got out of the water, they played games in the sun for a while.
On their way back, Henry saw some flowers. He liked flowers very much and ran into the green field to look at them. Now Allan was walking by himself.
Then he heard Henry calling out, ""A snake ! Help!...""
""What's wrong with you?"" asked Allan.
""A snake bit me in the leg. Come here!""
Allan ran over and saw a small red wound on Henry' s leg.
""The snake was in the grass. I didn't see it.""
""Sit down quickly""! Allan told Henry.
Allan put his mouth at the little red wound and began to suck at it. In this way he saved  Henry's life. ""Oh, Allan, it's very kind of you to help me.""
""That's all right. We are friends and we must always help each other.""",middle575.txt
