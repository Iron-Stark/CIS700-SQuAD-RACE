2,C,"['Parents should worry about losing control over their children.', 'All generations should learn to be cooler by using the new language.', 'We should help children understand the difference between the hobby online and the standard language.', 'The authorities themselves should try to use the new language.']","What is the correct attitude we should take towards ""Martian language"" according to the psychologist?","The so-called post-90s generation have become even much ""cooler"" than the 1980s group, for they can speak ""Martian language"", a difficult code-like language created by themselves. And they probably think it very original and smart.
The idea of this language is to prevent the authorities- parents and teachers- from understanding what is said.
Ms. Li, mother of a 15-year-old girl, logged  onto her daughter's online space and found lines of codes, mixed English, Japanese and half-finished Chinese characters, which looked completely meaningless to her. Her daughter told her that it was ""Martian language"" and her  _ all used it.
The new language is becoming very popular in online spaces- so much so that even some translating software has been created to translate the normal language into ""Martian language"".
A 14-year-old netizen, nicknamed ""S. _ Tangguo"", explained that the language could be created by anyone. ""At first, I just copied the language form other people's articles. Later , I began to create some words by myself. I split  some Chinese characters, or use words that have similar pronunciations to interchange with each other, or even add some English, Japanese or Korean words into my article, and that makes the new language. My classmates all chat in 'Martian language'. It's in style and can help us hide our secrets from our parents or teachers.""
Unlike the worried parents, some experts have found positive aspects in the spread of this unusual online language. Wang Haiyong, a psychologist ,said that there's no need to be too worried about the phenomenon. This so-called ""Martian language"" is just a little hobby of the post-90s generation. On the other hand, the new language can inspire children's imaginations, which is a good thing. However, Wang also advised teachers and parents to give proper guidance to their children, helping them better distinguish between online language and the normative  language of real life.",high22024.txt
