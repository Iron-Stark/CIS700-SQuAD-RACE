1,A,"['An Angel Dog', 'A Helpful Couple', 'Saving the Dog', 'A Famous Song']",Which of the following is the best title for the passage?,"My wife Julie and I were out on the road that runs around where we live, when we saw an old worn-out dog stumbling   painfully up the road. We stopped, bent down, talked gently to the dog and patted it. I checked and there was a collar with a phone number. I called but no one answered.
The dog was painfully thin. So Julie ran home to get some of our dog's food while I tried to encourage the dog. After Julie came back, we sat down on the sidewalk while our new friend made short work of the food. Eventually we got her home.
After trying for many times we got a response from the number. A lady came around with a bunch of flowers for us. She explained that Tara had been her father's dog. She was very old and got lost that morning. So, Tara was safely returned home.
Here is the truth of the story:
Actually Julie and I were out that morning because I was leaving. She was trying to persuade me to come back, but I wasn't hearing anything that made that sound likely.
I was about to turn and go when an old black dog walked between us and almost fell down. Suddenly we had something more important than _ to worry about. There was a creature in need right before us and we had to work together to help it.
We did help it. And here I am writing the story in my own home, in my own family.
In the song ""Love Is Not a Fight"" Warren Barfield talks about marriage. At one point he sings, ""And if we try to leave, may God send angels   to guard the door.""
Sometimes angels come disguised   as dogs.",high5852.txt
