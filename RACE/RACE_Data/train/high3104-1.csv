1,D,"['play a trick on him', ""own a car like Paul's"", 'pick up someone important to him.', 'show off by riding home in a car']","When the boy asked for a ride home, Paul thought the boy wanted to   _  .","A fried of mine named Paul received an automobile from his brother as a Christmas present. On Christmas Eve when Paul came out of his office, a naughty street boy was walking around the shiny new car, admiring it. ""Is this your car, Mister?"" he asked..
Paul nodded, ""My brother gave it to me for Christmas."" The boy was surprised. ""You mean your brother gave it to you and it didn't cost you anything? I wish..."" He hesitated .
Of course Paul knew what he was going to wish for. He was going to wish he had a brother like that. But what the boy said made Paul think all the way.
""I wish ,"" the boy went on, ""that I could be a brother like that.""
Paul looked at the boy in surprise, adding, ""Would you like to take a ride in my automobile?""
""Yes, I'd love that."" After a short ride, the boy turned and said, ""Mister, would you mind driving in front of my house?""
Paul smiled, He thought he knew what the boy wanted. But Paul was wrong again. ""Will you stop where those two steps are?"" the boy asked.
He ran up the steps. Then in a while Paul heard him coming back, but he didn't come fast. He was carrying his little crippled  brother. He pointed to the car and said, ""There it is, Buddy, just like I told you up stairs. His brother gave it to him for Christmas. And some day I'm going to give one just like it and then you can see for yourself all the pretty things in the Christmas windows that I've been trying tell you about. ""
Paul got out and lifted the boy to the front seat. The shining-eyed older brother climbed in beside him and the three of them began a memorable holiday ride.
That Christmas Eve, Paul learned what ""It is more blessed to give"" means.",high3104.txt
