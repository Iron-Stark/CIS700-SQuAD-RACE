You may have heard of Fred Lebow. He complained to his doctor that he lacked energy. His doctor advised him to take up running. He fell in love with it! He was 39 years old when he entered his first race.
Fred joined the New York Road Runners Club and organized New York City's first marathon race. But what Fred truly wanted to do was to bring people together. He believes that anybody should be able to run -- people of all ages and of any country.
Not everyone in New York was excited about people running through their neighborhood. A youth gang warned him that nobody had better run through their turf. ""That's great,"" Fred said. ""I need someone to protect the runners in your area, and you look like just the fellows to do it.""
