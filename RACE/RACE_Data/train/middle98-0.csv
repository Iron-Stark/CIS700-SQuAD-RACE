Many years ago there was a ver dog. His name was Seeing Eye dog. Now we can see this kind of dogs all over the world. They are working for the blind. The Seeing Eye dog is strong ,good and easy to train .He helps the blind to walk from place.
Before a dog becomes a Seeing Eye dog, he must go to a training school for about three months. First the dog has to learn to sit or stay when he hears the trainer's call. In his next lesson the dog learns to make his trainer across busy streets.
The dog has many things to learn. And in every lesson he must do one thing again and again many times.
At the end of the training schooled must take tests. When he passes the tests, the Seeing Eye dog will do things by himself.
