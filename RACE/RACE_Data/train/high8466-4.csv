4,D,"['The possession is too heavy to hold.', ""There's no more precious thing for us to hold."", ""It's not necessary to hold the possession."", ""The present contained with children's love and kisses is the most precious thing.""]","What's the meaning of the last sentence--""There is no more precious possession anyone could hold.""?","Some time ago, a friend of mine punished his three-year-old daughter for wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight , and he became infuriated when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree. Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, ""This is for you, Daddy."" He was embarrassed by his earlier over-reaction, but his anger flared again when he found that the box was empty.
He shouted at her loudly, ""Don't you know that when you give someone a present, there's supposed to be something inside of it?""
The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and said, ""Oh, Daddy, it's not empty. I blew kisses in the box. I filled it with my love. All for you, Daddy.""
The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl, and he begged her for forgiveness . My friend told me that he kept that gold box by his bed for years. Whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it there.
In a very real sense, each of us as parents has been given a gold container filled with unconditional love and kisses from our children. There is no more precious possession anyone could hold.",high8466.txt
