1,D,"[""Because Ghanaian people don't like cars."", 'Because most Ghanaian people are very rich.', 'Because Ghanaian people have to use bikes to carry food and goods.', 'Because a bike is cheaper and people like to use bikes to carry things.']",Why are bikes very popular in Ghana?,"As we all know, bikes are mainly made of steel . But can you imagine that they can be made of bamboo? Do you want to know how a bamboo bike is produced? Do you want to make your own bike with bamboo? You can do it at the Bamboo Bike Studio  in New York. People there can teach you how to make your own bamboo bike.
The studio is also helping build factories in Ghana , which is a country in western Africa. The factories will make cheap bamboo bikes.
Bamboo is as good as steel for building a good bike. Marty Odlin works at the studio. He says a bamboo bike is the wonderful everyday bike.
In Ghana, bikes are very popular. Few people have money to buy a car. And people like to use bikes to carry most of the country's food and other goods.
The people of Ghana are also too poor and they can't build factories to make traditional steel bikes. But making bamboo bikes is cheap. Odlin is planning to show the Ghanaian workers how to quickly make bamboo bikes now. He hopes that more and more Ghanaian people can have bamboo bikes.",middle6132.txt
