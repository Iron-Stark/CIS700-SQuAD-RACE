GO RIGHT AHEAD:
GOLDEN RULE: Home is pretty much the only place where you can safely blab   about anything without having to consider the needs of the people around you.
HANDLE WITH CARE in these places:
Waiting rooms: People here tend to be feeling anxious about their news --- not yours.
Shopping: Chatting while you're in line will slow down checkout and make other shoppers angry.
GO RIGHT AHEAD: Make calls quickly and quietly, and be respectful of those forced to listen.
DON'T DO IT in these places:
Museums/libraries/churches:
There are places we go for peace and quiet --- it's not proper to disturb others.
Movies and plays:
People pay to hear someone other than you perform.
Elevators/ bathrooms/ beauty salons/ public transportation:
No one around you can escape. Why force them to listen to your chitchat?
Restaurants:
People come here partly to get away from ringing phones and enjoy their conversations , so don't subject them to yours.
GO RIGHT AHEAD: Put your phone on vibrate   if you must get a call but always wait until you are outside before you start talking.
While driving a car:
It's rude to put other drivers in danger. So instead of going by the Golden Rules above, use a voice-activated phone  --- and use it as little as possible. You are four times as likely to get into a car accident if you're on the phone while you're driving.
Hang up already:
How to politely ask that loud cell-take to speak softly:
If you're in a place that has a manager, ask him or her to do  _ . Otherwise, put on your sweetest smile, tap the offender   on the shoulder, and try one of these carefully worded lines:
""Would you please end your call? I can't hear what they're saying?""
(Try this when you're watching movies and plays.)
""Excuse me, but you're making it really hard for me to concentrate  .""
(Good for museums, libraries, and places of worship.)
""Is it possible for you to speak a little more softly? I have a bad headache.""
(This will usually work just about anywhere.)",high20751.txt
