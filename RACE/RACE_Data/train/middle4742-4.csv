4,A,"['The writer likes to take a train because it takes a little more time.', 'The writer likes travelling by plane.', 'The writer thinks it takes a lot of time to go to and get out of the airport.', 'The writer likes to take a car because he has a car.']",Which of the following sentences is true according to the passage?,"Many people like to travel by plane, but I don't like it because the airport is usually far from the city. You have to get there early and wait for hours for the plane to take off. You can't open the windows. You can't choose the food. Planes are fast, but it still takes hours to get out of the airport and into the city.
I like travelling by train. I think trains are safe. Railway stations are usually good in cities. When you are late for a train, you can catch another one. You can walk around in the train and open the window. You can see many interesting things on your way, though it takes a little more time.
I also like cars. You can start your journey whenever you want to, and you don't need to get to a railway station or a bus stop. Also you can carry many things with you in a car. But sometimes there are too many cars on the road.
