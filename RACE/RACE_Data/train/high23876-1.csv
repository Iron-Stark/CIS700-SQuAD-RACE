Doctors showed their doubt and were strongly opposed although they admit that human cloning would finally come true unless there was a world wide ban on the practice.
       Professor Rudolf Jaenisch of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says,""I find it astonishing that people do this where the result can be foretold that it will not be a normal baby.It is using humans as guinea pigs.It makes people feel sick.""But Ronald Green,director of the Ethics institute at Darmouth College in the US,said it is unlikely that an eight-week-old pregnancy would lead to a birth.
