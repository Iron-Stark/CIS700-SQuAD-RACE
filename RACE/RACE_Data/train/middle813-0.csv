0,B,"['It has no teachers.', 'It has no school buildings.', 'It has only girl students.', 'It is the only school in the city.']","What can we learn about""City-as-School""?","Now, there is a new-type school in New York, which has no everyday lessons, no class teachers and even no school buildings. It is called ""City-as-School"". The name just means the city itself is the place where students learn their lessons. They are from the age of 15 to 18. The students choose areas of work which interest them. Then they help to do that work. One girl spends her week in a government office helping the public with problems like housing. Then she goes to help in a theatre for a day and she spends a week for first-year courses at college.
Well, students have to pass Maths and science exams before they enter the ""school"". These subjects are not easy to provide in""City-as-School"". Teachers watch the progress of the students. The success rate   is high. 80% of the students go to college after the ""City-as-School"".
The students like the duty of their work. They have the sense of purpose. They know a lot about different kinds of work in the city. One of the students, Lizette Martinez, writes "" I want to say that I do not know where I would be right now if I had never become part of City-as-School. Leaving my regular high school and going to City-as-School was the best decision I have ever made. The way the school works to get you to go out there and learn different fields instead of sitting in a classroom is wonderful. For all those who are in between school and dropping out, go to CAS and it will change your life forever.""
City-as-School High School is the nation's leading   external   learning or experiential   learning model for high school students.",middle813.txt
