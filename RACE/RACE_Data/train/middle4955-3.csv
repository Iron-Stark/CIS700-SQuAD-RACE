3,A,"['In a newspaper.', 'In a shop.', 'In a library.', 'In a bank.']",Where does the writer work most probably?,"To write a great news story, you have to make sure it is correct, relevant   and fresh.
For a start, all the information in a story must be correct. Not only the spelling and grammar, but also the facts.
Any mistakes that show up in a story can get a newspaper into big trouble.
For example, if a newspaper said that Yang Liwei was the first man to go into space, it would be wrong. He wasn't the first. The newspaper would probably lose lots of readers because of that mistake.
A news story does not only have to be correct, but it must also be relevant to its readers. People are mostly interested in news that happens near to them. That's why you care more about what happens at your school than at schools in America. It's also why newspapers in Beijing don't talk much about news in Shanghai or Hong Kong.
Make sure it's fresh.
Finally, news must always be fresh. When you pick up your evening newspaper, you want to read about news that happened that day. You don't want to read about news from last week!
So, now you know what makes a good news story. Have a look at our paper and see if it's full of good news! You can try writing a news story for our paper like a real reporter.",middle4955.txt
