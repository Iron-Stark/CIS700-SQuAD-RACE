1,C,"[""you shouldn't make any mistakes"", 'you must speak slowly', ""it doesn't matter if you make any mistakes"", 'you had better take a dictionary with you']","When you are speaking,   _  .","In learning English, one should first pay attention to listening and speaking.It is the groundwork of reading and writing.You'd better try your best to speak while you do much listening.Don't be afraid of making mistakes.But be careful not to let them stop you from improving your English.While you are doing this, a good way is to write---keep a diary, write notes or letters, and then if you can, ask someone else to go through what you have written and tell you what is wrong.Many mistakes in your speaking will be easily found when you write.Through correcting the mistakes, you can do better in learning English.
If you are slow in speaking, don't worry.One of the helpful ways is reading, either aloud or to yourself.The important thing is to choose something interesting to read.It mustn't be too difficult for you.When you are reading in this way, don't stop to look up the words if you can guess their meanings, or they have nothing important to do with the sentence.You can look them up later.",middle1130.txt
