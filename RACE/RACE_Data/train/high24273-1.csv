1,B,"['red', 'black', 'yellow', 'green']","When you are feeling sad, you'd better not wear_.","Our clothes are a powerful tool that can make us feel better about ourselves. One way in which this works is by wearing different color1s of clothes.
Normally when we are sad, we will wear dark color1ed clothes. Oppositely, when we are happy, we often choose to wear brightly color1ed clothes. The reason for this is that our choice of color1 mirrors is how we are feeling.
Those who don't believe in the idea are often heard saying, ""if only this truly worked"". Well in reply to those people, there has been a lot of research into what happens to someone's feelings when they are asked to wear just one color1 of clothes. It has been proven that if we wear particular color1s of clothes they can change our feelings.
Suppose we are feeling sad, if we wear black we may begin to feel worse. However, if we wear green, red or yellow, we may begin to feel better.
Each color1 is said to have its own healing power. So remember, if you are not feeling your best, you can always try out some different color1ed clothes. If one color1 has no effect on your feelings, maybe another will.",high24273.txt
