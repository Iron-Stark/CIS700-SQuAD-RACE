4,D,"['British and American English will be two different languages some day', 'Englishmen and Americans will never need an interpreter while talking', 'there will be no more differences between British and American English', 'the differences between British English and American English will grow larger']",At the end of the passage the writer wants to tell us    _   .,"Englishmen speak British English and Americans speak American English. A student is learning to speak British English. He often asks himself, ""Can Americans understand me when I speak British English?"" Learners often ask ""What's the difference between British English and American English?""Certainly there are some differences between British and American English. The Englishmen say ""Have you a pen?"" While Americans say ""Do you have a pen?"" The pronunciation is sometimes different. Americans often sound ""r"" in words like ""bird"" and ""hurt"". The British speakers don't sound the ""r"" in these words. There are differences in spelling. For example, ""colour"" and ""neighbour"" are British while ""color"" and ""neighbor"" are American. These differences in grammar, pronunciation and spelling are not important, however. For the most part, British and American English are the same language. When Englishmen and Americans are talking with each other, they don't need an interpreter . Maybe some day they need, but not now.",high15571.txt
