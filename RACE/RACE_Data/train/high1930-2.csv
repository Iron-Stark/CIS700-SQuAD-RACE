2,D,"['That light would be directed up into the sky.', 'That the sky would always be as dark as possible.', 'That people could see the night sky without light pollution as our ancestors did.', 'That people could spend time enjoying the beauty of the sky every night.']",What is Jennifer Barlow's wish?,"The National Dark-Sky Week (NDSW) is a week during which people all over the United States turn off their lights to enjoy the beauty of the night sky without light pollution. This even was started by Jennifer Barlow of Midlothian, Virginia in 2003, and it is becoming more popular each year. It has been supported by the International Dark-Sky Association, the American Astronomical Society, and the Astronomical League.
This even always occurs in April, during the week of the new moon so that the sky can be as dark as possible for the best viewing conditions.
""It is my wish that people could see the night sky without other light in the sky as our ancestors   saw it hundreds of years ago,"" explains Barlow.
 _ The main goal of NDSW is to increase awareness   of the harmful effects of light pollution. It is not possible for all of the light pollution in this part of the world to disappear. However, it is possible to make a small difference in the quality of the night sky. Another goal of this even is to promote   the use of better lighting systems that direct light toward the ground instead of up into the sky.
Jennifer Barlow states, ""The night sky is a gift of such beauty that it should not be polluted by wasted light. In this way, our children will not lose touch with the wonder of our universe.""",high1930.txt
