My year in the USA was full of fun. I like speaking to others, so I got lots of speaking practice. I also learned lots of interesting things about America. When I got home, my friends said I was better! I hope to go back to America again in the future.
Carla Fonseca - Rio de Janeiro
I spent last year studying English in London. There were so many people to talk to there, but I always felt bad about my English. I missed my family very much. I think it was great to study in London, but I'm glad to be at home!
Alvin Chen - Hong Kong
Studying in New Zealand was lots of hard work! I had English classes six hours a day, five days a week. I also kept a diary. I like writing, and I wrote about many things in my diary every day. On Saturdays, my homestay   family took me to lots of interesting places and showed me so many wonderful things. I was really glad to stay there for a year!",middle6905.txt
