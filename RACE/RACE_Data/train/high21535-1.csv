1,B,"['Crossword puzzles.', 'Nutrition additives.', 'Grains and vegetables.', 'Playing basketball and running.']",Which of the following is NOT helpful to the memory?,"Many expensive nutrition additives   advertised on TV say they can improve your memory. But only ordinary food and healthy habits have been shown to work.
A research team from UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) has designed a four-step plan to improve your memory in just 14 days.
""It sounds like another advertisement, but it really works,"" says UCLA psychiatry   professor Gary Small.
The team found the four-step plan improved memory function   in teenagers under stress and older people. After a two-week study that included brain-teasers  , exercise and diet changes, test subjects' memories worked more efficiently.
Here's the programme:
Memory training: Train yourself with brain-teasers, crossword puzzles and memory exercises that train verbal   skills throughout the day.
Healthy diet: Eat five rather than three meals a day. The food should be rich in omega-3 fats (omega-3), such as whole grains and vegetables that contain antioxidants  . Having frequent meals helps increase blood glucose  , the primary energy source for the brain.
Physical fitness: Have regular physical exercise such as walking, basketball or running, every day.
Stress reduction  : Perform stretching and relaxation exercises. Stress causes the body to release a chemical that can shrink   the memory centres in the brain.
Before-and-after brain scans showed that test subjects experienced on average a 5 per cent increase in working memory. This suggests they were using their brains more efficiently. They also performed better on a cognitive   test.
A control group that didn't follow the plan showed no big changes.
""We've known for years that diet and exercise can help people keep their physical health, which is a key part of healthy aging,"" said Small. ""But keeping mental health is just as important. Now we have evidence that people can improve their memories through a programme of memory exercises and stress reduction.""",high21535.txt
