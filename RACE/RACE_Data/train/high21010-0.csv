This voyage changed his life.
He decided to stay when Columbus returned. Ponce was named governor of Puerto Rico (then called Boriquien) in 1508.
While there, he heard many stories of a magical water source. People called it the Fountain of Youth and said that drinking its water kept you young.

On April 2, he landed at what he named St. Augustine. This was the first Spanish settlement on the mainland of North America.

He continued to govern tile island, and he continued to hear stories of the Fountain of Youth. Finally, in 1521, he set out again.
This time, he landed on the Florida coast again. While he and his men were building houses for a new settlement, they were attacked by native tribesmen .
