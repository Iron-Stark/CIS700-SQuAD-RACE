2,C,"['a news report', 'a science fiction', 'a novel', 'a review']",The passage is most probably adapted from  _  .,"My first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening near my parents' tomb in the churchyard. 
 ""Hold your noise!"" came a terrible voice, as a man started up from among the tombs at the side of the church. ""Keep still, you little devil , or I'll cut your throat!""
A fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg. A man with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his head. He seized me by the chin .
""Tell us your name!"" said the man. ""Quick!""
""Pip, sir.""
""Show us where you live,"" said the man. ""Point out the place!""
I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the alder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.
The man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread. 
""You young dog,"" said the man, licking his lips, ""what fat cheeks you ha' got. Darn me if I couldn't eat em, and if I han't half a mind to't!""
I earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn't, and held tighter to the tombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it; partly, to keep myself from crying.
""Now then lookee here!"" said the man. ""Where's your mother?""
""There, sir!"" said I.
He started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.
""There, sir!"" I timidly explained, pointed to the tombstone. ""That's my mother.""
""Oh!"" said he, coming back. ""And is that your father alonger your mother?""
""Yes, sir,"" said I; ""him too; late of this parish .""",high23194.txt
