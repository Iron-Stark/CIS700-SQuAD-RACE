However, most people with active tuberculosis do not expel (,)very many TB bacteria. So, the spread of the disease usually does not happen unless a person spends a large amount of time with a TB patient. Those most at risk are family members, friends and people who live or work closely with a patient.
Tuberculosis can attack any part of the body. However, the lungs are the most common targets  of the bacteria. People with the disease show several signs. They may expel air from the lungs suddenly with an explosive  noise. This kind of cough continues for a long period of time. People with a more severe case of tuberculosis also may cough up blood.
People with the disease often have high body temperatures. They suffer what are called night sweats, during which their bodies release large amounts of water through the skin. TB victims also are tired all the time. They are not interested in eating. So their bodies lose weight.
One thing that is especially dangerous about TB is that people with moderate  signs of the disease may not know they have had it. They may spread the disease to others without even knowing it. So, it is very important for people to get tested for tuberculosis.",high16311.txt
