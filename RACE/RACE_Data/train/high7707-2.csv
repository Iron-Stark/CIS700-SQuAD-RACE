2,C,"['there are more husbands who did the housework than wives', 'husbands do half of the housework all the time', 'there are more wives who do the housework than husbands', 'wives do almost all the housework at home']",From the passage we can see that   _  .,"How many men do housework? Recently a European commission  tried to find out people's ideas and reactions to the women's movement. As part of their survey , they asked many men and women the question, ""Who does the housework?"" The men answered very differently from the women!
The housework they asked people about was: preparing meals, washing dishes, cleaning the house and babysitting. 48% of British husbands said they did these things. 37% of Danish  men helped in the house. But only 15% of Italian men said they did the housework; many of them said they never helped at all!
But there was an interesting point of view from the wives. According to British wives, only 38% of their husbands helped in the house. And Italian wives said that their husbands hardly ever helped. The Italian and British men did not tell the truth! The Commission found that Danish men were the most truthful husbands; their answers were the same as their wives' answers.
Do the men you know help in the house? Do you think the survey gives a true picture in your experience? Write and tell us what you think.",high7707.txt
