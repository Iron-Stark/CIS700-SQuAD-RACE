""If you try to kill a bat, you are more likely to get bitten,"" said Joy O'Keefe, assistant professor of biology and director of Indiana State University's Centre for Bat Research, Outreach and Conservation. ""Most bats people find in their houses are healthy and are not going to bite them and give them rabies."" But they could be a federally endangered species, such as the Indiana Bat, which is found in this area.
So if you spot a bat in your home or office, don't kill it or touch it with bare hands, O'Keefe said. Instead, put on a pair of heavy gloves and gently move it into a box or bucket. Once contained, the bat can be removed outside.
""If it's a healthy bat, it'll fly away eventually,"" O'Keefe said. ""If it doesn't move or seem to be healthy, you can take it to the health department to be tested.""
This is the time of year when bats move from their summer resting sites to their winter resting sites, O'Keefe said.
""We get calls every year during the first month of school year from people finding bats in the university's buildings,"" said O'Keefe.
Bats are a great help to people, as every night they can eat up to their entire body weight of insects. Bats, however, are facing great threats from epidemics , habitat destruction and other things.
""The best way the average person can help bats is by understanding them and by telling other people how awesome bats are and what bats do for us,"" O' Keefe said. ""Hopefully, _ will make people think that if there's a bat in their house, they should try to get it out but not kill it. That would be really positive for bats--to not have people be one of their major threats.""",high14846.txt
