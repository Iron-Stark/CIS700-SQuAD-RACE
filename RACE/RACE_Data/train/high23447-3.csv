3,B,"['Street names in Japan can clearly tell you the way.', ""A person's body language can help you find out directions."", 'People in Yucatan usually lead you to the place where you want to go.', 'If you want to avoid getting lost in Greece, you should learn Greek first.']",Which of the following is TRUE according to the text?,"I have a rule of travel: never carry a map. I prefer to ask for directions. Foreign visitors are often puzzled in Japan because most streets there don't have names. In Japan, people tell landmarks in their directions instead of street names. For example, the Japanese will say to travelers, "" Go straight down to the corner. Turn left at the big hotel and pass a fruit market. The post office is across from the bus stop.""
In the countryside of the American Midwest, usually there are not many landmarks. There are no towns or buildings within miles. Instead of landmarks, people will tell you directions and distance. In Kansas or Iowa, for example, people will say, "" Go north two miles, turn west, and then go another mile.""
People in Los Angeles, California, have no idea of distance on the map. They measure distance by means of time, not miles. ""How far away is the post office?"" you ask. ""Oh,"" they answer, ""it's about five minutes from here."" You say, "" Yes, but how many miles away is it?"" They don' t know.
People in Greece sometimes do not even try to give directions because visitors seldom understand the Greek language. Instead of giving you the direction, a Greek often says, "" Follow me."" Then he will lead you through the streets of the city to the post office.
Sometimes a person doesn't know the answer to your question. What happens then? A New Yorker might say, "" Sorry, I have no idea."" But in Yuchatan, Mexico, no one answers "" I don't know."" People in Yucatan think that "" I don't know"" is impolite. They usually give an answer, often a wrong one. A visitor can get very lost in Yucatan.
 However, one thing will help you everywhere---- in Japan, in the United States, in Greece, in Mexico, or in any other places. You might not understand a person's words, but maybe you can understand his body language. He or she will usually turn and then point in the correct direction. Go in that direction and you may find the post office.",high23447.txt
