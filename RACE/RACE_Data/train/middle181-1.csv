1,D,"['Watch English films.', 'Write down the words first.', 'Listen to real English songs.', 'Take a deep breath and smile before you begin.']",What should you do if you are shy to speak English?,"Many students ask for advice about improving their English. There are three basic questions.
The first question is about real English. Li Hao from Hubei wrote, ""I enjoy watching English films and listening to real English songs. But it takes a long time. What do you think?""
This is a great way to learn English! Talk about the film or song with your friends, and guess the meaning of the new words. Just enjoy yourself!
The second question is about speaking. Sam, from Suzhou wrote. ""Our school has a foreign teacher. But I'm shy and can't speak to her. What should I do?""
When I visit China, lots of people in the street say, ""Hello! How are you? Where are you from? Do you like China?"" These are good questions to start a talk. Many people are shy when they speak English, so before you begin, take a deep breath and smile! Smiling always helps.
The third question is about vocabulary. Oliver, from Anhui wrote, ""I want to remember all the new words. I write them down, but I forget them quickly. What should I do?""
Try to remember eight or ten words a day. Write them on pieces of paper and place them in your bedroom. Say the words when you see them, and change them every day. And when you're  shopping, how about counting the English words, or saying the English names for everything you see?",middle181.txt
