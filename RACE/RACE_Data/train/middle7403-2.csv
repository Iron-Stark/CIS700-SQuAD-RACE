2,B,"['One-child policy has its advantages and disadvantages.', ""It's easy for a young couple to look after an old couple."", 'China is a great country with the largest population in the world.', 'For some families,maybe the parents are only child and they also can have only child before 2016.']","According to the passage,which of the following is NOT true?","China is a great country with the largest population in the world.In order to solve the population problem,our governmentcarried outone-child policy  before.When it is carried out for some time,many people not only see its advantages but also disadvantages.
From 2016,two-child policy is put into effect.In my opinion,two-child policy is good.First of all,two-child policy is the gift for some only child.For some families,maybe the parents are only child and they also can have only child.Besides the loneliness of their child,when their child grows up and they grow older,their child marry an only child girl,the burden on their child and his wife is too heavy.Their child and his wife have to take care of two couples.Usually,a young couple looking after an old couple is a little difficult.But if their parents have two children,they can share the burden of taking care of their parents.It would be much better.Secondly,two-child policy can guarantee   the number of Chinese population.
All in all,one-child policy has been out of date.And two-child policy is needed and necessary.It can solve the problems of nowadays  and the future.",middle7403.txt
