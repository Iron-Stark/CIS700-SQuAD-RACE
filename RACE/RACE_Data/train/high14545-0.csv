0,D,"['a manager in a station', 'a football player', 'a manager in a sports department in Dixon', 'a sports announcer']",The author dreamt of becoming   _  .,"""Everything happens for the best,"" my mother said whenever I faced disappointment. ""If you carry on, one day something good will happen. And you'll realize that it wouldn't have happened if not for that previous disappointment.""
Mother was right, as I discovered after graduating from college in 1932. I had decided to try for a job in radio, then work my way up to sports announcer. I hitchhiked to Chicago and knocked on the door of every station and got turned down every time.
In one studio, a kind lady told me that big stations couldn't risk hiring an inexperienced person. ""Go out in the sticks  and find a small station that'll give you a chance,"" she said.
I thumbed home to Dixon, Illinois. While there was no radio-announcing job in Dixon, my father said Montgomery Ward had opened a store and wanted a local athlete to manage its sports department. Since Dixon was where I had played high school football, I applied. The job sounded just right for me. But I wasn't hired.
My disappointment must have shown. ""Everything happens for the best,"" Mom reminded me. Dad offered me the car to job hunt. I tried WOC Radio in Davenport, Iowa. The program director, a wonderful Scotsman named Peter MacArthur, told me they had already hired an announcer.
As I left his office, my frustration boiled over. I asked aloud, ""How can a fellow get to be a sports announcer if he can't get a job in a radio station?""
I was waiting for the elevator when I heard MacArthur calling, ""What was that you said about sports? Do you know anything about football?"" Then he put me before a microphone and asked me to broadcast an imaginary game.
On my way home, as I have many times since, I thought of my mother's words: ""If you carry on, one day something good will happen. Something wouldn't have happened if not for that previous disappointment.""
I often wonder what direction my life might have taken if I'd gotten the job at Montgomery Ward.",high14545.txt
