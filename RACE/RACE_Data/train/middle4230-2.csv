2,C,"['everything', 'money', 'nothing', 'computers']",Volunteers want to get   _   when they help others.,"Are you looking for something fun and would you like to help other people in your spare time? Then join us to be a volunteer  .
We are a non-profit organization  . We have volunteer jobs for people of all ages. Anyone, from twelve-year-old children to people in their 80s, can become a volunteer.
You can help people in many ways. Schools need help with taking care of children when their parents are working. Hospitals need volunteers to look after children when their parents see a doctor. Animal lovers can help take care of those dogs and cats without homes. There is something for everyone.
""As a volunteer, I don't want to get anything. Seeing the children's happy faces, I am happy, too.""says Carlos Domingo, an old woman of 62.
If everyone helps a bit, we'll have a better world to live in.
