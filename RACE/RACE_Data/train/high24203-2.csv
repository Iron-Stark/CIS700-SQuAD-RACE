2,B,"['Council members.', 'Police officers.', 'Local people.', 'Drug users.']",Which group of people support camera use most?,"The Rockford police chief and some city officials want to install   video cameras in all 100 police cars. They think this will reduce the number of lawsuits  . In the last five years, Rockford has paid out more than five million dollars to settle about 40 lawsuits. 
The chief said, ""If cameras had been in those cars, we wouldn't have had to pay one cent. We're always pulling over drunks or drug users who try to fight the police or shoot them. Then they always claim   that the police start beating them first or start shooting at them first."" 
The cost of installing cameras will be about $500 each. The city council   will vote on the proposal   next Monday. Ten of the 13 council members said that they like the idea. One member said that it makes good sense. 
The police officers enthusiastically support camera use. One officer said that too many people think the police often lie; cameras would show citizens that police tell the truth. ""The money that we've been spending on lawsuits will be better spent on more cameras,"" said one officer. 
Citizen opinions to the idea of police car cameras are mixed. One person said that the police should have started doing this years ago when video cameras were invented. But an elderly man strongly objected. ""These police are trying to stick their nose into everything,"" he said. He was going to attend the council meeting to condemn the proposal. He hoped that other citizens would join him.",high24203.txt
