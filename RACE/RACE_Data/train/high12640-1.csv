Same spelling, different meaning
Imagine, then a situation where two words are spelt and pronounced exactly the same way, but have completely different meanings.Welcome to the world of homonyms.Take, for example, the word 'fail' --- it can be a kind of festival, and adjective to describe the color of your hair or how you should play a game.
Don't take it literally
So how do you know which meaning someone is referring to? --- You don't, except by the context.Obviously, if someone asks you to 'give them a hand', they don't want you to remove what is at the end of your arm.
What's in a name?
Sometimes even the context doesn't help much --- the result can be amusing.These sentences play with the double meaning of a noun:
I used to be a banker, but I lost interest.
Have you heard about the cross-eyed teacher who couldn't control his pupils?
A small boy swallowed some coins and had to go to hospital.When his grandmother phoned to ask how he was, the nurse said: 'No change yet'.
More ambiguity
And these examples play with the different meanings of a verb:
I wondered why the ball was getting bigger.Then it hit me.
No one knew she had a dental implant until it came out in a conversation.
A boiled egg in the morning is hard to beat.
Double trouble
And sometimes a word can be a noun and a verb, but have different meanings.Can you work this one out?
Time flies like an arrow.Fruit flies like a banana.
If you like these homonyms, you will be pleased to know that English has plenty more!
