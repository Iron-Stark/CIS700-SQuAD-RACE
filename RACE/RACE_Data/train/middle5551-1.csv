1,B,"['Because they were not hungry.', 'Because they were sorry for losing the camera.', 'Because they had nothing to eat.', 'Because they had no time to have supper.']",Why didn't they have anything that evening?,"It's Really a Miracle  
Mr. Brown works in New York and he brought his family to China last summer. They visited many places of interest and had a good time here. Before they left for New York, the Browns climbed the Great Wall. It was the greatest project over two thousand years ago. They took a lot of photos there and then they had a picnic under a big tree. Suddenly it began to rain and they hurried to the car. And when they returned to the hotel, they couldn't find the bag in which their expensive camera was. They were all sorry for it. They could buy another camera but had no time to go to the Great Wall again. They could not miss the plane!
That evening they didn't have supper. Mr. Brown hoped to make them happy, so he said, ""Well, let me tell you a story. An old man lived in a sixty-floor building. One day he fell down from it when he was cleaning the window. But he didn't hurt himself.""
""It was a miracle!"" called out his children, ""Why?""
""Because he lived on the first floor!""
They all began to laugh while two policemen with a bag came in. They said a Chinese boy found it under a big tree and he asked them to find out who lost it.
""It's really a miracle!"" the Browns said happily.",middle5551.txt
