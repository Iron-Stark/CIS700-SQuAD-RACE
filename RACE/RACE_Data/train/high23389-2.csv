Last Child in the Woods by Richard Louv

Brief description:
         Camping in the garden, riding bikes through the woods, climbing trees, picking wildflowers, running through piles of autumn leaves... these are the things childhood memories are made of. But for a whole generation of today's children the pleasures of a free-range childhood are missing, and their indoor habits contribute to obesity, attention disorder and childhood depression. This book shows how our children have become increasingly distanced from nature, why this matters and how we can make a difference. Richard Louv is chairman of the Children and Nature Network and co-chair of the National Forum on Children and Nature. He is the author of seven other books and has written for newspapers and magazines including the New York Times and the Washington Post.",high23389.txt
