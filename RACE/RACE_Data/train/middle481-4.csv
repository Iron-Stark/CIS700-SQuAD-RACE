4,C,"['nobody loves us if we give nothing', 'a man who has everything is the happiest', 'losing something may not be a bad thing sometimes', 'we are not whole when we lose something']",The story mainly tells us that  _  .,"Once a circle lost a piece of its own. The circle wanted to be whole, so it went around looking for its missing piece. But because it was incomplete ,it could only roll  very slowly. It enjoyed the flowers and the sunshine along the way. It talked with insects . It found lots of different pieces, but none of them fitted. So it left them all by the side of the road and kept on looking for the missing piece. Then one day the circle found a piece that fitted perfectly, it put the missing piece into itself. It could be whole, with nothing missing. It was so happy and began to roll. Now that it was a perfect circle, it could roll very fast, too fast to see flowers or talk to insects. It realized how different the world was when it rolled so quickly. It felt so sad that it stopped, left the piece it found by the side of the road and rolled away slowly.
Sometimes, we are perfect when we lose something. A man who has everything is a poor man in some ways. He will never have hopes, dreams or something better.
We couldn't be perfect, but we must be brave enough to love, kind enough to share happiness with others and clever enough to know there is enough love around us.",middle481.txt
