In the building, there is the headmaster's room, the teacher's rooms and thirty-four classrooms. We also have two labs  and a library in the building. Our library is on the ground floor. It has books almost  on all subjects. It opens after school from Monday to Friday.
Our school has uniforms . Boys wear white shirts and blue trousers. Girls wear white blouses and blue skirts. We all wear black shoes and white socks.
We study English, Maths, History, Biology, Music and PE at school. My favourite subject is Biology. I think it is fun. Our teachers are nice to us. They check  our homework and help us when we need. I love my school and my teachers.",middle8251.txt
