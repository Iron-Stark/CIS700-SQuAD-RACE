0,B,"['He will pass away.', 'He will leave for a new job.', 'He will get married.', 'He will stay with us forever.']",What will happen to Mark soon?,"Please excuse me if I'm a little sad today because Mark is leaving.You probably don't know Mark,but you might be lucky enough to know someone just like him.He's been the heart and soul of the office for a couple of years combining professional skills with a sweet and gentle nature.He's never been all that interested in getting _ for the terrific work he does.He just wants to do his job,and to do it extremely well.
And now he's moving on to an exciting new professional opportunity.It sounds like it could be the chance of a lifetime,and we're sincerely pleased for him.But that doesn't make it any easier to say goodbye to a dear friend and trusted colleague.
Life has a way of throwing these curve balls at us.Just when we start to get comfortable with a person,a place or a situation,something comes along to change the recipe.A terrific neighbor moves away.Someone in the family graduates.A child finds new love and loyalties through marriage.The family's bread-winner is laid off.Our ability to cope with change and disruption determines our peace,happiness and contentment in life.
But how do we do that? According to the author of Ecclesiaste,comfort can be found in remembering that ""to everything there is a season,and a time to every purpose under heaven.Let today embrace the past with remembrance,and the future with longing.''
""Change,indeed,is painful,yet ever needful,""said philosopher Thomas Carlyle.""And if memory has its force and worth,so also has hope.""
We're going to miss Mark.But rather than lose ourselves in the sadness of our parting,we'll focus on our hopes for a brighter future----for him,and for us.And then we'll go out and do everything we can to make that future happen.Until our plans change----again.",high6014.txt
