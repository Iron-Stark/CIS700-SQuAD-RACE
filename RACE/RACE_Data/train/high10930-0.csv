0,D,"['he is in poor health', 'he cannot move', 'he has a sound sleep', 'he is exhausted']","If someone says he is half dead, he means  _  .","When I first began to work with international students, I asked someone at a lunch, ""What brings you here today?"" Looking at me like I was a bit crazy, he answered, "" The bus."" That was my first realization that no matter how good a speaker is, there are phrases that will always tend to cause confusion to non-native speakers. These idiomatic phrases  add color and interest to any language and are worth learning if you want to talk fluently with native speakers.
""By no stretch""----The speaker is referring to something that's very hard to achieve or realize, even with great effort, as in ""It was not a good meal, by any stretch of the imagination."" Which means that  _ .
""Half dead""----An expression of extreme tiredness, having nothing to do with actual health. Commonly used at the end of a long and tiring day.
""By the book""----This means that an action should follow the rules exactly. It also describes the nature of someone who won't deviate  from a set of rules no matter what the situation is.
""More power to you""----This isn't a wish for you to have better electricity from the power company----it's a statement, usually slightly ironic , that the speaker thinks that you are unlikely to do a task, but you should try if you think you can complete it. It generally means the speaker has no intention of helping you achieve your goal neither will they discourage you from attempting to reach it. For example, ""I don't think you can meet that deadline, but more power to you.""
""As easy as pie""----A reference that something is as simple or easy as eating a delicious dessert, or that it requires little effort to successfully achieve. In chatting, this phrase does not refer to the process of cooking or eating.",high10930.txt
