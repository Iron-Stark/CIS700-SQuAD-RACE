1,C,"['Two.', 'Three.', 'Four.', 'Five.']",How many people are there in Jen's new family?,"""Did you go skating a lot last year?"" I asked. Jen shook her head and looked at me. Finally she said, ""On Thanksgiving, Mom and I always went to visit some friends who lived on a farm. I especially loved seeing their big turkeys.""
Until then, I didn't think about how Jen felt. She had a new stepfather   and stepbrother, and had a new town and home, too. Jen and her mom used to live near a lake where Dad and I went every summer, and she had to move up north with us. She had more changes than me.
Jen seemed sad, so I was busy thinking of some ways to cheer her up on Thanksgiving. I told her my plan and she was excited. First we made a huge snowball, and then a small snowball. Then we built a wall behind the big snowball as a tail. Jen mixed some food coloring with water, saying, ""We can spray   colors on the tail."" Our snow turkey had a red, blue, green, and yellow tail. We were so busy that we didn't notice our parents come outside. Dad found a hat for the snow turkey, and Mom wrapped her scarf around its neck.
"" _ ,"" Mom said. ""You're a good brother, and you always come up with great ideas.'' A happy feeling spread through me. I began to understand how much she cared about everyone in our new family.",middle3746.txt
