3,D,"['Because they wanted to drink more.', 'Because their cows can be happy.', 'Because the milk is more delicious.', 'Because they made by money by selling milk.']",Why did the farms want their cows to increase milk?,"Cows that are named and treated with a ""more personal touch"" can increase milk production by up to 500 pints a year.
The study, by the university's School of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, involved  516 farmers across the UK.
The study found farmers who named their cows got a 54% higher production than those that did not give their cows names. Dairy farmer Dennis Gibb said he believed treating every cow as an individual  was very important.
""They aren't just our means of making money. They're part of the family,"" he said. ""We love our cows here and every one of them has a name. All of us regard them as 'our ladies' but we know every one of them and each one has her own personality.""
Dr Catherine Douglas said, ""What our study shows is what many good, caring farmers have long since believed. Our data suggests that UK dairy farmers regard their cows as intelligent beings . They are able to experience a range of emotions .""
""Placing more importance on knowing the individual animals and calling them by name can, at no extra cost to the farmer, also increase milk production.""
