0,A,"['the girl went to the bathroom by herself', 'the girl pretended to be terrified of nothing', ""the girl's mother was able to blow brave breath"", ""the girl's mother was very proud of herself""]",We learn from the reading that   _  .,"One midnight, a little girl woke up to pass water. She by herself got up and down her bed, walked to the bedroom door and opened it. She looked outside and walked back, for it was so dark in the hall that she feared.
Her mother said, ""Don't be afraid, honey. Take courage!""
""What's courage?"" she asked, running to her mother's bed.
""Courage is the brave breath,"" her mother answered.
""Mum, do you have courage?""
""Certainly.""
The girl held out her little hands, saying, ""Mum, blow some of your breath of courage to me.""
After her mother blew out two mouthfuls of breath into her little cold hands, the little girl clenched her fists  nervously, afraid that the ""breath of courage"" would run away. Then with her fists clenched, she walked out of the bedroom towards the bathroom with nothing to fear.
Her mother said to herself, ""It will be nice if someone can blow some kind of 'breath' to me. Then I can hold it in my hands too when I feel terrified or lost.""
In fact, mostly, what we are terrified of is nothing but the fear in our mind. Who we should defeat  is nobody but ourselves.",middle1219.txt
