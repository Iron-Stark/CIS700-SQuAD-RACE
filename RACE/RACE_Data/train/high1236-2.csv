2,D,"['Hollywood is a film making center making films of violence and disasters.', 'too many Hollywood films showing terrorism and disasters resulted in the Sept. 11 attack.', 'people who were used to the Hollywood films were not shocked at the Sept. 11 attack.', 'in fact, the Sept. 11 attack had nothing to do with Hollywood films.']",From this article we know that   _  .,"As the world watched the twin towers of the World Trade Center come under attack, a common phrase was repeated:"" It looks like a movie.""
But this time there was no superman to save the people or the famous building. The attack destroyed one of the world's highest skyscrapers and left 5,000 people dead or missing.
Movie fans have become used to such events after years of Hollywood films showing disasters, terrorism and danger. The Empire State Building, the White House, New York City and even the American president himself have all been threatened  by terrorist attacks in these exciting films. The film"" True Lies"", released in 1994, is considered to be a good example of this kind of movie. The special effects, including explosions and missiles, make the action look like a real thing.
""Independence Day"" in 1996 took this type of movie one step further by blowing up the White House. This science fiction  movie is about a war between human beings and aliens from another planet. In the movie, the World Trade Center towers are destroyed.
Violence has become a major part of Hollywood movies. And this is what people enjoy. Soon after the attacks, many famous film companies stopped the planned releases of some of their new movies, especially if their films showed terrorist attacks or plane crashes. ""Swordfish"" was top of the American box office in June. But the movie's story was frighteningly similar to the Sept. 11 disaster. The film would have been stopped in American and British cinemas after the attack. But it's unlikely that Hollywood will stay quiet for long. It is already waiting for the feeling in America to calm down.",high1236.txt
