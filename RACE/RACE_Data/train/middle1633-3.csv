Webster has made good, safe, interesting toys for more than 100 years. Now we sell them, and children play with them, in countries from New Zealand to Norway, and from Japan to Brazil. We are looking for someone to sell our toys in the Far East. He will be between thirty and forty. He will already have some years of selling in world markets behind him. He will speak good English, and at least one other language of the Far East.
The person we are looking for will live in Singapore, and work in our office there,  but he will travel for up to six months in any one year. He will know the Far East quite well already. He will know how to sell in old markets and where to find new ones. He will understand money and make more than ever before, for himself, and for Webster Toys.
Webster wants someone who can stand on his own feet. If you think you are the person we are looking for, write to Mr J. Sloman at our head office in London.",middle1633.txt
