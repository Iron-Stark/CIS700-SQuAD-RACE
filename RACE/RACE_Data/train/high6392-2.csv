2,B,"['Vitamin supplements have proved harmful to the health of adults.', 'Vitamin supplements are beneficial in certain conditions.', 'Nowadays taking vitamin supplements is common to most people.', 'Daily multivitamins will make you healthier.']",What can be inferred from the text?,"""Enough"" with the multivitamins already. That's the message from experts behind three new studies that tackled an often debated question: Do daily multivitaminsmake you healthier?
""We believe that the case is closed - supplementing  the diet of well-nourished adults with (most) mineral or vitamin supplements has no clear benefit and might even be harmful,"" concluded the authors of the editorial summarizing the new research papers. They urge consumers to not 'waste' their money on multivitamins. ""The 'stop wasting your money' means that perhaps you're spending money on things that won't protect you long term,"" editorial co-author, Dr. Edgar Miller said, ""What will protect you is if you spend the money on fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, low fat dairy, and things like that. Exercising would probably be a better use of the money.""
The strong message was based on a review of the findings from three studies that tracked multivitamins link to cancer protection, heart health, and brain and cognitive  measures. The first study looked at vitamin supplementation's role in preventing chronic  disease. The next study looked at whether long-term use of multivitamins would have any effect on slowing cognitive decline. The third study looked specifically at multivitamins and minerals role in preventing heart attack. ""The three studies found no difference in rates of chronic disease, heart attack and the need for hospitalization between vitamin-takers and placebo -takers."" Dr. Edgar Miller stated.
One expert agreed some nutrient-deficient people may still benefit from multivitamins. ""There might be an argument to continue taking a multi(vitamin) to replace or supplement your not healthy diet,"" Dr. Edgar Miller added. He also notes that vitamins can benefit people with celiac disease and those who are pregnant.",high6392.txt
