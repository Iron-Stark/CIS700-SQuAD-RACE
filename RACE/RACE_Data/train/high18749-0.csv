0,B,"[""wasn't interested in teaching abroad at all"", ""wasn't sure whether to accept the job to teach in China"", 'knew she would be popular as a teacher in China', 'thought the CanadianChinese woman was joking']",We can infer that at first the writer  _  .,"For me,my great moment came when I actually decided to accept an opportunity to teach English in Shanghai.There were times when I almost gave up because of fear.But in the end I came here.
Last summer,a CanadianChinese woman who teaches in Shanghai just happened to come to the place where I was working in the Seattle area.We talked and I said I had always wanted to teach abroad.She said,""Come to our school.""""Okay.""I replied,but I wasn't sure if I meant it.
We met later for coffee.She answered all of my questions about the school,and gave me the website address and the email address of the person to contact.It took six months for me to finally decide on the job.
First of all,in Shanghai there are many western places to eat western food and lots of interesting things to do.Also,there is a great subway system with directions and stops posted in English.Finding your way around is a challenge in a new place.But that isn't hard here.Taxis are very cheap;you can always jump in one and get home.There are also a lot of westerners in Shanghai,so it is fairly easy to ask for directions.Young Chinese people are much more likely to speak English and they are wonderfully helpful.
I earn almost $1,000 per month and live in a nice rentfree apartment.My biggest expense has been food as I am a vegetarian and also on a diet.I still have not got used to the traditional Chinese food,but if you like it,you'll be in heaven.
Here I have a good place to live in,new friends,a high salary,and a good job.In the US,getting a job at my age has been next to impossible for a woman.",high18749.txt
