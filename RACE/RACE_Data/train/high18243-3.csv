3,B,"['I Can Invent.', 'Imagination Point: Ride Physics', 'Global Games.', 'Saving Sludge City.']",Which feature of the camp can make children learn the basic principles of motion?,"The Camp Invention Program will be held through July at the Hillcrest Intermediate School, North Huntingdon. It exposes children to science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) through hands-on activities.
     The Camp Invention Program, created by Invent Now Kids, was founded in 1990. Now it has grown to include almost l,500 sites across the U. S., with thousands of children attending the program each year.
     ""Our main purpose is to help children develop a greater interest in the fields of STEM,"" said Lori Bryne, the Senior Regional Program Manager. Children in the camp will be given the opportunity to explore the unknown and put ideas into practice.
     The program will challenge children to real world situations that will help them build a team spirit and life skills.
     The program will include five modules this year.
     One module will feature ""Problem Solving on Planet ZAK"". It will challenge children by creating a world of science fiction. Imitating a ""crash"" onto a planet, children will be asked to figure out ways to stay safe, find food and to ""rebuild"" their spacecraft, using a variety of common objects.
     Another module will be ""Saving Sludge City"" which will have children find ways to create a cleaner and eco-friendly city.
    ""Imagination Point: Ride Physics"" asks children to work as interns   in the world's newest and largest theme park called ""Imagination Point"". Children will learn the basic principles of motion through hands-on activities related directly to rides.
     Another feature of the camp will be the ""I Can Invent"" which will focus on the real world of inventions by having children explore the process of invention.
     The final module will be ""Global Games"" which will introduce games ranging from those played in ancient times to the present day to children.
     ""We want to encourage children to go into the fields of STEM,"" Bryne said. ""This program is a fun way to do that.""",high18243.txt
