2,A,"['The meaning of true love.', 'The meaning of giving up necessarily.', 'The meaning of being kind to teachers.', 'The meaning of believing in teachers.']",What did the writer learn from Robby?,"Robby was 11 when his mother dropped him off for his first piano lesson. I prefer students begin at an earlier age. Robby insisted that it had always been his mother's dream to hear him play the piano, so I took him in as a student.
Robby tried and tried while I listened and encouraged him and gave him more instructions  . But he just did not have any inborn ability.
I only saw his mother from a distance. She always waved and smiled but never came in. Then one day Robby stopped coming to our lessons. I thought about calling him but I guessed he had decided to try something else.
 _ . However, several weeks before the recital   of my students, Robby came,telling me that he never stopped practicing and begged me to allow him to take part. I agreed but I made him perform last in the program, so I could always save his poor performance through my ""curtain closer"".
I was surprised when he announced that he had chosen one piece of Mozart's. Never had I heard a piece of Mozart's played so well by someone at his age. When he finished, everyone was cheering.
I ran up and put my arms around Robby in joy. ""I've never heard you play like that, Robby!  How'd you do it?""
""Well, Miss Hondorf. Do you remember I told you my mom was sick? Actually she died this morning. She was born deaf so tonight was the first time she could hear me play. I wanted to make it special. I knew I could.""  That night, Robby was the teacher and I was the student. He taught me so many important things about life.",high3109.txt
