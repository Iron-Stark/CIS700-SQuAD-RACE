1,B,"['He did not like it.', 'He thought it was good', 'He refused to take it.', 'He was unable to follow it.']",What did Tom think of his uncle's advice?,"When Tom finished his studies at the university  , he began to look around for a job. He did not know what he would like to do, but one of his uncles had worked for the government for thirty years, and he advised Tom to try to get a job of the same kind, so he went for an exam one day. He was successful, and his first job was in a large government office in London.
When Tom had been working there for a few weeks, his uncle came to visit the family one Saturday evening. He was pleased that his nephew   had got a job working for the government, and he asked him a lot of questions about it.
One of the questions he asked was, ""How many people work in your department  , Tom?""
The young man thought for a few moments and then answered, ""About half of them, Uncle Jim.""",high11808.txt
