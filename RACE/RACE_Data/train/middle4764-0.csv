0,D,"['write stories', 'sing or dance', 'act in movies', 'B&C']",What can't Xiao Ming do? He can't,"Dear Nancy,
My name is Xiao Ming. I want to be in a club in our school. I'm not famous now. But maybe I can be famous someday! I can't sing or dance or act in movies, but I can do many other things. I can play three instruments: the guitar, the violin and the drums. I think I can be in the music club. Maybe I can be a famous musician. I like to read story books and I can write stories. Maybe I can be a famous writer. I like sports, too, but I don't think I can be a famous and successful sports man. Can I join you?
Love
Xiao Ming",middle4764.txt
