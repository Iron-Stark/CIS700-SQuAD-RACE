Body signals
Pilots from different countries understand body signals if they have the correct training, When you wave your arms up and down in a straight line, it means, ""yes"". When you point downwards and swing your arm from side to side, it means ""no"". If you want the pilot to know that it's safe to land, push your hands out in front of you and bend your knees. If you want to say that it's not safe to land, put your arms in the air and move them to one side.
Smoke signals
The smoke from a fire can be seen from far away, so it's a good way to draw attention. If the weather is dry, it isn't hard to start a fire. Remember, however, that fires can be very dangerous if they get out of control. Never light a tire unless you're sure that it can't spread. If the ground is dark, light smoke can be seen more easily. Green grass and leaves produce light smoke.
Ground-to-air signals
It's a good idea lo build some signals, too. Use large pieces of wood to make the symbols  . If you can't find any wood, use earth. Some useful symbols are:
F ""I need food and water""
II ""I need medicine.""
I ""I am badly hurt.""
X ""I am unable lo move from here.""

However, there is no signal which means ""message not received.",middle5506.txt
