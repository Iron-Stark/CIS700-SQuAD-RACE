Living in a new country gives me many surprises. The first surprise was the way that the US people speak
One day I saw someone was having a public speech in a square. I thought it would be a serious speech. But I soon found it became a kind of entertainment show.
The speaker told the audience to protect the environment with humorous words. Later he said some people's behavior didn't go with their words. He took the example of Taylor Swift's song We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.[
He said that since Swift doesn't want to be with the boy any more, she doesn't need to speak it aloud, she doesn't need to sing unless she still keeps in touch with that guy. It sounds like she is a _ .
Then he sang the song in a funny way. The audience laughed out loudly. I felt a little angry because Swift is my favourite star. I couldn't understand why they laughed at Swift.
As time goes on, I find many US people make fun of others. But they don't mean to hurt them. They do that to show closeness and humour. And people who are laughed at seldom get angry. Now I understand the speaker at the square. Now I've got used to the way the US people speak.
It's easy to find culture shock when you're in a new place. But everyone should learn to understand different cultures and customs.",middle2458.txt
