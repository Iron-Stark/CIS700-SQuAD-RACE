       Whatever you hope to grow, knowing some gardening basics will give you a much better chance of success.
       First you will need to choose a good location for your garden.A sunny location usually works best, since all plants need some sunlight and most plants like lots of it.However, there are some plants that need only indirect sunlight, and these plants will do best in shady spots.
       Check soil too.The best kind of plant soil is called loam  ; it is loose soil that crumbles   easily.Water drains through it well, and it has lots of nutrients to feed your plants.Soil that sticks together might have too much clay in it.Very loose, dry soil might have too much sand.You can improve the soil in your garden by adding organic materials such as compost, or leaves.ks5u

       Fertilizer - If you are planting a big garden, use about 1/2 pounds per 100 square feet.If you are just planting a few plants, get a little container of plant food and follow the directions on the label.Plant fertilizer contains the chemicals that make up a plant's diet.",high21318.txt
