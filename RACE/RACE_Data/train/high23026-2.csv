Personality is the way a person acts, feels and thinks.
Some people are aggressive and always in a hurry. They often become angry when things do not happen the way they planned. They are called ""Type A"" personalities. Studies suggest that these people often get stress-related disorders. The ""Type B"" personality is calmer. These people are able to deal with all kinds of situations more easily. As a result, they are less affected by stress.
Studies have also shown that men and women deal with stress differently. Women seem to be better able to deal with stress than men are. However, experts say women are three times more likely to develop depression in reaction to the stress in their lives. American writer John Gray became famous for his book, ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus."" He notes that men and women have opposite ways of dealing with stress. For a man, the best way is to rest and forget about daily problems. But a woman suffering from stress needs to talk about her problems.
Experts say there are several ways to deal with stress, including deep breathing, exercise, eating healthy foods, getting enough rest and balancing the time spent working and playing. Exercise is one of the most effective stress-reduction measures, as physical changes from exercise make you feel better. In addition, exercise can also improve the body's defense system against disease.
Keeping stress to yourself can make problems worse. Experts say that expressing emotions to friends or family members or writing down your feelings can help reduce stress. And they also suggest that people should attempt to accept or change stressful situations whenever possible.",high23026.txt
