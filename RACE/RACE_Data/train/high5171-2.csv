2,B,"['criticize the traditional way of learning grammar', 'introduce a new way to study English grammar', 'ask students to learn English grammar by listening to stories', 'tell us how the native speakers learn English grammar']",This passage wants to   _  .,"Most students try to learn English grammar using grammar textbooks. They study grammar rules and take grammar tests. They use an analytical  approach, attempting to memorize, and then apply, a great number of rules.
However, research has proved this method inefficient and ineffective. The truth is, the human brain simply cannot consciously remember process and use hundreds of or thousands of grammar rules. Real speech is too fast.
Native speakers do not learn grammar in this way, but rather intuitively   and unconsciously. They learn in a complete way, not by attempting to memorize individual grammar rules. As a result, native speakers use correct grammar fluently and easily.
Fortunately, it is possible for English learners to learn grammar this way. Language teacher Blaine Ray has developed a unique ""intuitive"" approach to teach English grammar. Her system uses ""point of view"" stories to teach the patterns of English grammar, allowing students unconsciously to acquire correct grammar without ever studying grammar rules.
In this system, the teacher first tells a simple story from one point of view. It may be told about the past, then repeated, but beginning with ""since he was a child""; then repeated again, but this time about the future.
Listening to these stories allows students intuitively and effortlessly to learn English grammar and makes them be able to use it correctly when they speak.
Point of View Stories is a creative new way to study English grammar, and offers hope to millions of frustrated English learners.",high5171.txt
