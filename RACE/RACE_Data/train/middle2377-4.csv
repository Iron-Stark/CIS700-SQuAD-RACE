4,A,"['To help the poor man.', 'To make himself well hidden.', 'To sell them at the market the next morning.', 'To buy food and clothes on his way home.']","Why did the old hunter take some animal skins with him when he was waiting for the ""tiger"" ?","Once there lived an old man in a mountain village. He was a famous hunter. He often went hunting alone in the mountains. He was not afraid of any wild animals, not even a tiger.
One night, someone saw a tiger come into the village, and stole two sheep away. The next night the tiger came again. The villagers were frightened. They asked the old hunter to catch it so that they could have a safe life.
When the old man heard about the tiger, he thought hard. He wondered why the tiger came at night twice but only stole the sheep. The next night he walked outside the village. Suddenly he saw the tiger coming. He quickly threw himself on the ground. To his surprise, the tiger did not come at him, but went away. He followed it quietly and found it was running on two of its feet just like a man. Then everything was clear.
On the fourth day, when it got dark, the hunter took some animal skins with him and hid himself behind a big tree near the village. He was waiting for the ""tiger"". As soon as the ""tiger"" came near the tree, the old hunter jumped out, caught the ""tiger"" by the ""leg"" and said, ""Don't be afraid. I do not mean to hurt you. You know who I am, don't you?""
The ""tiger"" said ""Yes"" and took off the tiger's skin.
""You are poor. But you mustn't steal anything from others. Here are some animal skins for you. You may sell them at the market. With the money, you can buy food and clothes for your family. Work harder and try to make a living. "" With tears in his eyes, the poor man thanked the kind-hearted old hunter and walked home.",middle2377.txt
