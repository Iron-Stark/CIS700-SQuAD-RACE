(Wonderful angel who helped me greatly by Kim)
I was so lucky to find Elder Helpers on the web and even luckier that Laura decided to help me get organized. I was hit by a car in January and couldn't do much in my house for several months so things really got _ here. But this Angel of a person came and rescued me. I am so lucky and grateful to have met her and to have received her generous help.
