0,D,"['Drinking tap water is the only choice for people.', 'Glass containers are better than plastic bottles.', 'Plastic bottles are harmful to the environment.', 'Bottled water may not be as good as we think.']",What is the main idea of the article?,"Bottled water has become the choice for people who are healthy and thirsty. Bottled water is all over the world. But some say the planet's health, and people's health may be suffering from it.
The idea that bottled water is safer for humans may not be true. The Natural Resources Defense Council of America said, ""There is no promise that because water comes out of a bottle, it is cleaner or safer than water from the tap."" Another New York City-based action group added that some bottled water is ""really just tap water in a bottle--sometimes more clean, sometimes not.""
It is not proven that bottled water is better than tap water. Nick Reeves from the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management said, ""The high mineral content  of some bottled water makes them not good for feeding babies and young children."" Also, most bottled water doesn't have fluoride , which can make teeth stronger. Kids are drinking more bottled water and less fluoridated tap water, and some say that's behind the recent rise in bad teeth.
Storing is another problem. Placed near heat, the plastic bottles can produce bad chemicals  into the water.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, some 2.7 million tons of plastic are used worldwide to bottle water each year. The plastic can take between 400 and 1,000 years to break down.
In terms of energy use, plastic bottles are also not cheap. One report said that if water and soft drink bottlers had used 10 percent recycled materials in their plastic bottles, they would have saved about 72 million gallons of gas.
So, if you are worried about the effect of bottled water on the Earth, you can take the following steps.
*Drink from your tap. Unless your government warns against this, it should be fine.
*Get a container . Carry your tap water in a steel or a lined drinking container, and clean it between uses.
*Keep it cool. Don't drink from a bottle that has been sitting in the sun, don't store it near chemicals, and don't reuse plastic bottles.
*Choose glass containers over plastic if possible. When finished, recycle!",high12821.txt
