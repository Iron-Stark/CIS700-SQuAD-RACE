0,D,"['$28.', '$5.', '$43.', '$10.']",How much did the couple spend at the fair?,"Matt and his wife lived in the country. Matt was very mean and hated spending money. One day a fair came to the nearby town.
They went to the fair and looked at all the things to buy. Matt's wife wanted to buy a hat only costing $28, but was refused. Later on, a comb of $5 attracted her attention, but he would not let her spend any money.
Then, in a nearby field, they saw a small airplane. ""Fun flight!"" the notice said, ""$10 for 10 minutes.""
Matt had never been in an airplane and he wanted to go on a fun flight. However, he didn't want to pay for his wife either. ""I've only got $10,"" he told the pilot. ""Can my wife come with me for free?"" The pilot wasn't selling many tickets, so he said, ""I'll make a bargain with you. If your wife doesn't scream, she can have a free flight.""
Matt agreed, and got into the small airplane with his wife. The pilot took off and made his airplane do all kinds of things. At one moment it was flying upside down.
When the plane landed, the pilot said, ""OK, your wife didn't make a sound. She can have her ride free.""
""Thank you,"" Matt said, ""it wasn't easy for her, you know, especially when she fell out.""",high2924.txt
