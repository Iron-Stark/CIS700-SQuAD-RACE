But how can I get up to the top of the house?"" he said to himself.
He looked around and found a ladder  against a tree nearby. He was very glad. But as he reached the top he heard someone shouting at him. "" Hey, what are you doing up there?"" Mr Smith was looking at him angrily and beside him was a policeman.
