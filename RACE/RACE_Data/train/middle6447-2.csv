Thirty years ago, I walked into your bakery  and asked for some loaves of bread to sell. At that time I was twelve years old. A young lady was working that day. She gave me five loaves and wished me good luck.
I took the loaves and went out to sell them. It took me all day, but I sold them all. At the end of the day, I had some money. I was the happiest boy in the world as I walked home that evening.
The next day, I went to a bicycle shop. I paid a deposit on a new bicycle. And then I started my next job--as a newspaper deliver boy. Soon I could pay the rest of the money for the bicycle and the bike was mine. I was so proud!
Today, I still work in the delivery business. I have a lot of trucks to send goods all over the country. I live in a beautiful house, but I don't ride a bicycle these days. I drive a large and nice car.
I do not know who that young lady was. But because she gave me the start, I have become a successful man. I'd like to show my thanks to her.
Yours,
George Jenkins",middle6447.txt
