Now they are eight years old. Helen's mother has a new baby. Helen is very happy to have a little sister, so she always talks about her to Betty.
At first Betty is very interested in the new baby. But after some time she begins to get unhappy because Helen doesn't stop talking about it.

""That is not much,"" says Betty. ""I know a baby that puts on ten pounds a day.""
