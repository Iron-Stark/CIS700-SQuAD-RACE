2,D,"[""A lot of food that looks good isn't good."", ""Organic food doesn't pollute the environment."", ""Some ingredients in drinks may be bad for people's health."", 'All the food has pollution.']",Which of the following is NOT true?,"""You are what you eat,"" says the old saying. So how can we know what food is healthy? Unluckily, a lot of food that looks good may have pollution. Where is the pollution from? It has something to do with how people produce food: growing it on the farm, processing  it in factories, and making it ready for you to eat.
Here's what happens:
Most farmers use chemicals  to stop their crops from getting sick. Many of these chemicals remain in the food that you eat. Some people believe this may cause cancer. These chemicals may also pollute water and air, and kill animals and even people by accident.
Most drinks are just flavored water  . Every drink coming in plastic bottles which you then throw away means a waste. Sugary drinks make you fat.
In the factories, much of what you eat and drink gets messed. Often things are put into food to make it delicious and look good but they might be harmful to people. And some food like meat often gets polluted by bacteria. What you can do:
Try to get organic  food. Organic food doesn't have any ingredients  that are bad for the land, air or water. Don't eat processed food or drinks. Eat fresh food whenever you can and cook at home.",middle6714.txt
