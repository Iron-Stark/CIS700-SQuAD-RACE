All the students had to take part in a talk on road safety which was given by a police officer. The following is what the police officer said. ""
""Most traffic accidents shouldn't happen. They happen because people are careless. A frequent cause of traffic accidents is speed. Some people drive too quickly. This means that if they have to stop suddenly, they cannot stop quickly enough to avoid  hitting other vehicles  or people. You need to remember this when you are crossing the street or walking along the sidewalk. ""
""It's not only drivers who cause accidents, however. People on foot-pedestrians, and bicycle riders often cause accidents, too. Pedestrians sometimes walk out into the street without looking. You should always look on both sides before stepping into the street. ""
""Do any of you ride a bike? Bicycle riders can cause accidents by changing directions suddenly or without warning other road users. Before you turn left, for example, you should check behind you to make sure there aren't any cars, trucks or buses coming. You should show with your left hand to tell that you want to turn left. You should not turn until the street is clear. ""
""The rules of the road are very simple. If we learn them and obey  them, we should not have accidents any more. """,middle834.txt
