3,C,"['In order to let Farmer Joe keep silent about the accident', ""As the mule's groan was too loud"", 'Thinking it was the best way to stop the mule from suffering', 'To make Farmer Joe feel better']","_  , the patrolman shot the mule.","One day, my friend Jimmy told me a story. Farmer Joe was in his cart when he was hit by a truck. He decided his injuries from the accident were serious enough to take the trucking company (which caused the accident)to court. In court the trucking company's lawyer was questioning Farmer Joe. ""Didn't you say, at the same scene of the accident, 'I'm fine'?"" said the lawyer.
Farmer Joe responded, ""Well, I will tell you what happened. I had just loaded my favorite mule Bessie into the..."" ""I didn't ask for any details,"" the lawyer interrupted, ""Just answer the question.Did you not say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine? ' ""
Farmer Joe said, ""Well, I had just got Bessie into the cart and I was driving down the road...""
The lawyer interrupted again and said, ""Judge, I am trying to make clear the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the police on the scene that he was just fine. Now several weeks after the accident he is trying to cover the fact. I believe he is telling lies. Please tell him to simply answer the question.""
By this time the Judge was fairly interested in Farmer Joe's answer and said to the lawyer, ""I'd like to hear what he has to say about his favorite mule Bessie.""
Joe thanked the Judge and went on, ""Well, as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my favorite mule, into the cart and was driving her down the road when this huge truck ran into the stop sign and pushed my cart right in the side. I was thrown into one side and Bessie was thrown into the other.""
""I was hurt so badly that I didn't want to move. However, I could hear old Bessie breathing loudly and groaning  . I knew she was in great pain. Shortly after the accident a traffic policeman came to the scene. He could hear Bessie groaning so he went over to her. After he looked at her, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes. Then the patrolman came across the road with his gun and looked at me. He said, ""Your mule was in such pain that I had to shoot her. How are you feeling?""",high20667.txt
