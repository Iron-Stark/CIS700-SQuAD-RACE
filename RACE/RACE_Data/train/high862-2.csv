2,B,"['Colors and Shapes', 'Packaging Can Talk', 'The response to the packages', 'What is packing?']",What's the best title of the passage?,"There are thousands of things to be sold that are of all colors and shapes in a supermarket, making you believe that they are good enough for you to have a try. How packaging is the quiet but persuading salesman?
There on the shelves,each bottle, can and box has been carefully designed to speak to the inner self of the consumer , so that he is buying not only a product but also his belief in life. Scientists have studied on this and found that the look of the package has a great influence on the ""quality"" of the product and on how well it sells, because ""Consumers generally cannot tell between a product and its package. Many products are packages and many packages are products,"" as Louis Cheskin, the first social scientist studying consumers' feeling for packaging, noticed.
Colors are one of the best tools in packaging. Studies of eye movement have shown that colors draw human attention quickly. Take V8 for example. For many years,the bright red color of tomatoes and carrots on the thin bottle makes you feel that it's very good for your body. _ 
Shapes are another attraction.Circles often mean happiness, because they are pleasing to both the eye and the heart. That's why the round yellow M sings of McDonald's are inviting to both young and old.
This new consumer response to the colors and shapes of packages reminds producers and sellers that people buy to meet the needs of both body and heart.",high862.txt
