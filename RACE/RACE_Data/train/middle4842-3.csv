3,C,"['Find out how many points we need or how much each question is worth.', 'Try not to leave questions unanswered when we finish the test.', ""If it asks to give one answer, we'd better write more."", 'Sometimes we should guess the answers to get points.']",Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?,"Do you want to do well in exams? Sometimes your knowledge is not enough, you also need good strategies. Here are some for you:
Before you answer the questions, if you feel a little nervous, take a few deep breaths to help you relax.  Always read the question carefully and make sure that you understand it. Read it a few times if possible.  Find out how much each question is worth or how many points you need.  If it asks to give one answer, only write one.
If there is a difficult question, don't worry. Go on to the next question and come back to it if you have time later.  Try not to leave questions unanswered when you finish the test. Sometimes a guess may get your points.
When you finish, go back and check your answers. You will need to check your writing or spelling mistakes.",middle4842.txt
