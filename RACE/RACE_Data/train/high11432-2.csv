2,C,"['the man had his eyes blinded in a fight', 'the man must be a painter before', 'the woman was very devoted to his husband', 'the man often killed time by visiting exhibitions']",What can be inferred from the passage is   _  .,"One afternoon I toured an art museum while waiting for my husband to finish a business meeting. I was looking forward to a quiet view of the wonderful works..
A young couple viewing the paintings ahead of me chatted nonstop between themselves. I watched them a moment and decided she was doing all the talking. I admired his patience for tolerating her constant words. Disturbed by their noise, I moved on.
I _ them several times as I moved through the various rooms of art. Each time I heard her constant talking, I moved away quickly.
I was standing at the counter of the museum gift store doing some shopping when the couple approached the exit. Before they left, the man reached into his pocket and pulled out a white object. He turned it into a long cane   and then tapped his way into the coatroom to get his wife's jacket.
""He's a brave man,"" the clerk at the counter said, ""Most of us would give up if we were blinded at such a young age. During his recovery, he made a promise his life wouldn't change. So, as before, he and his wife come in whenever there's a new art show.""
""But what does he get out of the art?"" I asked, ""He can't see.""
""Can't see! You're wrong. He sees a lot. More than you or I do,"" the clerk said, ""His wife describes each painting so he can see it in his head.""
I learned something about patience, courage and love that day. I saw the patience of a young wife describing paintings to a person without sight and the courage of a husband who would not allow blindness to change his life.
And I saw the love shared by two people as I watched this couple walk away arm in arm.",high11432.txt
