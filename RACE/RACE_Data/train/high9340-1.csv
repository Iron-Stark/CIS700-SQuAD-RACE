This matters not only for individual pupils but also for the well-being of countries, he says, because improving educational performance has a direct impact on improving economic performance.
China's education performance-- at least in cities such as Shanghai and Hong Kong-- seems to be as spectacular as the country's fast growing economy.

""Shanghai and Hong Kong are small education systems, with a concentration of ideas, manpower and resources for education,"" says Prof Cheng.
