But most are too weak to feel and big earthquakes are less common. Here are some things to do to prepare for an earthquake and what to do once the ground starts shaking.
Preparation Tips
* Have a plan for an earthquake.
*Consult  a professional to learn how to make your home sturdier, such as fixing bookcases to the wall, using strong locks on cupboards , and fixing the water heater to the war firmly.
*Locate a place in each room of the house that you can go to if an earthquake happens. It should be a place where nothing is likely  to fall on you.
*Keep some canned food, an up-to-date first aid box, 3 gallons(11.4 liters) of water per person.
* Know how to turn off your gas and water mains.
If Shaking Begins
*Drop down; take cover under a desk or table and hold on.
*Stay indoors until the shaking stops and you are sure it's safe to leave.
*Stay away from bookcases or furniture that can fall on you.
*Stay away from windows.
*If you are in bed, hold on and stay there, protecting your head with a pillow.
* If you are outdoors, find a clear place away from buildings, trees, and power lines. Drop to the ground.
* If you are in a car, slow down and drive to a clear place. Stay in the car until the shaking stops.",high19164.txt
