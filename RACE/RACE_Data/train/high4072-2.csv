2,D,"['Women with brains can also be as successful as men.', 'Women have to pay a high price for success.', 'A judgment must be made free from prejudice.', 'Sex discrimination still exists nowadays.']",What does the writer intend to tell us?,"Pride and Prejudice for the Modern Woman
Let us imagine how Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen's most famous work, might be updated, 200 years on.
Austen's popularity is rooted in her intelligence. But today she would certainly have had a very different life, as would her characters. Here's my own suggestion. . .
It is a truth finally and universally acknowledged that a single woman with brains deserves to have equal opportunities to men, however disadvantaged she may feel by sexism.
"" My dear husband,"" said his hopeful wife one day, "" have you heard that the local store, standing empty for so long, is taken over by a bright young businesswoman?""
Her dull and indifferent   husband replied that he had not. ""But it is, it is,"" she replied excitedly. Mr Dull-Husband made no reply.
""Don't you want to know her plans?"" she cried with some impatience.
""Well, clearly you think it matters to your silly little head. .. so I'd better listen. ""
""Well, my dear, the rumour   is that she has already set up a string of successful businesses in northern England, though _ She will move in herself next month. "" ""What is her name?"" ""Bingley. ""
""Is she married or single?""
""What a question! And none of your business. But her coming will be a fine thing for our five boys. "" ""How so? How can it possibly affect them? ""
""My dear love; those lazy boys need something to wake them up. There are bound to be jobs going. ""
"" Is that her point in settling here? Surely as a woman she has simply taken a fancy to the place. ""
"" Nonsense, my love, how little you've noticed the world has changed. She's got a first-rate degree and some sort of business qualification, I'm told. She surely needs one of our boys! Perhaps you might give her a call. ""
"" Me? No. Perhaps you can take an interest. You still have your looks, after all. She may even offer you a job. "" ""Oh, that's not likely. These new chances belong to the younger generation. But now you mention it, I think I'll go along all the same. ""
And Mrs Bennet went along. That was 10 years ago. She is now managing director of a FTSE-listed company.
... It would remain the case, of course, that Mrs Bennet would be one of very few women on the company board, that her salary would be lower than her male colleagues, her bonus of a more ""female"" dimension and her lifespan   among the city's business leaders shorter than theirs. Still, she'd no doubt have enjoyed Davos--and might even have hobnobbed   with influential figures.",high4072.txt
