0,B,"['the meaning of a Latin word', 'a different meaning', 'the meaning of ""in"" or ""out of""', 'a lot of meanings']","By adding a prefix or a suffix to a root, we can get a word which has   _  .","Some English words are made up of the same part and have different beginnings and different endings, such as import, export, report and transport. All these words, you can see, have the same ""port"", which comes from the Latin word, meaning ""to carry"" or ""to move"" from one place to another. And according to the bit at the beginning, which we call the prefix, the meaning changes. ""Import"" means ""to carry in"" or ""to bring into a country""; ""export"", ""ex"" means ""out of"", so this word means ""to carry out of the country""; ""re"" means ""back"", so the ""report"" means ""to tell somebody, to bring back information to somebody""; ""transport"", ""trans"" means ""across"" and it means ""to carry across one place to another"". 
Let's look at the following words: supporter, reporter, importer and exporter. You can see that in this case these words are nouns which are made up of the verbs plus a suffix, thus meaning a person who does this thing. So ""supporter"" means somebody who supports. A ""reporter"" is somebody who reports. ""Importer"" is somebody who imports and ""exporter"" is somebody who exports, and so on.",high17350.txt
