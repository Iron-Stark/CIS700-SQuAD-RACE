He made it just the right size to fill the space between the two windows. When I got home that evening, John was drinking a cup of tea and writing out his bill for his job. My wife said to me quietly, ""That's his ninth cup of tea today."" But she said in a loud voice, ""It's a beautiful table, dear, isn't it?"" ""I'll decide about that when I see the bill."" I said. John laughed and gave me his bill.
It said:
One dining table                                   10thNovember,2014
Cost of wood                    $17.00
Paint                                            $1.50
Work,8 hour( $1.00 an hour)            $ 8.00
Total                                            $ 36.50
When I was looking at the bill,John said,""It's been a fine day,hasn't it? Quite sunny.""
""Yes,"" I said.""I'm glad it's only the 10thof November.""
""Me too."" said John, ""You wait--it'll be a lot colder by the end of the month.""
""Yes, colder--and more expensive! Dining tables will be $20 more expensive on November 30th, won't they, John?""
John looked hard at me for half a minute. I gave his bill back to him.
""If it isn't too much trouble, John,"" I said,""please add it up again. You can forget the date...""
I paid him $26.50 and he was happy to get it.",middle4867.txt
