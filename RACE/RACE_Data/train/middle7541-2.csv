2,C,"['Unforgettable rainy days', 'An unknown man', 'Good turns worth another', 'A beautiful umbrella']",What's the best title for the passage?,"My friends and I had just finished lunch at a hotel when it started to rain heavily. When it became lighter, I decided to get my car which was parked at my office three streets away.
My friends argued that I shouldn't go, mainly because I was seven months pregnant   then. I promised that I'd be very careful. One of them wanted to come with me but I asked her to stay with another friend who needed help with her baby.
I walked out of the hotel and started making my way to the car. At the crossing, a black car stopped and a man came out with an umbrella. Before I knew what was happening, he walked right through me and told me he'd escort   me. Although I refused, he insisted   that he would.
During our walk, he kept telling me to walk slower, as the ground was wet. When we got to the car-park, I thanked him and he went away. I did not get his name and can hardly recognize   him now. Did he stop for me? I'll never know.
So how did I pay it forward? I was at home when I noticed two Indian workers walking in the heavy rain. They were probably on their way to the working place near my home. _ 
They were surprised by my action. They were very grateful to me, probably wondered why a stranger was offering such kindness. I was so relaxed and happy that day.",middle7541.txt
