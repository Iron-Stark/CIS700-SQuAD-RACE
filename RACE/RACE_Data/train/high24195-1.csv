The radio has more than just music. Check the local news station for the latest traffic report. Or go online and check traffic cameras before you set out. If there is a jam, you'll be prepared and can try another route.
Take the road less traveled. Although highways may be the most direct route, back roads can be much less crowded, which can save you from the frustration of the stop-and-go traffic.
Rush hour isn't just a lovely nickname. It means the morning and afternoon traffic lasts for several hours, but they are still called ""rush hour"" for a reason--everyone's on the road and in a hurry to get somewhere. Treat rush hour like bad weather--if you don't have to go anywhere, stay off the roads.
Tips for those unavoidable traffic jams
Don't break the law. You've gone 30 feet in 30 minutes and all of a sudden you see people using the shoulders . Don't behave like them. Not only is this illegal, but also there's a good chance they'll get caught or cause even more problems.
Pay extra attention to zig-zaggers when some people are anxious, they may start changing lanes every 5 seconds or cut you off. Keep checking your windows and mirrors for these lane changers.
Look for an escape. If it is possible to exit the road safely, do it. Use a GPS unit, and you can change your route mid-trip if needed.
Be courteous. Good manners could help you avoid a possible accident. Allow people in from a lane that is ending. Speeding up to keep them out increases your chances of an accident.",high24195.txt
