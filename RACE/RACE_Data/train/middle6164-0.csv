Thanks for your family photo. This is a photo of my family. I have a happy family. There are five people  in my family. They are my grandmother, my parents, my sister and I. The old  woman  is my grandmother. The man  is my father. His name is David. He is a teacher. And what about the woman? She is my mother. Her name is Linda. She is very nice. Look at the girl.
