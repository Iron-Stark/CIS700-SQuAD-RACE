3,C,"['held her own breath', 'talked to her mother', 'held her little hands', 'ran to her bedroom quickly']","To keep ""mother's breath"" from running away, the girl   _  .","One midnight, a little girl woke up to go to the bathroom. She got up and down her bed, walked to the bedroom door and opened it. She looked outside and walked back, because it was so dark that she was scared.
Her mother said, ""Don't be afraid, honey. Take courage!""
""What's courage?"" she asked, running to her mother's bed.
""Courage is the brave breath,"" her mother answered.
""Mum, do you have courage?""
""Certainly!""
The girl held out her hands, saying, ""Mum, please blow some of your courage breath to me.""
After her mother blew out two mouthfuls of breath into her little cold hands, the little girl held her hands nervously , afraid that the ""breath of courage"" would run away. Then, she walked out of her bedroom towards the bathroom with nothing to fear.
Her mother said to herself, "" It will be nice if someone can blow some kind of ""breath"" to me. Then I can hold it in my hands too when I feel afraid or lost.""
In fact, mostly, what we are afraid of is nothing but the fear in our mind. Who we should beat against is nobody but ourselves.",middle7013.txt
