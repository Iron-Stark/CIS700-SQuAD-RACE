0,A,"['to have dinner', 'to meet the film-makers', ""to celebrate April Fool's Day"", 'to play a magician']",James came to the restaurant   _  .,"James and his wife went to Beijing Restaurant for dinner at 7:00 pm. On April 1st, 2005, while they were eating, a waitress came to tell them that the two men at the next table were film-makers and that they would like to have a talk with James.
James agreed. One man came to sit down next to him and said that they were making a film named ""The Magic Gloves."" The story was like ""Harry Potter"" and they were looking for an actor to play a magician. They would like to invite James to have a try.
James was excited, ""Many people think I look like Patrick Steward."" However, as he was going to leave China in 3 days, he wanted to try out after dinner. The man agreed.
At 9:00 pm, when James asked for the bill so that he could go with the film-makers, the manager of Beijing Restaurant said sorry to him with a smile, ""It's April Fool's Day joke! Your meal is free. Thank you.""
James completely forgot about it but when he found that he was fooled, he didn't leave at once. The waitress asked him if he needed some help. James said, ""I was fooled once. I'm afraid the meal is not free. I am waiting for the bill to see if it is another joke.""",middle7684.txt
