0,C,"['can do work as accurately as workers', 'never break down', 'can do exactly the same thing repeatedly', 'ask for less money from companies']",According to the text robots   _  .,"I visited the nearby car factory today with my uncle, who works there. One thing I noticed was that most of the work is now done by robots. Welding  , painting, testing, and many other jobs are performed by robots now. 
The whole dashboard   of the car is now put into the car from above, through the windshield, by a robot. It would have taken two men to do this in the past, and it would have hurt their backs quite a bit. It got me thinking: is it a good thing that robots are replacing factory workers? On one hand, robots generally do a more accurate job than people. They aren't likely to make many mistakes, and if something goes wrong with one car, an alarm goes off. They do exactly the same thing, every time, without fail. A human worker is never able to do exactly the same thing every time. On the other hand, robots also reduce costs for companies. Companies don't have to pay robots wages or injury compensation   if they're broken. If something in a robot does go wrong, it won't have to take time off work for a year, or even forever, as could happen to a real person if he breaks his back or burn himself while welding.
The obvious  _ to all of this is that it increases the unemployment rate.The company will have to bring in some very talented individuals who know how to operate the robots. Unlike regular factory workers, these intelligence workers usually demand a higher pay.",high3489.txt
