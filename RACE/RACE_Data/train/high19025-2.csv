Yeager's greatest achievement is her cultural impact on making bikinis popular. ""Anyone in Miami in the 1950s who wanted a bikini would come to her, and she'd make one,"" he said.

She began taking photos of Page in 1954 as she began her job behind the camera.
She published about a dozen books. And her works have been displayed in art galleries across the world.
Yeager said she had a few requests when several magazines began to struggle or went out of business over the last decade, but her career returned to the public in 2010 when the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh held an exhibition of her works, followed by another exhibition in Miami in 2013.
