4,B,"['Friendly.', 'Shy.', 'Nice.', 'Kind.']",Which of the following words can't describe  the Greek shopkeeper?,"It was the Greek shopkeeper who taught me about the power of being kind.
In 2008, I left Spain to study alone in London. My parents had to bring up  my three younger sisters and two younger brothers, so I found three part-time jobs to pay for my studies. I worked early mornings and late nights, so I was tired, really tired, all the time.
Unluckily, I got a cold and had a very high fever. Because I was new in London, I had no friends. Besides, I was too shy to talk with others and ask others for help. After sleeping on the bed for two days, I went out to get some food. Usually, I went to the supermarket, but this time I went into the Greek shop, a small corner shop, because it was closer.
I picked up some food and gave it to the shopkeeper, who asked me, 'You look terrible, my boy! You are not feeling well, right?'
I said YES in a low voice.
She pointed at the salami   and bread I was buying and offered, 'I can make you a sandwich, so you don't have to do it yourself.'
I nodded without saying a word.
So, she made the sandwich and asked me to wait a moment. She went into the back room and came again with a bowl of hot soup.
'It will warm you up,' she said with a friendly smile.
What really warmed me up was not the soup. It was her smile that told me she cared me. Her kindness  made me think of my mother.
I was quite shy, but from that day on, I did not let shyness stop me from talking with and being kind to others. Now I work in a children's hospital in Africa. I love my work and people around me. I always bring my smile and kindness to them.",middle5400.txt
