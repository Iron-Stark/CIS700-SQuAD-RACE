4,B,"['the author is worried about his patient when he is driving through the foggy streets of East London', 'the author is annoyed to be called out at such an horrible morning hour for an ear - ache patient', 'the author is now heading for the beach in Southern France for his holidays', 'as the author speeds down Lea Bridge in the dark on a December morning, his Mini breaks down half way']",We can conclude that  _  .,"""How lucky you are to be a doctor...""

As I speed down Lea Bridge in the dark at this horrible morning hour, the heater first blowing hot then cold, my back aching from the car-seat, I do not feel like a ministering angel. I wish I were on the beach in southern France. Call me a bad doctor if you like. Call me what you will. But don't call me at half past three on a December morning for an ear-ache that you have had for two weeks.

But all too often 'everything' is a repetitious rule: look, listen, feel, tap, pills, injection, phone, ambulance, away to the next.
And then there is always the cool, warm voice of the girl on the switchboard of the emergency bed service who will get your patient into hospital for you-the pleasant voice that comes to you as you stand in the cold, dark, smelly, dirty telephone box somewhere in a dangerous section of town.
