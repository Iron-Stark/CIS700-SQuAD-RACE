0,D,"['she watched the scene with her daughter', 'the scene was very exciting and interesting', 'the scene taught her and her daughter a good lesson', ""the scene showed a mother's deep love for her children""]",The writer was deeply impressed by the scene inPeter Pan because   _  .,"My 17-year-old daughter went off to college and having her away from home brought back memories of watchingPeter Pan when she was little. In the classic TV production, one scene in particular impressed me: when Mrs Darling puts her children into bed.

""You feel like something has been taken away from inside you,"" said one of them.

Meanwhile, as I keep my cellphone close to me in bed and text my daughter goodnight and sweet dreams every night, I like to think that messages serve as a night light that keeps her safe.",high344.txt
