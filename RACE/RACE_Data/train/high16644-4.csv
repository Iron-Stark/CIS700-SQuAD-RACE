4,B,"['Reporter are always friendly and helpful.', 'The power   of language is great.', 'The blind man is very stupid, so he has little money.', 'We can get more money by changing a sign.']",What can we learn from the passage?,"One day, there was a blind man called John sitting on a bench with a hat by his feet and a sign that read, ""I am blind. Please help me.""
A reporter named Tom was walking by the blind man and stopped to see that the man only had a few coins in his hat. He put a few of his own coins in the hat. Without asking for permission, took the sign, turned it around and wrote a new message. Then he put the sign by the feet of the blind man, and left. 
Later that afternoon the reporter returned to the blind man and noticed that his hat was almost full of bills and coins. The blind man recognized his footsteps and asked if it was he who had changed his sign. He also wanted to know what the man wrote on it.
The reporter said, ""I just wrote the message a little differently."" He smiled and went on his way.
The new sign read, ""Spring has come, but I can't see anything.""",high16644.txt
