You are not alone. Holidays are happy days with pleasure and delicious foods. Many people, however, are worried about the weight that comes along with these delicious foods.
With proper planning, though, it is possible to control your weight. The idea is to enjoy the holidays but not to eat too much. You don't have to turn away from the foods that you enjoy. The following suggestions may be of some help to you.
* Do not miss meals. Before you leave home for a big dinner, have small, low fat foods. This may help to keep you from getting too excited before delicious foods.
* Begin with clear soup and fruit or vegetables. A large glass of water before you eat may help you feel full. Use a small plate ; a large plate will encourage you to have more than enough.
* Better not have high fat foods. Dishes that look oily have much fat in them.
* Fill your plate with salad and green vegetables.
* If you have a sweet tooth, try some fruits. They don't have as much fat as cream and chocolate.
* Don't let exercise take a break during the holidays. A 20 minutes' walk after a meal can help burn off calories  .",middle5000.txt
