0,B,"['skip math classes for no reason', 'are receiving no formal education', 'are busy supporting their families', 'make full contributions to their countries']","According to the passage, millions of girls   _  .","Right now, 62 million girls worldwide are not in school. They're receiving no reading, no writing, no math--none of the basic skills they need to provide for themselves and their families, and contribute fully to their countries.
Often, understandably, this issue is considered as a matter of result of a failure to invest enough money in educating girls. We can solve this problem, the argument goes, if we provide more scholarships and safe transportation and build more school bathrooms for girls. And it's true that investments like these are important for addressing our global girls' education crisis. But we cannot solve our girls' education problem until we deal with the broader cultural beliefs and practices that can help cause this crisis and make it continue.
We know that legal and cultural change is possible because we've seen it countries around the world, including our own. A century ago, women in American couldn't even vote. Decades ago, it was perfectly legal for employers to refuse to hire women. But in each generation, brave people -both men and women--stood up to change these practices. They did it through individual acts like taking their bosses to court and even through national movements that brought changes.
Cultural changes like these can encourage countries to make greater investments in girls' education. And when they do, that can cause a powerful effect that can cause even greater cultural and political progress for women. Girls who are educated marry later. Educated girls also can earn higher salaries. And when educated girls became healthy, financially secure, empowered women, they're far better equipped to achieve their needs and wishes, and challenge unjust laws and harmful practices and beliefs.
But for me, this issue isn't just about politics or economics --- for me, this is a moral issue. As I've traveled the world, I've met so many of these girls. They're so hungry to realize their promise. They walk for hours each day to school, learning at rickety desks in bare concrete classrooms. These girls aren't different from my daughters or any of our daughters. None of us here in the USA would accept this for our own daughters and granddaughters, so why would we accept it for any girl on our planet?
As a first lady, a mother, and a human being, I cannot walk away from these girls, and I plan to keep raising my voice on their behalf for the rest of my life. I plan to keep talking about this issue here at home, because I believe that all of us--men and women, in every country on this planet--have a moral obligation to give all of these girls a future worthy of their promise and their dreams.",high13810.txt
