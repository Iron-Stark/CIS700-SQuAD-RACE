2,B,"['Susie felt deeply sorry for her foolish mistake', 'Susie used to be in the same trouble as the boy', ""the boy doesn't get along well with his classmats"", 'nobody but the teacher helps the boy in the accident']",We can learn from the passage that   _  .,"There is a nine-year-old kid sitting at his desk and all of a sudden, there is water between his feet and his pants are wet. He thinks his heart is going to stop. It's never happened before, and he knows that when the boys find out he will never hear the end of it. When the girls find out, they'll never speak to him again .
The boy puts his head down and prays, ""Dear God, this is an emergency! I need help now! I'm dead meat .""He looks up from his prayer and here comes the teacher with a look in her eyes that says he has been discovered.
As the teacher is walking toward him, a classmate named Susie is carrying a goldfish bowl that is filled with water. Susie trips  in front of the teacher and throws the bowl of water on the boy's legs.
The boy pretends to be angry, but all the while is saying to himself, ""Thank you, Lord! Thank you, Lord!""
Now all of a sudden, instead of being the object of  _ , the boy is the object of sympathy. The teacher gives him gym shorts to put on while his pants are dried out. All the other children are on their hands and knees cleaning up around his desk. The sympathy is wonderful. But as life would have it, the ridicule that should have been his goes to someone else - Susie. She tries to help, but they tell her to get out. You've done enough, you klutz!'
Finally, at the end of the day, as they are waiting for the bus, the boy walks over to Susie and whispers, 'You did that on purpose, didn't you?'  Susie whispers back, 'I wet my pants once too.'",high22015.txt
