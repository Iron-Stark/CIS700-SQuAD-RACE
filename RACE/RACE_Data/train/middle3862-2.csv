2,D,"['The pink one.', 'The blue one.', 'The yellow one.', 'The yellow and blue one.']",Which dress did the writer give her friend finally?,"One day, my mother said, ""Let's buy you some new clothes."" I was very happy and surprised because my family didn't have much money at that time. I bought three dresses, a pink one, a blue one and, best of all, a yellow and blue one. I loved that yellow and blue dress.
I showed my three new beautiful dresses to my best friend Emily. She loved them all and was happy for me. But she also felt sad and said her father could only buy her new clothes for her birthday. So I asked her to pick one. Then she picked the best one--the yellow and blue dress! You should know that I was only 7 years old and it was my turn to feel sad. She wore it and I saw her smiling, so happy and beautiful. I could feel her joy! So, I told her it looked great on her. That day, I did my best to explain this to my mother. She smiled and said, ""I understand. You're always my good little girl!""
I shared my dress with my friend, and she shared her joy with me. That's friendship. And we are still best friends today!",middle3862.txt
