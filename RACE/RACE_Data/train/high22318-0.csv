In the past three decades, it has become a widespread social phenomenon. And with society and the economy developing at a faster pace, the condition of elderly couples has worsened.
Data shows that over half of the families in China are ""empty nest"" households, with the figure being as high as 70 percent in some big cities. There were 41.5 million ""empty nest"" old people aged 65 or above in 2010.Experts even say that ""empty nest"" families will become the major pattern in Chinese cities and rural areas, dealing a blow to the traditional family support system and requiring the government to take greater care of the material and spiritual needs of senior citizens and to provide them better psychological comfort, proper healthcare and legal aid. 
After retirement, people tend to participate in fewer social activities, spending more time at home reading newspapers or watching television. ""Empty nest"" people, who are not taken proper care of by their children, are bound to feel lonely, and are usually unwilling to engage in recreational activities, which leads to psychological problems. A survey shows that over half of the ""empty nest"" old suffer from mental problems to different degrees. Loneliness, anxiety and depression are the most common. 
Grown-up children are to take care of not only their parents, but also to respect their feelings, by having more heart-to-heart conversations with them. Family love plays an important role in providing mental comfort for the elderly. They should undertake the responsibility of visiting aged parents more often and making them feel wanted.

Senior citizens, too, should make an effort to release tension and prepare for a happy life in their twilight years. They should change their mentality and try to be less emotionally dependent on their children, develop hobbies, extend their social circle, and set new goals to make the rest of their life more interesting.
