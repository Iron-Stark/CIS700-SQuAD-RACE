She stayed at a hotel near the central market. She had seldom been to the city before, and was very excited about what she would find.

Please give generously .""Julia felt sorry for the beggar and she bent down and put a dollar coin into his bowl. ""Thank you."" he said. The same thing happened again the following day.
