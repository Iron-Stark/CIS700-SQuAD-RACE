2,B,"['The students themselves', 'The government', 'The organizer of the trip', ""The students' parents""]",_  will help pay for this trip according to the text.,"Hello, children and parents. Thank you all for coming to this meeting. I'd like to start by confirming that we will receive some money from the government for our school trip to Indonesia. 
We will receive approximately $1,300 per child, which will reduce the overall cost to you.
Now that we are sure to get the money, it is time to do some serious planning. We are sure that the trip will be very exciting for the children, especially if they have not traveled overseas before. There are many benefits to having some exposure to different places and cultures. Your children will be able to learn a lot about other people and cultures on this trip.
Leanne is with us tonight. Leanne, where are you? Put up your hand, Leanne, so that the people can see who you are. Thank you. Leanne went on the trip last year and will be happy to tell you .of her experiences and answer any questions you might have. We will hear from her a bit later in the meeting.
We only have five months to organize the trip. From past experience I can tell you that the time will go very quickly! So we need to start organizing the trip. This  is the agenda for tonight's meeting:
* Passport: when and how to apply for one
* Schedule: what places we will visit
* Health matters: what precautions you need to take, plus any special needs that your child may have
* Studying: description of the school and type of lessons your child will attend
* Money: paying for the trip, plus how much money your child should take
* Hotel: where we will be staying
*Clothing and personal items: what your children should take with them
Are there any other items that you would like to place on the agenda?",high20146.txt
