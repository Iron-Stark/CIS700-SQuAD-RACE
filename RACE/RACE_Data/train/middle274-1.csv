How dangerous it would be if there was a fire! Today is in winter. It's time for us to learn a lot more about fire, especially what to do if we are caught in a fire:
1. Shout out
If you smell smoke or see fire, shout out ""Fire!"" Shout as loudly as you can, because people may be asleep.
2. Call 119
Never try to put the fire yourself, even if it is a very small one! Get help from your parents or call 119.
3. Keep down close to the floor
If there is a lot of smoke in your room, keep down close to the floor.
4. Test the door
Test the door before you open it. If the door is cool, open it carefully. If the door is hot, do not open it! Try to find a different way out.
5. Get out
If you can, get out of your home as soon as possible.
6. Don't use the lift
Never use the lift during the fire. It may also go wrong.
7. Don't go back
Never go back into a burning building!",middle274.txt
