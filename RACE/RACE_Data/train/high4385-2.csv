2,C,"['Moody but firm.', 'Shy and demanding', 'Confident and friendly.', 'Tough and troublesome.']",Which of the following describes Susan?,"One day, Jack threw some papers on my desk. ""What's wrong?"" I asked. ""Next time you want to change anything, ask me first,"" he said, and left. I had made just one small change. But it's not that I hadn't been warned. My colleagues had said he was responsible for the resignations of the two previous secretaries. As the weeks went by, I came to look down on Jack.
After another of his episodes had left me in tears I stormed into his office. ""what?"" he said suddenly. ""Jack, the way you've been treating me is wrong. I've never had anyone speak to me that way. As a professional, it's wrong for me to allow it to continue,"" I said. Jack smiled nervously, ""Susan, I make you a promise that I will be a friend. I will treat you as you deserve to be treated, with respect and kindness.""
Jack avoided me the rest of the week, and never questioned my work again. I brought cookies to the office one day and left some on his desk. Another day I left a note: ""Hope your day is going great. "" Over the next few weeks, there were no more Jack episodes. One year later
I discovered I had breast cancer, and was scared. The statistics were not great for my long-term survival.
One day, however, Jack visited me in the hospital and silently handed me a bundle with several bulbs inside. ""Tulips ,"" he said. I smiled, not understanding. ""If you plant them when you get home, they'll come up next spring. I think you will be there to see them when they come up. Next spring you will see the colours I picked out for you."" Tears clouded my eyes and he left. I have seen those red and white striped  tulips push through the soil every spring for over ten years now. This past September the doctor declared me cured. At a moment when I was praying for just the right word, a man with very few words said all the right things. After all, that's what friends do.",high4385.txt
