0,C,"['a young man wanted to rob me of my bag', 'a young man ran by and wanted to brush my bag', 'a young man said sorry to me for touching my bag', 'a young man came hurriedly to help me with my bag']","When I was walking in the street ,   _   .","There is one word that is on the lips of Americans , day and night , ""Sorry"".
One time as I was walking on the street , a young man ran by hurriedly , brushing against my handbag . Even as he continued on his way , he turned back and said ""sorry"" to me . Even in a rush , he didn't forget to apologize .
One day , after I bought some apples , the salesman was giving me the change , but I wasn't ready for it , and a coin dropped on the ground, ""I'm sorry ,"" he said while bending down to pick it up . I was puzzled --why would he apologize when it was my fault ?
Another time , I stepped on a man's foot in an escalator . At the same time , we both said ""sorry"" . I thought it interesting : was it really necessary for him apologize ?
Later on , an American friend explained to me that according to the American ideas, the escalator is public place which everyone should be able to stand in . After someone occupies a position in the escalator , making it difficult for someone else to find a place to stand in , isn't it necessary to express an apology ?
During my stay in America , I gradually realized that when friction   occurs in daily life , Americans don't care much about who is responsible . If someone is troubled , a ""sorry"" is always necessary . Even if the other person is hurt , the ""sorry"" would cool tempers . Perhaps this is why I never saw anyone quarreling on the buses , subways or streets in America .",high1102.txt
