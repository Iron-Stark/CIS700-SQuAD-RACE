1,C,"['A great moment is coming!', 'How to teach my son.', ""A mother's letter to the world"", ""Don't be rude to my son!""]",Which is the best title of this passage?,"Dear World,
My son starts school today. It's going to be strange and new to him for some time. And I wish you would treat him gently.
You see, up to now, he has been king of his own room. He has been boss of the backyard. I have always been around to treat his wounds, and to comfort his feelings.
But now things are going to be different. This morning, he's going to walk down the front steps, wave his hand and start his life.
So, World, I wish you would take him by the little hand and teach him the things he will have to know. Teach him there are heroes, leaders and friends in this world. Give him quiet time to think over the mystery of birds in the sky, bees in the sun, and flowers on the green hill.
Teach him to believe in his own ideas, even if everyone else tells him he is wrong.
Teach him to stand and fight if he thinks he is right.
Teach him never to put a price on his heart and spirit.
Teach him gently, World, but don't love him too much, because only the test of fire makes fine steel. This is a big order, World, and see what you can do. He's such a little fellow.",middle2026.txt
