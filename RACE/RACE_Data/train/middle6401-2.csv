2,D,"['An ice-cream', 'Some strawberries and cream', 'Some bread with cream', 'Some fish']",What did the husband give to the wife?,"An eighty-year-old couple were having trouble with their memories . One day, they decided to see a doctor. The doctor told him that there was nothing serious, but he suggested that they should start writing things down to help them remember things. The couple thanked the doctor and left.
Later that night while watching TV, the old man got up from his chair and his wife asked, ""Where are you going?""   ""To the kitchen.""he said.
""Will you get me an ice-cream?"" asked the wife.
""Sure.""
Then his wife asked him to write it down.
""No, I can remember that,"" replied the husband.
""Well, I also want some strawberries and cream on top. You'd better write it down, or you will forget that,"" said the wife.
""No, I can remember that,"" the husband got a little unhappy and went into the kitchen.
After about 20 minutes, the husband returned with a plate of fish. The wife laughed, ""Haha! Your bad memory! I wanted some bread with cream.""",middle6401.txt
