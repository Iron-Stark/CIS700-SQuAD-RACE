You'd only be important if while you were visiting the President, there was a telephone call from the president of another country, and the President of the US said he was too busy to answer it. ""
The reporter turned to the third man. ""Do you think so?"" ""No, I don't."" he said. ""I don't think that makes the visitor important. That makes the President important. "" ""Then what would make the visitor important?"" the reporter and the other two men asked.
