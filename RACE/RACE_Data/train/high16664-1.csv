1,B,"['It is necessary to sweep out all the terrorists around the world.', 'It is not very reasonable to launch wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.', 'It is quite right to apply military forces upon other nations.', 'The days of an eye for an eye should never be gone.']",What is probably the author's attitude towards America's military actions abroad?,"The day began with clear sunlight and blue skies.It soon turned into years of war, economic breakdown and political division. Ten years after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11,2001, America has come out of the smoke a very different country.Nearly 3,000 people died on September 11.
Suddenly America had to wake up to the fact that not everyone loves the USS              A.Members of al-Qaeda, the militant group that earned out the attacks, were angry about US support for the Israelis
against Palestinians in the Middle East, about US troops in Saudi Arabia, and about sanctions  
against Iraq.
""September 11 and the years that followed were a shock to our national consciousness,"" said Nicholas Bums, American ambassador to NATO   at the time.The terrorists struck not only the buildings, but also Americans- faith in their power.The fear that America had lost control of events as widespread.
In the name of fighting terrorism, the US launched wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.More than 6,000 Americans have died.Tens of thousands of ordinary people in those countries have also lost their lives.
But deaths are only part of the story.The world was shocked by photographs of Americans torturing   Iraqis in Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad.David Goldstein, a reporter with The Kansas City Star, questioned American behavior: ""Has torturing so-called terrorists saved American lives or made the values we advocate around the world weaker? ..."" Is that what we've become?""
However, a brief moment of national unity did occur straight after 9/11.""Americans were coming together in an unusually powerful way ...in the ashes.We live in a bittersweet memory of that collective tragedy and collective possibility,"" said filmmaker Ken Burns.
September 11 was that kind of common moment.When it was over, the Harth still turned in its usual way and the stars in the sky shone as before.But the universe had shifted somehow.
Though the world felt the consequence of September 11, more is to come.Ten years on, it still might be too soon to tell.",high16664.txt
