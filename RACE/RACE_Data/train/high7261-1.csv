Perhaps the show's popularity should not be a surprise. Along with gunpowder and paper, many Chinese people consider the creation of Chinese calligraphy to be one of their primary contributions to civilization. Unfortunately, all over the country, Chinese people are forgetting how to write their own language without computerized help. Software on smart phones and computers allows users to type in the basic sound of the word using the Latin alphabet. The correct character is chosen from a list. The result? It's possible to recognize characters without remembering how to write them.

Soft music plays as a group of six-year-olds dip brush pens into black ink. They look up at the blackboard often to study their teacher's examples before carefully attempting to reproduce those characters on thin rice paper. ""If adults can survive without using handwriting, why bother to teach it now?"" we ask the calligraphy teacher, Shen Bin. ""The ability to write characters is part of Chinese tradition and culture,"" she reasons. ""Students must learn now so they don't forget when they grow up."" says the teacher.",high7261.txt
