1,D,"['Romina has won an Oscar Award', ""Romina's first movie was a short film"", 'Romina once worked as a cameraman', ""Romina's father was her first guide to filmmaking""]",We know from the passage that   _  .,"12-year-old Romina Mohaqqeq, believed to be Iran's youngest filmmaker, is dreaming of winning an Oscar someday. 
""I will not regard myself a filmmaker until I win an Oscar,"" she remarks. Born in 1998, she has so far directed several documentaries  and short films and has received several awards at national and international festivals. 
""I made my first documentary when I was eight years old. The idea came to my mind when I saw an Afghan boy who was collecting paper in a dustbin near our house. I thought it might be a good topic for a documentary,"" she said. 
""I asked my dad to make a movie about this boy but he said that it would not be an interesting topic. He told me to work on the topic myself if I liked it, so I made my first documentary and named it Long Way"".
Romina's ""Long Way"" took the best film award at Roshd International Film Festival in 2007, encouraging her to continue filmmaking. ""Next, I adapted a story published in a magazine and made the short film A Box Full of Affection"".
She is now working on Thought, a new documentary about positive thinking.
Romina admits that her dad has been her only advisor all these years.
""When Romina decided to work on a topic herself at the age of 8, I taught her the whole process of filmmaking within 6 to 7 months. I even worked as a cameraman in some of her productions."" her father said. 
""We also reviewed the book Film Directing Shot by Shot. We read all the sections together where she learned the entire process from pre-production to post-production.""
Romina also played in one of her dad's productions when she was 6, and acted in the
movie The Earrings. She was among the judges of 39th edition of the Roshd International
film Festival.",high21071.txt
