2,A,"[""Hilary's aunt's money."", ""Hilary Smith's debts."", 'The intended murder.', ""Hilary's aunt's marriage.""]",Which of the following is the focus of the story?,"Hilary Smith belonged to a good family.But by the age of twenty, he had spent all the money the good old family had.He then had some trouble with the bank and was put in prison.He escaped from the prison and ran to   Australia without delay.
Hilary did not like Australia. What he could do seemed to be one of two things: die or work.Then he remembered that he was not alone in the world.He had an aunt.
She was his father's only sister, but his father used to say she brought no glory to the family.Hilary, of course, tried to discover what she had done.It seemed that she had failed to marry a nobleman.Instead, she had chosen a husband who was connected with ""trade"".Of course as soon as she became ""Mrs Parks"" ,her brother considered her dead.Later on, Mr Parks died and left her a lot of money; but that did not bring her back to life in her brother's opinion.
Hilary discovered his aunt's address.Fortunately she remained faithful and honest to him even after she fell ill.So Hilary's star shone again, and soon he moved into her house and lived as comfortably as a sailor who had just reached harbour.He had only about a six pence in his pocket.
One thing was soon clear: his aunt was seriously ill, and nothing could cure her illness.Hilary was very worried.Fate had found a home for him, and was now going to throw him out of it.There was only one thing that could save him: her will.
""Will?"" she said, ""yes, I have made one.That was when I was a girl and had not much money.I left all my money to some religious people.""
""Didn't you make another will when you were married?"" Hilary asked.
His aunt shook her head.""No,"" she said in a low voice, ""There was no need.When I finally had a lot of money I found I had no relations.""
On the next day he went to the public library and examined a book of law.It told him what he already believed.When a woman is married, an earlier will lose its value.A new will must be made.If no new will is made, the money goes to the nearest relation.Hilary knew that he was his aunt's only relation.His future was safe.
After a few months had passed, Hilary's problems became serious.He badly needed money.He had expensive tastes, and owed a lot of money to shopkeepers.They trusted him because his aunt was rich; but the debt was terrible.
Unfortunately his aunt did not want to discuss money matters at all.In the end they had a quarrel about the small amount of ten pounds.Hilary was not very angry.He began to wonder about a new problem.Was it kind to want his aunt to live.any longer? Was it not better for her to die now? While he was considering what to do, his aunt told him that she was going to send for her lawyer.So she was going to make a new will, Hilary thought.She might leave all her money to someone else.Soon he reached a clear decision. _ 
One night when the old servant who had been nursing his aunt went off, he doubled the amount of some medicine.The total amount was too great and it could just put her to sleep forever.
""Thank you,"" his aunt took the glass from his hand with a grateful look.""I want more than anything to sleep, and never to wake up again.Is that what you wish, Hilary? Don't blame me if I have some doubts about what you intended to do.Sick people get these ideas, you know.One thing I ought to explain to you.Mr Parks never married me.He already had a wife and couldn't marry again.That made your foolish father very angry with me...Well, if I am alive tomorrow I shall make another will in your favour.If I die tonight, you'll get nothing...No, Hilary, don't try to take the glass away.If you do that, I shall know and I don't want to know.Goodnight, Hilary.""
Then, very carefully, she raised the glass to her mouth and drank.",high2120.txt
