1,A,"['Carl', 'Allan', 'Erik', 'Paul']",The man called   _   answered the question first.,"Three travelers, Allan, Carl and Paul were sitting on the chairs in a train station. They were waiting for a train that was very late.
To pass the time, they began talking to each other.
At first, they talked about the weather and their work. Then Paul said, ""Tell me--what would you most like to do if your doctor tell you that you have only three months to live?""
The other two men thought about this for a while, then Carl spoke.
""Well,"" he said, ""if I have only three months to live, I'll take all my money out of the bank and go to foreign countries for holidays with my best friend, Erik. I'd like to travel to the places in the world as many as possible. And I'll stay at the best hotels and then eat the best food. I think I'll have a wonderful time.""
""That's very interesting."" Paul said.
With these words, he turned to the other man, saying, ""And what about you?""
""I'll tell you a secret,"" Allan said. ""I always want to be a racing driver. So if I have only three months to live, the first thing I'd like to do is to sell my house. With the money I'll buy the fastest car in the world. Maybe I can enter all the big motor races.""
Then he laughed, ""I might even end up (......) world champion.""
""Now it's your turn,"" Allan went on, ""If your doctor tell you the bad news, what would you most like to do?""
""Oh,"" said Paul with a smile. ""I'll go and see another doctor.""",middle410.txt
