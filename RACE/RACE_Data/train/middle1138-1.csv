1,C,"['works late', 'writes things', 'keeps talking late', 'watches TV late']",Mr White's wife   _   every evening.,"Mr White works in an office. He's very busy and has no time to have a good rest. Every evening, when he comes back from his office, he's always tired and wants to go to bed early. But his wife often has a lot of interesting things to tell him after dinner. She doesn't stop talking until she falls asleep  . But it's usually too late and Mr White has to get up early in the morning when she is still sleeping.
One day Mr White felt terrible and couldn't go to work. He decided to go to see a doctor. Mrs White went to the hospital with him. Before her husband said what was the matter with him, the woman told the doctor all. The doctor wrote out a prescription  . When Mrs White took the medicine to the doctor's room, the doctor said to her, ""The bottle of medicine is for your husband and the pills   are for you. ""
""For me?"" the woman said in surprise. ""I'm fine. I don't need any medicine!""
""I don't think so, madam,"" said the doctor. ""They are sleeping pills. Your husband will be all right soon if you take them. """,middle1138.txt
