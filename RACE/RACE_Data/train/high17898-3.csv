3,A,"['Girls Get the Best out of Gap Years', 'Boys Lack Courage in Gap Years', 'For Fun or for Adventure?', 'Young Women Are More Adventurous']",Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?,"Young women are more adventurous than young men when traveling abroad in gap years. One in three female backpackers visits more than three countries during a year out and travels alone, according to new research.
By contrast, the majority of their male counterparts visit only one country and tend to travel in groups, says a survey by the Gap Year company, which provides information and services for students considering taking a year out.
More women than men say that their prime reason for taking time off is to see the world and experience different cultures. Men were more likely to rank ""having fun"" higher on their list of priorities. Women were more likely to value the challenge of a foreign trip, and many cited reasons such as learning a language and meeting new people.
The more adventurous gap years taken by women seem to work to their benefit: more than three quarters of those surveyed reported increased confidence, self-reliance and independence, whereas only half of the men had that experience.
The research also showed that women were more likely to do voluntary work while traveling, with more than one in ten helping with teaching or development projects. One of the reasons given for this is a wish to see the country in an authentic light.
A greater proportion of women than men faced objections or criticism from their families over their gap-year plans. Among the men surveyed, lack of money was the main barrier to travel.
Carolyn Martin, a doctor from London, was a typically confident female traveler.
Starting in Cape Town, she traveled around southern Africa and Australia with a string of unusual and sometimes dangerous jobs.
""I had one job chasing elephants off the runway in Africa by banging a stick against a pan,"" she recalled. ""It was OK but one day I did get chased by one.""
She said that she had traveled alone because ""you meet more people"".",high17898.txt
