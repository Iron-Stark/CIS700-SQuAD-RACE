2,B,"['a dog owner', 'a reporter', 'an advertiser', 'an expert on dog barks']",The writer of this passage is most likely to be  _  .,"Dog owners now have a little help understanding their furry friends . A new device called Bow-Lingual ""translates"" dog barks into English , Korea or Japanese.
Bow-Lingual's Japanese inventors spent much time and money analyzing dog barks . They found that dog noises can be broken down into six different emotions : happiness , sadness , frustration , anger , assertion and desire .
Part of the Bow-Lingual device hangs on the dog's collar . The other part is a handle-held unit for the owner . When the dogs barks , the unit displays translated phrases .
Some people have scoffed at Bow-Lingual. ""Who would pay US$ 120 to read a dog's mind?"" they ask .
But those who have purchased Bow-Lingual praise the device . Pet owner Keiko Egawa , of Japan , says it helps her empathize with her dog , Harry . ""Before we go to the park , he always says he wants to play,"" says Egawa , ""and after a walk , he always says he is hungry.""
Bow -Lingual is not yet available in Chinese . So you'd better keep studying Studio Classroom , or soon your dog may know more English than you do !",high1365.txt
