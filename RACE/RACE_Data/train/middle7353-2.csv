""Don't worry,"" Greg said. ""I have some golf gloves .You can use them to wash cars. and I will even help you to  wash the cars.""""Thank you!""Michael said.
After spending the day washing cars, Michael got enough money and went to the store with Greg. He found the game he wanted quickly, but as he took it off the shelf he saw a golf video game next to it.
