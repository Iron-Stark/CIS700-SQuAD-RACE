2,A,"['parents should allow their children more freedom', 'parents and children should not stay together', 'the younger generation should value the older generation', ""academic records are more important than one's inner world""]","In the view of the author,  _  .","Parents, our first teachers, play a highly significant role in our lives.However, doesn't it seem that many of us come to have conflicts with them when we start high school? We're less likely to listen to them and take their suggestions--we even rebel against them.
Why? It may be the so-called ""generation gap"".A generation gap appears when we begin to feel our parents
are ignoring us, don't understand us, and we feel we can no longer share our feelings with them.
The key reason is our desire for independence.In senior high school, we start to want to take responsibility for our own lives and make our own decisions.But parents resist this.They still want to control us and try to force us to do things they think we should do.Debate and discussion often come to nothing.Gradually, we talk with them less, and keep our feelings locked up inside.
Zhang Xiaoyun, 16, of Ningbo, Zhejiang, has talked less and less with her mother since she started senior high school.""She believes studies should be my priority, not my inner world,"" Zhang said.""Each day, she asks me the same old questions like, 'How was your last exam? or 'Have you made any progress in physics?"" To Zhang, these questions are annoying and so she always tries to ignore them and answers _ .""Sometimes, when I get upset, I quarrel with her.After, she comes to apologize and comfort me.But I know, she doesn't completely understand me,"" Zhang said.Now, a home that was once full of laughter has fallen into gloom and silence.
The generation gap can be harmful.Because of the lack of communication, our parents no longer know what we are thinking about.There are quarrels, even over trivial things.When that happens, we may not be able to concentrate on our studies.Some of us even become afraid to go home after school-- a very serious situation for the whole family.",high15056.txt
