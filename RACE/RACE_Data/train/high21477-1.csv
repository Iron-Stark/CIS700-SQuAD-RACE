1,A,"['most European consumers lack confidence in making responsible choices', 'companies can  make a higher profit by making less carbon-intensive products', 'people are buying sustainable products to have a lighter carbon footprint', 'companies have done enough to allow consumers to make greener choices']",The author is trying to inform the readers in the third passage that   _  .,"There is a forgotten player in the global efforts to limit C02 emissions:the consumer. Households consume one--third of the final energy used in the European Union and produce around two--thirds of city waste.Moreover,food,housing,and private transport account for almost 80%of environmental pressures.So consumers can make a real difference when it comes to fighting climate change.
Several factors can direct consumers towards more environmentally--friendly behavior. To achieve this,we need clear and simple information to guide consumption decisions. Indeed.Two thirds of consumers find it difficult to understand which products are better for the environment when shopping.
 With 58% of Europeans believing that many companies pretend to be green in order to charge higher prices, industry has a long way to go in helping consumers feet confident when making green choices.They should give consumers more information about the carbon footprint of their products,and promote more sustainable behavior among their customers.
To be sure, companies are increasingly creating product labels that help consumers make responsible choices--for instance, reminding users of products made from materials that are recycled,renewable, and/or less carbon--intensive.  Even so,only,20%  of Europeans believe that companies are doing enough to promote environmentally friendly options.
In times of crisis, consumers prefer high-quality products that will last long and won't go out of style.Durable products might sometimes cost more, but they don't need to be replaced as frequently. In this way,companies that create durable or recyclable products enable consumers to think differently about their purchases, which can help users behave more responsibly, and thus may help end our ""throw-way"" culture.
However,  it is not enough to inform consumers of the environmental features of products. We also need to provide consumers with guidance to establish a practical lifestyle model to follow. This cannot be brought about by regulations alone, but by good business communities that would create a loyal group of ""sustainable consumers"".",high21477.txt
