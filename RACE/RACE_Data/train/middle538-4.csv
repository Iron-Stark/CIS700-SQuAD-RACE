She often said. "" Give it to a poor man . "" But Mr. Jones always answered, "" No, I like this coat. ""
Then a cigarette  fell on it and made a hole in it. So Mrs Jones said, ""Please don't wear it again. "" Mr. Jones took it to a small tailor  "" Please make another coat like this one ."" The tailor made the coat very carefully. Then he lit  a cigarette, and made a hole in it in the same place.",middle538.txt
