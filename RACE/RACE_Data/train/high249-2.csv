But today teenagers and their parents argue over something else: money.
Children are spending lots of it. Parents used to say to their children, ""You're wearing that?"" Now they say, ""You paid how much for that?""
Children in the US today spend five times more money than their parents did when they were young.
So what are all these children buying? The list is long: ipods trainers , cellphones and jeans are typical items that children ""have to"" buy. And they will do anything to get them. They ask their parents over and over until they buy them.
But parents also need to take the blame for spending so much money. They want their children to have the best stuff. They end up competing with other parents over what their children have.
