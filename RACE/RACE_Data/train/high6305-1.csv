1,B,"['It was hard for her to improve her level.', 'She suffered from a foolish rule.', 'Her family life took up too much of her time.', ""She didn't want to improve her level.""]",Why did Fukuda remain at fifth-degree black belt for so long a time?,"Just two years before her 100thbirthday, Sensei Keiko Fukuda has become the first woman to achieve a tenth-degree black belt --- the highest rank in the martial art and combat sport judo . Fukuda is now one of only four living people who've earned the tenth-degree (or dan) black belt. Throughout history, only sixteen people have ever achieved this honor.
Fukuda began practicing judo in 1935 and is the only surviving student of its founder, Kano Jiguro. Urged by her teacher, she learned English to help spread judo internationally.
During a time when getting married, building a family, and becoming a housewife was the standard, Fukuda went against tradition, _ marriage to pursue the martial art.
""All I did was judo ... this was my marriage,"" Fukuda reflected tearfully to the San Francisco Chronicle. ""This is when my life destiny was set. I just never imagined how long this road would be.""
She described the Jiguro's school, known as the Kodokan, as ""old-fashioned and sexist  about belts and ranks"". In fact, an order that prevented women from achieving any higher than a fifth-degree black belt kept Fukuda at that level for thirty years. She was finally promoted to sixth dan in 1972 when a woman's division was created.
Fukuda said she approached judo and her life with the intention to ""be gentle, kind and beautiful, yet firm and strong, both mentally and physically"". Fukuda said this kind of beauty is decidedly not external  . "" A kind soul is inner beauty,"" she explained to the paper. ""I believe this is true beauty ... All my life this has been my dream.""
Dream realized, the 98-year-old Sensei Keiko Fukuda continues to teach judo three times a week at a woman's judo.",high6305.txt
