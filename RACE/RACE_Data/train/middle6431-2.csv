What does the word ""home"" mean to you? How do you say the word in French? In Chinese? In your language? Although people usually know what the word means, it sometimes has no exact translation. It's not surprising, because the idea of home is "" different from country to country and from person to person"". A home is more than a roof and four walls. It's the cooking ,eating, talking, playing and sleeping that go on inside. And at home you usually feel safe and relaxed.
Homes look different in different countries. They also have different things inside. For example, in cold northern Europe, there's a fire in the living room or kitchen and all the chairs face it, In the south, where the sun shines a lot and it's more important to keep the heat out, there are small windows and cool stone floors.
