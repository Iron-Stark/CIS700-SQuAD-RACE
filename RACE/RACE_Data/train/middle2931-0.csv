0,C,"['Wang Ling told her mother she might fall in love with a boy.', ""Jiang's mother doesn't care about her at all."", ""Puppy love will be bad for student's study."", 'Puppy love becomes a problem for all students.']",What can we learn from the article?,"Wang Ling, a middle school girl, felt angry with her parents after getting a boy's phone call. ""A classmate called me to discuss homework. We talked for just a few minutes before my parents got mad,"" said the girl. ""They asked whether I liked the boy. I'm sad Ididn't, but they wouldn't believe me.""
Wang's trouble is not strange at all because puppy love becomes a big headache for both parents and schools. They worry that puppy love will be bad for their study. Her school makes it a rule not to allow any talk or any _ between one boy and one girl alone.
Many students say they understand why parents and teachers are so nervous about puppy love. But some think they are going too far. ""We have our own thoughts and we know what to do with it."" said Wang Ling.
Another girl, Jiang Ting, liked making friends with boys. ""Boys and girls can learn from each other,"" she said. ""My mother asks me to study hard. However, she never stops me from making friends with boys."" Once Jiang Ting told her mother she might fall in love with a boy. Her mother let Jiang make her own decision. Soon Jiang found that she didn't like him any more because the boy was not as good as what she had thought before. And she did worse and worse in her subjects because she spent much on it. At last she understood the worry from school and most parents about puppy love.",middle2931.txt
