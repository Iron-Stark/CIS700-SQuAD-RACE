3,C,"['Zambia only has two World Heritage Sites.', 'The Barotse Landscape has been partly destroyed.', 'The Barotse Landscape issue is still being discussed.', ""Young people in Zambia don't know about Barotse culture.""]",What can we infer from the text?,"The Regional Director of the National Heritage Conservation Commission   Kagosi Mwamulowe said the Barotse Plains is unique and it deserves to be on the list of the World Heritage Sites.
Mr. Mwamulowe said the Barotse Plains deserves to be included on the World Heritage List because it has a rich cultural heritage which includes the burial sites of former kings.
The Director said he hoped that the landscape would be declared as a heritage site next year in June. He also said it was important to protect Zambia's unique culture for education and entertainment.
Chief Natural Heritage Officer Muyumbwa Ndiyoi said there will be a lot of benefits when the Barotse Landscape is declared a World Heritage Site because it will attract many tourists and business investments   will increase.
Mr. Ndiyoi said the site will also benefit young people as knowledge will be passed down from generation to generation.
He was reacting to a question from Nalolo District Labour Officer Jason Ngoma who wanted to know how the people of Western Province will benefit once the Barotse Landscape is declared a World Heritage Site.
And University of Zambia Lecturer Charles Namate said there is a need for the site to be included on the World Heritage List because 50 years after its independence Zambia only has one heritage site, which is the Victoria Falls.
Lecturer Namate said the Barotse Landscape was facing a lot of environmental degradation  , and that's why there is a need to recognize the value of its landscape and the memories of dead kings.
The National Heritage Conservation Commission together with the Ministry of Chiefs and Traditional Affairs are in Western Province to hold meetings with Heads of Government Departments. The Commission also held closed-door meetings with the Litunga Lubosi Imwiko II of the Barotse Royal Establishment.",high13405.txt
