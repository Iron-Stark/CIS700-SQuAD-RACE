4,A,"['A special Christmas', 'How to choose Christmas gifts.', 'Three kind women.', 'My first Christmas.']",What's the best title for the passage?,"I will never forget the year when I was 12.My mother told us that we would not get Christmas gifts because there was not enough money .I felt sad and thought, ""What shall I say when the other kids ask me about my gifts?"" I started to hope the Christmas wouldn't come that year. Just then three women came to our house with gifts for all of us. For me,they brought a doll .I felt so happy.
Years later, my life changed a lot. So one Christmas, I wanted to do something special. I asked forty friends to help me. We visited 125 orphans to come to our Christmas party. For every child, we prepared a beautiful gift.
Finally the moment came. I called out,"" One, two, three. Open your gifts!"" As the children opened their boxes, the whole room was full of their bright smiles. The feeling I got from that Christmas so long ago came again.",middle661.txt
