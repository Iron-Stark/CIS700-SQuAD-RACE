2,A,"['it is unfair to blame English teachers for language deficiencies of students', 'to improve the level of English requires the effort of several generations', 'English should not be the target of the blame of language deficiencies', 'to rid language deficiencies one should have sensitive eyes and ears']",In the passage the author argues that   _  .,"The speaker, a teacher from a community college, addressed a sympathetic audience. Heads nodded in agreement when he said, ""High school English teachers are not doing their jobs."" He described the weaknesses of his students, all high school graduates who can use language only at a grade 9 level. I was unable to determine from his answers to my questions how this grade 9 level had been established.
What the speaker was really saying is that he is no longer young; he has been teaching for sixteen years, and is able to think and speak like a mature adult.
My point is that the frequent complaint of one generation about the one immediately following it is unavoidable. It is also human nature to look for the reasons for our dissatisfaction. Before English became a school subject in the late nineteenth century, it was difficult to find the target of the blame for language deficiencies  . But since then, English teachers have been under constant attack.
The complainers think they have hit upon an original idea. As their own command of the language improves, they notice that young people do not have this same ability. Unaware that their own ability has developed through the years, they suppose the new generation of young people must be hopeless in this respect. To the eyes and ears of sensitive adults, the language of the young always seems inadequate .
Since this concern about the decline and fall of the English language is not recognized as a generational phenomenon but rather as something new and strange to today's young people, it naturally follows that today's English teachers cannot be doing their jobs. Otherwise, young people would not commit crimes against the language.",high16897.txt
