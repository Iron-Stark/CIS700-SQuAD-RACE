G. Wells, an English writer, wrote a book describing a trip to the moon. When the explorers landed on the moon, they discovered that the moon was full of underground cities.
They showed their surprise to the ""moon people"" they met. In turn, the ""moon people"" showed their surprise. ""Why,"" they asked, ""are you traveling to outer space when you don't even use your inner space?""
H. G. Wells could only imagine travel to the moon. In 1969, human beings did land on the moon. People today know that there are no underground cities on the moon. However, the question that the ""moon people"" asked is still an interesting one. A growing number of scientists are seriously thinking about _ .
Underground systems are already in place. Many cities have underground car parks. In some cities, such as Tokyo, Seoul and Montreal, there are large underground shopping areas. The ""Channel"", a tunnel connecting England and France, is now completed.
But what about underground cities? Japan's Taisei Corporation is designing a network of underground systems, called ""Alice Cities"". The designers imagine using surface space for public parks and using underground space for flats, offices, shopping, and so on. A solar dome would cover the whole city.
