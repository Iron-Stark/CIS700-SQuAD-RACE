1,C,"['The free food and transportation.', 'The famous music teacher.', 'The chance to learn new things.', 'The strict discipline rules.']",What attracts children to join in the program to learn music?,"Tabb doesn't look like a typical music teacher. But every weekday evening in the French Quarter New Orleans, he beats out the rhythm on his music stand as students play their chosen instruments.
""I'm doing my best to take young people away from harmful things,"" said Tabb. His program,  ""The Roots of Music"", offers free music education to more than 100 students. He struggles to _ in the city with the nation's highest murder rate .
Tabb chose to target 9to14yearolds with his program. ""That's a very important time in your life,"" he said. ""If I catch them then, I can hold onto them for at least four or five years and guide them the way that will lead them to success.""
Students meet from 4 pm to 7 pm every weekday, all year round. They work with tutors  on schoolwork, practice their music and eat a hot meal before heading home. With the money provided by some people, Tabb's group is able to provide bus transportation, instruments and food for free. He calls it his ""no excuse"" policy. ""You have no excuse why you're not here,"" Tabb said. Tabb owes the success in part to the nature of music. ""You're always learning something new,""he said. ""That's what keeps the kids coming back every day.""
But the program isn't only about fun. ""Music is about discipline  ,""said Tabb. He insists on good behavior and keeps kids in order with threats of situps , pushups  or tasks like picking up grains of rice -- but these measures aren't just punishment. Tabb wants young people to realize that music can help them build a better future. ""I don't say that I'm saving lives,"" he said. ""I say I'm giving life -- a whole different life of music.""",high2863.txt
