2,D,"['The Disneyland parade started in the evening.', 'The daughter was older than the son.', 'The grandma was shorter than the mother.', 'They got back to their hotel by bus that day.']",Which of the following is not true?,"When my two children were young, we took a trip to Disneyland with their grandma. Although the park is about an hour car ride from our home, we decided to spend the night in a hotel, so we could spend more time in the park. In the evening, the famous Disneyland Parade started. My husband took our daughter and ran to have a look, leaving me with grandma and our son who was in a stroller  .
Because I am short, and grandma is shorter, we couldn't see them, and didn't know where they were. Grandma decided to find them. I told her not to, because I didn't want to lose her. But she walked off, and was soon lost. I made my way to the exit , because I thought everyone would get there, and they did. Then we waited for the hotel bus ----it  never came. So we called them. They told us that there was something wrong with their bus, and that we have to take a taxi. We finally got back to our hotel.
Today when I think of Disneyland, I think of that day.",middle1976.txt
