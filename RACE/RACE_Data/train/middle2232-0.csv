Welcome to Banktown Bushwalking   Club! Here are some things you need to know:
Most walks are in faraway places. You need to take enough food and water for a full day of activity on each walk. This is the most important thing to remember.
Wear good lace-up shoes, because you need to do some climbing sometimes.
Each walk has a grade. If you haven't been bushwalking before, we suggest that you start with an easy walk- Grade 1 or 2. If you have been bushwalking before, then a Grade 3 walk may be suitable.
All beginners need to call or e-mail the leader of an activity 48 hours before the start of the activity. They need to make sure that you are fit and able to finish the activity as planned.
