Some scientists imagine that this could even mean the beginning of another ice age. The effects of such a change in climate on the human population of the world would be amazing.
Recent research suggests that the general warming trend of the past hundred years or so may be coming to an end. During the past ten years, meteorologists tell us the average temperature of the earth has dropped about one degree Fahrenheit. This does not seem like much, but it could have effects on wind and rain patterns which influence the overall weather picture. If these patterns change a lot, it could mean that certain regions of the world may continue to have long droughts while others will possibly suffer from widespread flooding. 
What regulates the climate is not exactly known. Meteorologists believe that clouds may be an important factor in regulating the amount of solar heat held by the earth, which in turn determines the temperature of the planet. Another possibility is that man's industrial and agricultural methods may be affecting the natural weather patterns. However, the weather is not understood well enough for scientists to say for certain what is happening to the climate and what side effects this will actually have on the world's population.",high18400.txt
