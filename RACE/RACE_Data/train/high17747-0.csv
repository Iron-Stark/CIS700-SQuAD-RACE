0,A,"['heart disease', 'cancer', 'lose of memory', 'aspirin side effects']",The new report clearly benefits the women suffering,"According to decades-long research, women who took low to moderate  daily doses of aspirin had a reduced death rate, especially from heart disease.
The research, based on data from a major trial that has tracked almost 80,000 women since 1976, found that women who reported using aspirin on a regular basis had a 25 percent lower risk of death from any cause than women who didn't take the drug.
  The risk of death from cardiovascular  disease was 38 percent lower for aspirin users, and there was also a 12 percent reduction in cancer deaths that took effect after a decade of aspirin use, the researchers found in their report based on the Nurses' Health Study.
However, an accompanying editorial in the journal cautioned that the results were open to debate and far from definitive.      
The dissenting   editorial was based on results of an earlier trial by the Women's Health Study, which followed almost 40,000 women for 11 years and found no reduction in overall deaths. Therefore, the new findings ""cannot overcome the accumulated evidence that aspirin is not particularly effective for the primary prevention of death from cardiovascular disease in women.""
      ""This is a complicated issue,"" said Dr. Andrew T. Chan, leading author of the new report. ""We understand that aspirin has potential health benefits, but who would aspirin therapy  be appropriate for?"" There are ""areas of disagreement that need further study"" before that question can be answered, Chan said. But there is information from the two large studies and other trials that can help guide women and their physicians, he said. And anyone who is thinking about daily aspirin ""should really talk with doctors about the benefits and risks.""",high17747.txt
