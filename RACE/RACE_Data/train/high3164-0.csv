0,D,"['Your brain will become smaller.', 'You will never get help from authority.', 'You will hardly know the world.', 'Your own intelligence will stop growing.']",What will happen if you refuse to follow your own understanding according to the above passage?,"Never argue with one's own understanding.
The whisper of intelligence is always there, whatever you do.
If you create a time lag   between the whisper of intelligence and understanding in you and your action, then you are preventing the brain from growing into a new size. When you argue with intelligence, when you postpone acting according to understanding then there is confusion, the brain gets confused.
The voice of understanding, the voice of intelligence has insecurity about it. How do you know that it is the right thing?
So we tend to ignore it. Instead we accept authority. We obey.
But the brain cannot be orderly, competent, accurate and precise if you do not listen to it, if you have no respect. We are so busy with the outside world and its force that the world that is inside us does not command that respect and reverence  , that care and concern from us.
So one has to be a disciple   of one's own understanding, and look upon that understanding as the master.
Sometimes one may commit a mistake, it might be the whim   of the ego and we might mistake the whim, the wish of the ego for the voice of silence and intelligence, but that we have to discover. Unless you commit mistakes, how do you learn to discriminate between the false and the true? In learning there is bound to be a little insecurity, a possibility of committing mistakes. Why should one be terribly afraid of committing mistakes?
So instead of accepting the authority of habits and conditionings, while one is moving one watches, and when there is a suggestion, do not neglect, ignore, or insult the whisper from within and from one's own intelligence.",high3164.txt
