I've seen friends deal with _ in all kinds of different ways. One strict mother insisted that her son, right from a child, should stand up whenever anyone entered the room, open doors and shake hands like a gentleman. I saw him last week when I called round. Sprawling himself   on the sofa in full length, he made no attempt to turn off the loud TV he was watching as I walked in, and his greeting was no more than a quick glance at me. His mother was ashamed. ""I don't know what to do with him these days,"" she said. ""He's forgotten all the manners we taught him.""
He hasn't forgotten them. He's just decided that he's not going to use them. She confessed   that she would like to come up behind him and throw him down from the sofa onto the floor.
