What is the point of the article?,"The wedding between Prince Wiliam and Kate Middleton on April 29 has focused the world's camera lenses   on the UK.
In Britain, there is a constant debate about the relevance  of the royal family to modern British society. However, Windsor (the family name of the British Royal Family) and Middleton have been seen to represent a more modern, forward-looking nation.
Nigel Baker, the British ambassador to Bolivia, believes that the royal wedding is ""about modern   Britain"". ""The estimated 2 billion spectators across the world will see that Britain is one of the most culturally and ethnically diverse nations in the world, home to 270 nationalities speaking 300 different languages, founded on tolerance and respect for difference,"" wrote Baker on his blog.
According to Baker, the wedding could help viewers to see ""why Britain is one of the most dynamic and creative countries in the world"": The television on which most people watched the event was invented by John Logie Baird, a Briton, and the World Wide Web that broadcast the event to millions more was invented by another Briton, Tim Berners-Lee.
The guests who attended the wedding ceremony gave more than a few clues as to the nature of modern Britain. David and Victoria Beckham represent Britain's obsession  with football and celebrity.
Leaders from different religious backgrounds supported Baker's comments on the multicultural nature of modern British society.
Before the wedding, David Elliott, arts director of the British Council China, agreed that the wedding would be a showcase for modern Britain: ""I think, and hope, that it (modern British influence) would be values like openness, multiculturalism, creativity, sense of humor and the traditional British sense of fair play,"" he said.
Furthermore, events such as the Olympics in London in 2012 may also increase people's sense of Britishness.
According to a poll published in Daily Telegraph, more than a third of people in the UK admitted they felt ""very British"" when watching the Olympics.",high12077.txt
