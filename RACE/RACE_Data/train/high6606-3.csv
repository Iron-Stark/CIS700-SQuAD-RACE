3,B,"['She mailed letters to them.', 'She delivered messages by hand.', 'she sent them an email.', 'She talked to all her neighbors.']",How did Jenny tell her neighbors about her new business?,"Jenny found her old bicycle at the back of the garage.It was a lot smaller than she remembered.When she sat on it and put her feet on the pedals,her knees nearly touched her chin. She then asked her dad for a new bicycle.
""Well,I'm sorry,but I can't afford a bicycle now,""said Dad.""Why don't you work and earn some money? You can save up for a bicycle yourself.""
Jenny began to work.That day she earned five dollars for cutting the grass and ten dollars for mowing the lawn for her dad.
That night Jenny went on the computer.She wrote""Gardening and Housework--Ten dollars an hour.Call Jenny at 23 Roseville Lane.""She decorated the page with pictures of cleaning and gardening equipment.She printed it fifty times.Then she posted the pages through all the doors on her street.
That week,Jenny was very busy! Lots of people had jobs to do,but they didn't have time to do them.So they called Jenny.Every day,Jenny rushed home from schoo1.She did her homework quickly,and then she went out to work.
At the end of the week.she had$65! She told her father.
""That's enough for a second hand bicycle.""he said.
""Yes,but if I work for one more week,I might have enough money for a new bike,""said Jenny.""In two more weeks,I could buy a really good bicycle! I think that's what I'll do. I want to have the best bicycle in the class,because I earn it myself!""
Jenny's dad hugged her.""I think you learned something important.We appreciate things a lot more when we earn them.When we get something without earning it,we do not realize its true value.""",high6606.txt
