Bush is expected to issue a directive in the next few weeks. It will give the US Air Force a green light for the development of space weapons, US media reported last week.
This would potentially start a new global arms race, some experts have warned.

There are many barriers to the setting up of this kind of program, experts say. 
First is the coast.  It is estimated that the budget may be US $220 billion to US $ 1 trillion  .
