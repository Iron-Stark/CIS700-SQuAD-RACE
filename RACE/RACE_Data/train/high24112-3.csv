3,C,"['Farmers can grow more rice and shaky Internet communications can work better', 'How far advanced science and technology has gone', 'High school students can make great contributions to the world in many fields.', 'How some of the discoveries get regularly published']",What does the writer mainly want to tell us?,"Farmers could grow more rice and shaky Internet communications could work better someday, thanks to prize-winning discoveries by teenage scientists showed at a national science fair on Monday.
   High school scientists from across the United States showed off work in genetics, molecular  biology, mathematics and other fields that judges said rose to the professional level.
   ""It just blows me away. They're all just unimaginable,"" said Joel Spencer, aprefix = st1 /New YorkUniversityprofessor who served as judge at the Sidemen's Westinghouse Competition in Math, Science and Technology.
   Research done by finalists in the nationwide competition could lead to faster Internet speeds, more effective antibacterial drugs and better energy conservation. One team researched black holes in outer space, while another examined more than 700 fossils to better understand why dinosaurs died out.
   Juliet Girard and Roshan Prabhu won $ 100,000 scholarship for their work proving genes that help some kinds of wild rice flower earlier than others.
   Drawing on a database that described the genetic makeup of rice, the two students, fromJersey City,New Jersey, identified two genetic sections that directed wild rice to blossom an average of 10 days earlier than the ordinary short-grain rice that feeds much of the world.
Their discovery could allow genetic engineers to develop a new strain that would take less time to reach maturity, allowing farmers to produce more and extending the growing region into colder climates. 
Steven Byrnes of Lexington,Massachusetts, took the top individual prize for his theory describing outcomes in a two-player game called Chomp.",high24112.txt
