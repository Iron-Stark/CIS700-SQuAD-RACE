1,A,"['By car', 'By bike', 'By bus', 'By train']",How does he go to his office?,"I am a writer. My job is to write something for the newspaper. I work very hard. Every morning I get up at seven. I take some exercise and then have a light breakfast. Then I drive to my office. It takes me thirty minutes, so I usually get there earlier than others.
I am very busy. I think every minute counts, so I plan my work very carefully. I keep a diary to help me remember things. I meet and talk with many people. I make lots of telephone calls. I often go out and visit many people. I come back home at seven. I often watch TV at supper time. Then I begin to write down what I know. I like being busy.",middle95.txt
