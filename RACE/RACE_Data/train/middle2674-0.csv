0,D,"['Half an hour.', 'Two hours and a half.', 'Only a day.', 'Three hours or more.']",How long did the writer spend studying every day?,"The summer vacation is over. It's true that time flies.
In the vacation, the weather was very hot, but I enjoyed myself.
I did my homework in the morning. I got up at 6:30a.m. and took a walk in the garden for half an hour. After breakfast I began reading English and Chinese and did some math exercises. It usually took me three hours or more. I worked quite hard and I made great progress .
I spent the afternoon outside. I went swimming and it was fun. I would not go home until it was about five or six o'clock. Sometimes my friends came to see me and we spent some time listening to music.
In this way I spent my vacation happily. I not only studied hard, but also became a good swimmer. Now I'm in good health and high spirits .",middle2674.txt
