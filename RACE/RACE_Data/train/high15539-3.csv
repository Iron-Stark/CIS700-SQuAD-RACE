3,A,"['Recognition.', 'Pride.', 'Cheers.', 'Reward.']",What did Fran Tarkenton expect while watching the game films?,"Everyone needs recognition  for his achievements,but few people make the need known quite as clearly as the little boy who said to his father,""Let's play darts .I'll throw and you should say 'Wonderful!'""
Fran Tarkenton,former Minnesota Vikings quarterback,once called a play that required him to block onrushing tacklers.
FEL quarterbacks almost never block.They're usually vastly outweighed by defenders,so blocking exposes them to the risk of severe injury.
But the team was behind,and a surprising play was needed.Tarkenton went into block,and the runner scored a touchdown.The Vikings won the game.
Watching the game films with the team the next day,Tarkenton expected a big pat on the back for what he'd done.    It never came.
After the meeting,Tarkenton approached coach Bud Grant and asked,""You saw my block,didn't you,Coach?How come you didn't say anything about it?""
Grant replied,""Sure,I saw the block.It was great,but you're always working hard out there,Fran.I figured I didn't have to tell you.""
""Well,""Tarkenton replied,""if you ever want me to block again,you do!""",high15539.txt
