My parents have never driven me to soccer practice.This was mostly because we never had heard of soccer.I had a bicycle that weighed probably 50 pounds, and only had one speed.We didn't have a television in our house until I was 11.I was 13 when I tasted my first pizza; it was called ""pizza pie"".When I bit into it, I burned the roof of my mouth and the cheese slid off, swung down, plastered itself against my chin and burned that, too.It's still the best pizza I ever had.
I delivered newspapers, six days a week .The paper cost 7 cents, of which I got to keep 2 cents.I had to get up at 4:00 a.m.every morning.On Saturday, I had to collect the 42 cents from my customers.My favourite customers were the ones who gave me 50 cents and told me to keep the change.
