0,C,"['Long Loving Hugs', 'My Future', ""Don't Hope. Decide"", 'Love Is Everywhere']",The best title of the passage may be   _  .,"While waiting to pick up a friend at the airport in Portland, Oregon, I had an experience which occurred merely two feet away from me.
Trying to locate my friend among the passengers coming through the jet way, I noticed a man walking toward me carrying two light bags. He stopped right next to me to greet his family.
First he kissed his three children one by one and said, ""It's nice to see you. I missed you so much!"" Then he hugged his wife, ""I've saved the best for last!"" giving her the longest, most passionate kiss I ever remember seeing. They stared at each other's eyes, smiling at one another, while holding both hands. For an instant they reminded me of newlyweds , but I knew by the age of their kids that they couldn't  possibly be.
Full of admiration, I asked, ""Wow! How long have you two been married?"" ""Being together for fourteen years total, married twelve of those."" He replied, without breaking his gaze from his lovely wife's face. ""Well, then, how long have you been away?"" I asked. ""Two whole days!"" ""Two days?"" I was astonished. By the intensity   of the greeting, I had assumed he'd been gone for at least several weeks --- if not months. I knew _ so I turned away my eyes and said quietly, ""I hope my marriage is still that passionate after so long!""
The man suddenly stopped smiling and looked me straight in the eye. With forcefulness he told me something that left me a different person. ""Don't hope, friend...decide!"" Then he smiled again, shook my hand and said, ""God bless!""
With that, he and his family turned and walked away together.
I was still watching that man and his special family walk just out of sight when my friend came up to me and asked, ""What are you looking at?"" Without hesitation, and with a curious sense of certainty, I replied, ""My future!""",high514.txt
