Students like this lesson because there are no exams or boring classes. And they can learn how to save lives and know how to stop danger before it really happens.
Chen Haoyu, a teacher at BeijingNo.25 Middle School, gibes young students advice on how to deal with danger.
If you are in a traffic accident: If a car hits you, you should remember the car number. If it is a bike, try to call your parents before you let the rider go. This is because you don`t know how seriously you are hurt.
If it is raining hard and there is lightning:Don`t stay in high places and stay away from trees.
When there is a fire :Get away as fast as you can .Put wet things on your body and try to find an exit. Do not take the lift.
If someone is drowning: If you can`t swim ,don`t get into the water. Cry out for help.
Remember that danger is never as far away as you think. Take care of yourself at all times!
