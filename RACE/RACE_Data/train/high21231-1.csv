1,B,"['the sense of responsibility.', 'a weak bond with parents.', 'feeling depressed or stressed', ""the child's confidence.""]","According to the text, what will lead the child to get into trouble?","If the child has been brought up in a loving, openly communicative environment, the relationship with parents would be a strong one.It is only when there are ongoing troubles in the relationship between parents and the child that there is a breakdown in communication.
When parents are going through difficulties in their own relationship the child sometimes develops guilt.The child can hold himself or herself responsible for the breakdown in relationship between the parents.This needs to be explained to the child, who won't speak out this guilt.
The teenage years are emotionally sensitive years to the outside world.For the first time the child realizes his or her position in society.Friends suddenly become more important than parents.It is during this time that the relationship between children and parents is tested.If the bond with parents is strong, the child will not be swayed by the drug and alcohol culture.If the bond is weaker, the child will end up with problems.
During such times, one of the effective ways to deal with the problems is to discuss the problem with the child.As parents, you will need to discuss the consequences of each option and then leave the final decision to the child.Forcing parental will on children is counterproductive, especially at this age.Imposing parental will at this time will stop communicating and then you will not know what is happening in their life.Whatever the problem is, the child need never be made to feel lonely.The moment that happens, the possibility of serious self-harm is raised.
Any problem at this age can be dealt with by a flexible approach by parents.Discuss things calmly.Leave the decision to the individual.Make yourself available for any help or support that the child desires.The child will feel comfortable when allowed the freedom of choice.",high21231.txt
