2,C,"['The band copied from it other musicians.', 'It had already existed in the iPhones before they bought them.', 'The band created it with the help of the applications in the iPhones.', 'The band made full use of the traditional instruments to make the song.']",How did the video come into being?,"Armed only with iPhones, the inventive rock band Atomic Tom has gone viral  by way of the New York subway. The band has scored an Internet hit with the video to the song    ""Take Me Out.""
Singer Luke White says the production was a top-secret operation.
""We didn't tell anyone about this. It was completely top-secret from our family, from our friends, from our label, our management, everybody. So the first time that people saw this video was last Friday when we put it on YouTube,""explained White.
Since uploading the video to YouTube, band members have spent several days refreshing the page to watch the number of hits rise.
The video has also made its way around Twitter as many people have shared it with their friends.
""I mean, it still hasn' t quite hit.It' s just kind of blowing our minds right now that we're getting this: ma ny people are fond of it, and they' re sharing it with their friends.We don' t know what it's like really to have something that's viral, so all of this is very new to us."" said Eric Espiritu, the lead guitarist of the band.
White explains how the video came together:
""We did our research with the applications( ) and found applications that worked out really well with the instruments and then we plugged them all into, plugged our phones into mini-battery powered amplifiers  that we put underneath our seats, and we did a lot of, you know, practices, in terms of figuring out what the balance of the sound and like who was overpowering, who was too loud or who was too soft."" 
The idea for the video came from Espiritu's younger brother Benjamin. The younger Espiritu directed the video from his initial concept through the final edit and upload to the Internet. 
""I' ve seen a lot of the music applications come out, and I' ve never actually had the chance to play with them,""says Ben Espiritu. ""When I started hearing about how they sound and e verything, I thought it might be unique to take it one step further and then create an entire band just performing solely  on the iPhones, and I thought it would be a pretty cool idea.""
Ben says the success of the band' s music video is a credit to the talent and ability of the musicians, but it' s also a sign of the times.
""It really comes down to seeing something different, seeing something unique, and I think that that' s always, in any type of art form, what will speak to people, and I think it does reflect the times that we live in, taking a smart phone and then being able to turn it into an instrument, not only just an instrument, but making it sound really good.""",high20055.txt
