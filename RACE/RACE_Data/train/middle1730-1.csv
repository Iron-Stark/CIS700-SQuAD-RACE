1,D,"['Talk about money.', 'Talk about study.', 'Talk about the place you want to go.', 'Talk about the hotel.']",What is the quick way to find if you have the same habit of spending holiday with a_partner?,"If you want to travel with a partner, you may ask for one on the Internet. There are some tips about how to choose a right partner on the Internet:
Unluckily, you can't ask a person if he has a good feeling. If you ask, everyone will tell you that they do! It is important that you have to get to know your travel partner to find out what kind of feeling he really has.
You can tell a lot about a person's feeling by the words he uses. Ask him about his worst trip. Is he laughing about it now, or still unhappy? Does his worst trip sound like an _ to you? If so, he doesn't match you. Having a good feeling is important for having a good time.
Talk about the hotel you would like to stay in. See if you have the same habit of spending holidays. This is such a quick way to find a partner.
What's more? Always keep in contact with  your travelling partner when travelling. Don't simply hang out without telling them, and don't let them do it to you, either.",middle1730.txt
