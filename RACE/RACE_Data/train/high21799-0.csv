0,C,"['ensuring harmonious relationships', 'sharing responsibility with group members', 'achieving a goal', 'identifying new leaders']",The passage indicates that instrumental leaders generally focus on,"According to sociologists, there are several different ways in which a person may
become recognized as the leader of a social group in the United States. In the fanfily
traditional cultural patterns confer (~z~,) leadership on one or both of the parents. In other
cases, such as friendship groups, one or more persons may gradually emerge as leaders,
although there is no formal process of selection. In larger groups, leaders are usually chosen
formally through election or recruitment.
Although leaders are often thought to be people with unusual personal ability, decades of
research have failed to produce consistent evidence that there is any category of ""natural
leaders."" It seems that there is no set of personal qualities that all leaders have in common;
rather, virtually any person may be recognized as a leader if the person has qualities that meet
the needs of that particular group.
Furthermore, although it is commonly supposed that social groups have a single leader,
research suggests that there are typically two different leadership roles that are held by
different individuals. Instrumental leadership is leadership that emphasizes the completion of
tasks by a social group. Group members look to instrumental leaders to ""get things done.""
Expressive leadership, on the other hand, is leadership that emphasizes the collective
well-beings of a social group's members. Expressive leaders are less concerned with the
overall goals of the group than with providing emotional support to group members and
attempting to minimize tension and conflict among them. Group members expect expressive
leaders to maintain stable relationships within the group and provide support to individual
members.
Instrumental leaders are likely to have a rather  _ to other group
members. They give orders and may discipline group members who prohibit attainment  
of the group's goals. Expressive leaders cultivate a more personal or primary relationship to
others in the group. They offer sympathy when someone experiences difficulties or is
subjected to discipline, are quick to lighten a serious moment with humor, and try to resolve
issues that threaten to divide the group. As the difference in these two roles suggests,
expressive leaders generally receive more personal affection from group members;
instrumental leaders, if they are successful in promoting group goals, may enjoy a more
distant respect.",high21799.txt
