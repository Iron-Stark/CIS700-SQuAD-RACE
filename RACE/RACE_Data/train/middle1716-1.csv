1,C,"['grey sky', 'dark clouds', 'strong winds', 'cold rain']","In the autumn of England, we can NOT often see   _  .","Have you ever seen snow? Many people in the world have not. Some countries never have snow; some have only a little on the tops of very high mountains. In the north of England, there is quite a lot of snow every winter, but in the south of England, there is usually little.

The light of his room comes from clean, beautiful snow.",middle1716.txt
