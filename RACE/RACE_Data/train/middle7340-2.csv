2,B,"['silly and dishonest', 'wise and friendly', 'helpful but nervous', 'modest but impatient']","From the passage, we can tell that the taxi driver is   _  .","One day I got in a taxi, and we left for the airport. We were driving in the right lane   when, suddenly, a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us. My taxi driver stopped his car at once. The tire   made a very loud noise, and at the very last moment our car stopped just one inch from the black of the other car.
I was _ . But then I couldn't believe what happened next. The driver of the other car, the guy who almost caused a big accident, turned his head and started yelling  at us. I couldn't believe it! But my taxi driver just smiled at the guy. So I asked, ""Why did you just do that? This guy almost sent us to hospital. ""
This is when my taxi driver taught me what I now call ""The Law of the Rubbish Truck   . "" He explained that many people are like rubbish trucks. They run around full of rubbish, full of anger and full of bad feelings. As their rubbish piles up, they look for a place to throw it away and sometimes they'll throw it at you. Don't take it personally. Just smile, wish them well, and move on. Don't take their rubbish and spread it to other people at work, at home or on the streets.
Successful people never let rubbish trucks change their moods  . Life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets, so love those who love you and pray  for those who don't.",middle7340.txt
