Joyce interviewed some young people. Here are their opinions:
Harold: I don't quite understand why they are so mad about the childish game. Maybe they are just not confident enough to face the real world.
Allan: I enjoy putting some ""bugs"" in my friends' gardens and we've become closer because of the game. Having fun together is the most exciting thing about it.
