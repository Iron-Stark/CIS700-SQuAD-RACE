1,C,"['US Congress to Update Privacy Policies for 21st Century', 'Common Sense Media Warns Against Social Networks', 'US Parents Want Better Online Privacy Protection for Kids', 'Worry Grows for Problems Caused by Social Networks']",Which of the following may be the best title for the passage?,"When it comes to protecting the privacy of their children, U.S. parents give social networks a failing grade. According to a recent survey, three out of four parents believe social networks are not doing a good job of protecting kids' online privacy. 
The survey was conducted for Common Sense Media, a nonprofit organization devoted to helping families find the right way to deal with the world of media and technology.
Ninety-two percent of parents said they are concerned that children share too much information online, and 85 percent said they are more concerned about online privacy than they were five years ago. In other findings, Common Sense Media found that 68% of parents are not at all confident in search engines keeping their private information safe and secure and 71% of parents said the same about social networking sites.
The survey found a great deal of concern about the online geo-location services which find and show the exact position of somebody through the net. Ninety-one percent of parents said search engines and social networking sites should not be able to share the physical location of children with other companies unless the parents approve.
""The survey results present a clear divide between the industry's view of privacy and the opinion of parents and kids,"" Common Sense Media CEO and founder James Steyer said.
""American families are deeply worried about how their personal information is being used by technology and online companies, yet the companies appear to be keeping their heads deep in the sand,"" Steyer said.
IT companies need to step up but parents, children, schools and government also need to do more, he said.
""Parents and kids have to educate themselves about how to protect their information,"" he said. ""Schools should teach all students and their parents about privacy protection.""
""And finally, policymakers have to update privacy policies for the 21st century,"" he said. According to the survey, more than 60 percent of parents want the US Congress to update online privacy laws for children and teenagers.",high20345.txt
