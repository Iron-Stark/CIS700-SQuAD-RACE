Whether to cheat depends on whether it's in the person's interest."" He does, however, see less cheating among the youngest students. Richard Dienstbier, psychology professor at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, believes that society's attitudes explain much of the increase in cheating. ""Twenty years ago if a person cheated in college, that is extremely serious, he will be dropped for a semester if not kicked out permanently,"" he says.
