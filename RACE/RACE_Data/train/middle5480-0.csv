The college entrance examination is one of the most important tests in our lives. Now, the big exam has got a big change.

Students also have to learn six other subject - physics, chemistry, biology, geography, politics and history. They will have a final test after finishing their studies in each subject. They can choose three to hand in when applying for  universities.
Nowadays, liberal arts  and science  have different tests. For example, in some places, liberal arts students get easier math questions. Under the new system, everyone will have same tests.

""Two opportunities help the students show their real level better. As a result, we will pa y more attention to helping students be interested in the language instead of just teaching them the skills of dealing with tests. We will give them more chances to use the language, such as reading English.""",middle5480.txt
