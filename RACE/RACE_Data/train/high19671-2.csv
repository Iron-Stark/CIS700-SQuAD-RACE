2,C,"['In Fukushima, more than 10,000 families still cannot return home.', 'The disaster forced Japan to close most of its nuclear power plants.', 'Japanese authorities were forced to do more after the disaster.', 'Chikara Yoshida and his daughter posted a petition on the Associated Press.']",Which of the following statements is true?,"Five years after a deadly earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, recovery remains years away.
More than 16,000 people died in the disaster and more than 470,000 were removed from their homes, says the Japanese Red Cross Society. Over 2,500 people are still missing and predicted dead. After pressure from survivors, the Japanese Coast Guard began underwater searches for the missing.
In Fukushima, more than 100,000 families still cannot return home, says the Red Cross Society. This is because of radioactive pollution from the damaged Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.
In Japan, the disaster is known as ""3-1-1"" , marking the date five years ago.
It was really three disasters rolled into one.
""It started with an earthquake devastating   in itself, then the tsunami, and then the radiation from the nuclear plant,"" said Shioko Goto, a Japan expert at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C..Goto said the disaster showed the world, ""Japanese resilience   and Japanese unity.""
But it also showed shortcomings. Among the most notable, the long time it took to stabilize the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant after it was flooded from the tsunami, Goto said. That process took eight months. Another, Japan's dependence on nuclear power, she said. The disaster forced Japan to close all of its nuclear power plants, leaving parts of the country without electricity.
Goto offered up one major difference from the last major Japanese disaster, the 1995 Kobe Earthquake. In 2011, social media was everywhere, she said. Social media offered up plenty of ""unfounded rumors and fear-mongering  ,"" Goto said.
But it also kept pressure on Japanese authorities to do more. Chikara Yoshida lost his only son, a 43-year-old volunteer fireman, on March 11, 2011. He and his daughter posted a petition   on Facebook to restart underwater searches. It drew over 28,000 signatures, according to the Associated Press.
The Japanese Coast Guard announced that it would resume searches this week. There have also been complaints that reconstruction efforts in hard-hit northern Japanese communities have been too slow. This week, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the government will respond.",high19671.txt
