0,C,"['EI has something to do with telling truths and 1ies.', 'The participants were asked to identify liars on the spot.', 'The participants had to tell reasons for their judgments.', 'Those confident participants all made wrong judgments.']",Which of the following is true about the study and its findings?,"Science Daily (May 1S, 2012) - People who rate themselves as having high emotional    intelligence (El) tend to overestimate   their ability to detect deception  in others.      This is the finding of a paper published in the journal Legal and Criminological Psychology on 18 May 2012.
Professor Stephen Porter. director of the Centre for the Advancement of Psychological     Science and Law at University of British Columbia Canada along with colleagues Dr. Leanne Brinke and Alysha Baker used a standard questionnaire to measure the EI of 116 participants.
These participants were then asked to view 20 videos from around the world of people     pleading   for the safe return of a missing family member. In half the videos the person     making the plea was responsible for the missing person's disappearance or murder.
The participants were asked to judge whether the pleas were honest or deceptive say how much confidence they had in their judgments, report the clues   they had used to make those judgments and rate their emotional response to each plea.
Professor Porter found that higher EI was associated with overconfidence in assessing the sincerity of the pleas and sympathetic feelings towards people in the videos who turned out to be responsible for the disappearance.
Although EI, in general, was not associated with being better or worse at telling the difference between truths and lies. people with a higher ability to notice and express emotion (a component of EI) were not so good at spotting when people were telling lies.
Professor Porter says: ""Taken together, these findings suggest findings features of emotional     intelligence and the decision-making processes _ lead to may nave the paradoxical   effect of weakening people's ability to detect deception.""
""These findings are important because El is a well-accepted concept and is used in a variety of fields, including the workplace""",high5149.txt
