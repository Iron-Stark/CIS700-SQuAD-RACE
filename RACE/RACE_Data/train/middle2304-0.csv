0,C,"['She watches TV', 'She does the chores', 'She begins talking', 'She goes to bed early']",What does Mrs Smith often do after supper?,"Mr. Smith works in an office. He is very busy and has no time to have a good rest. Every evening, when he comes from his office, he's always tired and wants to go to bed early. But his wife often has a lot of interesting things to tell him after supper. She doesn't stop talking until she falls asleep, but it's usually too late and Mr Smith has to get up in time in the morning when she is asleep.
One day the man felt terrible and couldn't go to work. He decided to go to see a doctor. And Mrs Smith went to the hospital with him. Before her husband said what was the matter with him, the woman told the doctor all and the man understood why. He wrote out a prescription. And when Mr Smith brought the medicine to the resulting-room, the doctor said to her, ""The bottle of medicine is for your husband and the pills are for you.""
""For me?"" the woman said in surprise, ""I'm fine. I don't need any medicine!"" ""I don't think so, madam,"" said the doctor, ""They are sleeping pills, your husband will soon be all right if you take them.""",middle2304.txt
