1,C,"['the couple has three children in all', 'the album was all the photos of the girl', ""the girl heard her parents'love story many times"", ""the girl's mother got married in December after graduating""]",We can learn from the passage that   _  .,"I was never tired of heating their story.As a little girl,I'd sit beside my mom with their
wedding album spread across my lap,slowly turning the pages of 8 x l 0 glossy black and white
photographs.I'd trace my fingers along their faces,along that white wedding dress.
""Tell me again,""I said . ""Tell me again about you and dad.""
And she'd smile and her eyes would crinkle and she'd get that loving look and then she'd
repeat once more Their Love Story.
    I'd smile too and stare at that photo of my non looking SO beautiful and my dad so tall and
handsome.
""Your dad was tall and really good--looking as he stood by his classroom door greeting his
students.Besides coaching,he taught history and social studies.I often stole a few looks since my
classes were nearby.That year I had many conversations with ' Mr.Kehoe',sometimes when he
had lunch duty,sometimes when I had cheerleading practice.He was appointed cheerleader sponsor
and I'd been a cheerleader for four years.
We were married that November during the Thanksgiving holiday.1 went from a graduate one
year to a teacher's wife the next!
But part of the story that I loved most,that all my life I thought was magical and wonderful and
amazing and exciting and oh--so romantic.
   So,what do you think ?Did God speak to me?""
I'd catch and hold my breath,then exclaim,""Oh,yes !God told you that you'd marry Dad!""
Now can you see why I loved heating Their Love Story ?And SO their wedding.Then their
marriage.Then their family.Three babies in three years,then a fourth. Then,what else would you
expect after heating the Voice of God--years and years and years of Happy Moments!
Now it's come to this:60 years of marriage !",high17998.txt
