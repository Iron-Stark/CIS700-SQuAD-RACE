       Experts say there are three types of e-mails with different rules--close friends, office and public e-mails.The close friends e- mail

       Don't add to people's workload. Keep e-mails short and to the point.
       *Make the subject line factual and brief.
       *Write in clear, concise sentences.
       *Provide your name and phone number at the end.The Public e-mail
       Occasionally we have to send an e-mail to a group of people. If possible, write your public e-mails with a who, what, when, where structure. For example:
       Who:All members of the soccer team
       What:Team photo
       When:Saturday, March 25, at noon
       Where:Playing field 2.
       Finally, before you hit""Send"", check the following.
       *Is the e-mail a""flame""? Never send an e-mail in anger. It could stay around forever and haunt your professional and personal life.
       *Check the ""To""field. Is this really who you want to send the message to?
       *Spell-check the message. Does it have an error that can affect you badly?",high22895.txt
