2,A,"['he had his personal charm', 'he liked being a cowboy', 'he was not a true policeman', 'a bullwhip was more useful']",Chang Apana didn't need a gun as a weapon because  _  .,"The fictional Chinese-American detective Charlie Chan was the subject of popular books and movies for many decades. In recent years, however, the character has been criticized as an ill image of Asian-Americans.
Yunte Huang, an English professor at the University of California, says that's not the case. He has been exploring the character and real-life policeman who inspired him.
Charlie Chan has been a familiar character to readers and film-goers, beginning in the 1920s. The detective solved crimes around the world in more than 40 films through the 1940s, and with the invention of television, found a new audience in the 1950s and 1960s.
Huang discovered Charlie Chan through books by American author Earl Derr Biggers, who created the character.
""One day, I happened to find two Charlie Chan novels. At that point I thought I knew that he was a negative character against Asians, but when I read the book,"" he says, ""I was immediately attracted. Ever since then, I've been a fan of Charlie Chan.""
As a fan of the books and films, Huang was surprised to learn that Charlie Chan was based on a real detective named Chang Apana, who was born to Chinese parents in Hawaii around 1871. Apana worked as a cowboy, and joined the Honolulu police force in 1898.
""He almost immediately became a local legend because as a former cowboy,"" says Huang, ""he would walk the most dangerous areas in Chinatown carrying a bullwhip instead of a gun. He didn't need that.""
Although some say the image of Charlie Chan, with his broken English, is embarrassing for Asian-Americans, Huang believes Chan's broken English and unusual ancient sayings were part of his charm .
""Let me just quote a few - 'Actions speak louder than French,' or 'Mind like parachute  . Only function when open.' Charlie Chan always owes these instructive sayings to Confucius' eastern wisdom.
For Huang, the fictional Charlie Chan is highly entertaining, while the real-life policeman, Chang Apana, is a Chinese-American success, whose story is worth telling.",high959.txt
