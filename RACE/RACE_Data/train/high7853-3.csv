3,D,"['To show the importance of self-defense training.', 'To warn teenagers of possible dangers on the way to school.', 'To show how brave she was while she was being attacked at that time.', 'To share her experience and tell us that we are perhaps not as weak as we thought we were.']",What might be the author's purpose of writing this passage?,"One day I was walking home along the street with my iPod on, when suddenly my headphones  were knocked off my head and a man threw his arm around my neck, saying ""Just be quiet."" I was being attacked, and this man's arm was gripping   onto me! I started screaming and tried to pull him off me, but failed. He was forcing me to walk towards the back of an auto repair shop and he just kept saying: ""Be quiet.""
My mind froze with fear. Then I heard my great-grandmother's voice in my head. She was saying: ""Come on now, I know you are stronger than that!"" She was the rock in our family until she died four years ago.
I have never had any self-defense  training, but I went for it--I let out a loud scream as I kicked my leg back into his shin ! He let go of me and I ran off. When I looked back to see if he was running after me, I saw he was running in the opposite direction. Then I ran like crazy to a nearby drugstore.
I asked the girl at the counter for the phone and called my mom. She picked me up five minutes later and I explained what happened through sobs. ""I am calling the police!"" She exclaimed. When we got home, two officers were waiting for us and I told them what had happened.
After my experience, I was afraid to do anything. Things slowly got better, but I still don't like anyone going near my neck.
The fear isn't totally gone--after all, the guy is still out there somewhere. But I had a new understanding of my own strength. I never expected to be able to fight off an attacker. I am stronger than I realized.",high7853.txt
