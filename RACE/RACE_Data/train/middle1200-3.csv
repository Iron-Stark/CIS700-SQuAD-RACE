3,A,"['After class.', 'In class.', 'Before class.', 'After school']",When can the students go to the library?,"My school is not big but beautiful. There is a garden in the school. There are
many flowers in the garden.  The flowers are colorful-they are all kinds of colours. In the center  of the garden, there is a pool. The fish are swimming in it. They look very happy and free.
There are two teaching buildings around the garden. There are 18 classrooms in it. And there are also many other rooms in it -- music room, reading room, language lab and library.  There are all kinds of books in the library, such as storybooks, cartoon books and magazines. You can read them after class.
The playground is behind the teaching building. We do morning exercises on the playground every day.  On the playground, you can play sports--running, playing basketball and playing badminton.
I like my school very much.",middle1200.txt
