       Marat had picked up his racket   almost as soon as he could walk and at five was hitting balls with a little child until 1992.
       When Marat was 13, his parents decided to send him abroad for further practice, so in that year Marat and his mother visited a tennis school inValenciawhere Maria Pasqual, former director of Spanish women's tennis, was asked to judge his potential. Pasqual liked what she saw and managed to persuade a Swiss client into keeping him at the school.
In the following four years Marat lived in Valenciaemploying Pasqual as his career advisor, working on his great clay court skills and learning the Spanish language.
Marat's first title came in 1997 at a Challenger in Espinho and soon afterwards he turned professional. He won his first title on the ATP Tour in August, 1999 when he beat Greg Rusedski in the final of the MFS Professional Championships in Boston. In 2000, Safin won his first Grand Slam   title--US Open. He also reached the final of the Australian Open in 2002 and 2004. On November 7, 2004, Marat Safin beat Czech qualifier' Stepanek to win his third Paris Masters title. He also won the Paris Masters in 2000 and 2002.
""I really enjoy tennis because it brings about extreme emotions and allows me to live my dreams,"" said Safin. Yes, the future certainly looks rosy for him. Just like what his former adviser, Maria Pasqual said, ""He will be a champion one day"" -- surely he already is!",high18822.txt
