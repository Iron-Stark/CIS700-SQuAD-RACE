0,A,"['within an inch of life', 'on the way to success', 'left aside by her family', 'in a good state']","According to Fox News, Bobbi Kristina is   _  .","Bobbi Kristina Brown's family has been gathered around her since she was hospitalized on Saturday after being found unconscious in the bathtub of her suburban Atlanta townhome.
Whitney Houston's only child is now at Emory University Hospital and is still fighting for her life, as a family statement said on Monday.
Nothing has changed, despite reports that are popping up and painting a more serious picture.
Fox News reported Wednesday that the situation is horrific. ""It's now a matter of when the family wants to let go and accept that she's pretty much not going to make it,"" a source told FOX411. ""They've left it up to the family as to how long they want to keep her alive.""
People Magazine is also reporting that a doctor told Brown's family on Wednesday that nothing more could be done. ""Everyone is coming to the hospital to say goodbye,"" said a family member.
And the Daily Mail says Brown has been taken off life support.
But Bobby Brown issued a statement late Thursday denying these reports.
""If we issued a statement every time the media published a false report regarding this matter, that's all we would be doing 24 hours a day. This is false, just as is the vast majority of the other reporting that is currently taking place,"" he said, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.
A source close to the family tells USA TODAY that it's wrong to say the family is gathering to say goodbye, because the family has been there since the beginning, so nothing is any different today for them.
Also, Brown is ""not brain dead,"" as has been reported.
And, as for other stories saying that the Houston family is feuding with Bobbi Kristina's dad, Bobby Brown? Those aren't true either. They ""are NOT fighting,"" says our source.",high9977.txt
