0,C,"['To improve school education.', 'To share achievements of technologies.', ""To develop children's creativity."", 'To predict some unexpected situations.']",What does the project of Unexpect aim to do?,"On November 15th, 2014, children aged 8 to 12 got together in five cities around the world to participate in the first Global Children's Designation. The event that was organized by a Dutch company called Unexpect, challenged kids to come up with solutions for some of the world's most pressing problems in a day!
The day began with the kids listening to the various challenges that were related to their particular cities and towns. The teams were then asked to brainstorm about which problem they were going to handle and how. There were so many amazing ideas produced on that day.
While some of the ideas were far from perfect, there were many that could be practical like the smart cars which can ease traffic pressure by telling traffic lights of its arrival and also guiding the drivers to the best possible route .
Emer Beamer, the founder of Unexpect, says the purpose of the project is to introduce children to skills they probably never learn in class. She says that for most part, schools focus on teaching things that they will most likely never need to know again. She believes that for kids to be successful in the world, they should be learning how to be creative, handle new technologies and deal with unexpected situations.
Though the first global design challenge was relatively small, involving only a few hundred of the two billion youngsters that are bursting with ideas, the next one will be much bigger. That's because in 2015, Unexpect plans to distribute free tool kits  to any school that is interested in hosting their own Children's Designation Challenge. We can't wait to see what ideas kids will come up with next.",high12967.txt
