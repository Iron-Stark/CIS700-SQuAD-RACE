0,C,"['fatter', 'thinner', 'healthier', 'Cleverer']",Early rising people are  _  than late rising people.,"Some people like to get up early, but some do not. In fact, it is really good for us to get up early every day. Maybe those who don't like getting up early will not believe this, but it is true. Scientists made a survey in about one thousand people, and then they found that early rising  people had less disease  than late rising people, and early rising people also look healthier than late rising people, and so on.
So we may know early rising is helpful in more than one way. First, it helps to keep us healthy. We all need fresh  air. But air is never so fresh as early in the morning. Besides, it is useful to do morning exercises.
Secondly, early rising helps us in our studies. In the morning we learn more quickly and find it easier to understand what we learn.
Thirdly, early rising can give us a plan of our work for the day. We cannot work well without a good plan.
Fourthly; early rising gives us enough time to get ready for our work, such as to wash our hands and faces and eat our breakfast.
Late risers may find it difficult to form the habit  of early rising. They have to make an effort  to do so. As the English proverb says, ""Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy  and wise. """,middle521.txt
