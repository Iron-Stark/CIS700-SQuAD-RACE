2,D,"['Leadership Is of Skills and Techniques', 'Leadership Is Very Important', 'Not Many Can Be Leaders', 'How to Be a Leader']",Which of the following can be the best title for the passage?,"Being considered a leader in our society is indeed of high praise.Leadership means power,
commands respect and, most important, encourages achievement.Unlike vitamin C, leadership
skills can't be easily swallowed down.They must be carefully cultivated.
       Different from popular belief, most good leaders are made, not born.They learn their skills in their everyday lives.But which do they develop? How do they (and how can you) get others to follow?
       Always give credit.Many leaders note that the most efficient way to get a good performance
from others is to treat them like heroes.Giving public credit to someone who has earned it is the best leadership technique in the world.It is also an act of generosity   that's never forgotten.
Giving credit is more effective than even the most constructive criticism   , which often
hurts rather than helps.Kenneth Blanchard, the author of The One-Minute Manager, agrees.
""Catch people doing something right!"" he says.Then tell everyone about it.
       Take informed risks."" The best leaders know that taking a risk is not a thoughtless exercise,""
says management adviser Marilyn Machlowitz.""Sky divers don't go up in an airplane without checking the parachutes   beforehand.""
       Because the idea of risk also carries with it the possibility of failure, many of us usually wait
for others to take charge.But if you want to be a leader, you must learn to fail - and not die a
thousand deaths.Pick yourself up and start all over again.
       Encourage enthusiasm  .""When people understand the importance of work, they lend
their mental strengths,"" says Lee Ducat.But when they get excited about the work, all their energy gets poured into the job.That's a great force! Is this the best way to create excitement? Be 
enthusiastic your-self - You will be followed by everyone.",high21675.txt
