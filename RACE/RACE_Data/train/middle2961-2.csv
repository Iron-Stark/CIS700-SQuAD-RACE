2,A,"['the girl seemed to understand what her father said', ""the girl wasn't interested in the explanation"", 'the father was good at raising snakes', 'the father liked the snake skin better']",We learn from the reading that  _  .,"Sarah ran in, shouting, ""Look what I found!""  Over the top of the paper I was reading; came a terrible thing that caused me to jump. It was a snake skin found in our garden.
""Isn't it beautiful?"" said my seven-year-old daughter.
I opened my eyes widely and looked at the snake skin in fear . I didn't think it was beautiful, but I learned never to appear nonchalant with children. Everything they see for the first time is important to their sense of beauty; they see only excellence in the world.
""Why does it do this?""  Sarah asked.
""Snakes shed  their skins because they need to renew themselves,""  I explained.
""Why do they need to renew  themselves?"" Sarah asked.
""We often need to shed our skins, those coatings that we cover ourselves with,"" I said to my daughter. ""We leave some things and find other thing unwanted or unnecessary. This snake no longer needs this skin. It is probably too little for him, and he probably doesn't think he looks as smart in it as he once did. ""
As we talked, I knew that she began to understand. Although she couldn't understand clearly, she would know that renewal is part of progress; that we need to take a good look at ourselves, our rooms, schoolwork and spirit, and see what we need to keep and what we need to leave.  I was careful to tell that this is a natural way, not one to be forced.
""Snakes don't peel off their skins when they like them. ""I explained. ""It happens as a natural thing of their growth. ""
""I see, Dad,"" said Sarah as she held the snake skin, and then ran off.
I hoped she would remember this; we need to throw some away because they are worthless or unnecessary. Then we can store them as memories in our deep hearts.",middle2961.txt
