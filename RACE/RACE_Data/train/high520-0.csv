0,B,"['Homeless and sick children', 'Less fortunate members of our society', 'Hungry people who have no beds to sleep in', 'Friendly members of our society to help others']",What kind of people are these organizations designed for?,"This is a time of year when we think about giving and receiving presents. Can you find a little extra to give? On this page we suggest a few organizations you might like to help.
Littleton Children's Home
We DON'T want your money, but children's toys, books and clothes IN GOOD CONDITION would be very welcome.
Also, we are looking for friendly families who would take our children into their homes for a few hours or days as guests. You have so much-will you share it?
Phone Sister Thomas on 55671
Children's Hospice
We look after a small number of very sick children. This important work needs skill and love. We cannot continue without gifts or money to pay for more nursing staff. We also need storybooks and toys suitable for quiet games.
Please contact the Secretary, Little Children's Hospice, Newby Road.
Street Food
In the winter weather, it's no fun being homeless. It's even worse if you're hungry. We give hot food to at least fifty people every night. It's hard work, but necessary. Can you come and help? If not, can you offer a little money? We use a very old kitchen, and we need some new saucepans . Money for new ones would be most welcome indeed.
Contact Street Food, c/o Mary's House, Elming Way. Littleton Phone 27713
Littleton Youth Club
Have you got an unwanted chair? - a record-player? - a pot of paint ? Because we can use them!
We want to get to work on our meeting room!
Please phone 66231 and we'll be happy to collect anything you can give us.
Thank you!
The Night Shelter
We offer a warm bed for the night to anyone who has nowhere to go. We rent the former Commercial Hotel on Green Street. Although it is not expensive, we never seem to have quite enough money. Can you let us have a few pounds? Any amount, however small, will be such a help.
Send it to us at 15, Green St, Littleton. Please make check payable to Night Shelter.",high520.txt
