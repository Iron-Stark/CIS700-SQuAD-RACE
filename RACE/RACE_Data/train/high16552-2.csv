The six-year-old child suddenly said he was so lucky because he had so many toys to play with at home.
His surprised parents replied that he was lucky, since a lot of kids didn't have any toys at all. ""How can that be?"" John said, confused, but then he said that he would like to get toys for those children. His parents naturally thought their son was just kidding. But as soon as they returned home, John began using his pocket money to buy toys for other kids and asking his friends to do the same. His parents responded by organizing pizza suppers for other families interested in helping other children that can't afford to buy toys. John thought that he just wanted to cheer those kids up.
John's parents started to find a place that would allow children as young as six and seven to volunteer. They finally find a day care center for disabled children to let John and his friends visit. They went and played with these kids, playing around the room as if they belonged there.
John and his friends named their work Kids Cheering Kids. John and his friends visited kids at some childcare centers, helping out with a party they organized. They also prepared a performance for children with disabilities. Their activities have drawn public concern.
The spirit of helping is as fresh as it was that day in Hawaii. ""The whole purpose,""
John says, ""is to make the kids feel better.""",high16552.txt
