2,C,"['paid no attention to teaching', 'had no time to read books', ""didn't care about what he did"", 'showed no respect to students']","In the opinion of Alvarez, most teachers   _  .","Roger Alvarez, 22, was one of the 52 percent of students who didn't make it through his senior year at Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles.
He dropped out several years ago, but by the time he was in ninth grade, Alvarez says he already knew he wasn't going to graduate.
""There's a certain amount of knowledge you have to have when you enter in a specific grade, and I didn't have it."" Alvarez says,""Every class I used to go in, I was like, 'Do I know this? I don't know this.'""
It was a shameful attitude, he tells his former English teacher, Antero Garcia, 29.
""You were determined to help me, but what was I willing to give? I could have actually tried.""
For his part, Garcia wants to know how he could have reached out to Alvarez better, but Alvarez says Garcia had always been helpful.
""I mean, you could cheer me up, and then I see other students doing way better,"" Alvarez says,""So then, I get nervous. I get stuck, and then _ ."" He felt the situation was hopeless.
""You talked to me like if I could do it, but inside me, I knew I couldn't."" he tells Garcia,""I just didn't want you to think that I'm...stupid.""
Now, school is a life tool that Alvarez says he's missing--but his teacher isn't to blame.
""Always, I just wanted you to know...you were a good teacher, and I always respected you."" he tells Garcia,""Some teachers, I felt like they only wanted to teach a certain group of people. But you looked at me and you paid attention.""
""Maybe it didn't get me to graduate, but there're a lot of teachers, they don't take the time to take a look. And it was never your fault.""
Alvarez now works the night shift at a loading dock . He still hopes to get his degree one day.",high4843.txt
