0,C,"['Children', 'Adults', 'Both A and B', 'Nobody']",Who loves to see the latest cartoon movie Zootopia?,"The latest colorful 3D cartoon movie, Zootopia, has become a great success. It has not only won the hearts of children but also drawn the attention of adults.
The film tells about a rabbit called Judy who was born in carrot farmers. All her life, she's dreamed of being a police officer and finally leaves for Zootopia, a beautiful modern city, to go for her dream. It's a place where, according to her understanding, ""anyone can be anything.""
At first, she is put on parking duty, because nobody believes a rabbit can become a great policewoman compared to other big and strong predator animals .While on duty, she gets to know a sly-looking fox, Nick . They once misunderstand each other and have words with each other. But they work together to solve a secret _ successfully in the end .
From the movie we also can get a clear and powerful message: prejudice , in any form, is a terrible thing. We should say no to it. Luckily, we can see both predators and prey-predators  can live in peace in Zootopia finally.
Anyway, Zootopia is a great piece of work with important life lessons: life's a little bit messy, and we all make mistakes;no matter what type of animal you are, change starts with you. So stick to your dream and work for it. You know, ""everything is possible.""",middle7222.txt
