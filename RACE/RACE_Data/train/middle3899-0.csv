0,B,"['Music.', 'Basketball.', 'Football.', 'Drawing']",What does Jumping Tiger think is cool?,"In a chatting room on the Internet, some children are talking about what they like to do at school. Flying Fish: I think music is my favourite. I like listening to many beautiful English songs. I need to feel _ after a day's work. So I often listen to my favourite music after supper.
Singing Bird: I like music, too. But I only listen to Chinese songs. I also like drawing. Maybe I can be a great painter   when I grow up. I also like reading. Reading makes me clever.
Jumping Tiger: I don't like music or drawing. They are a waste  of time, I think. I am a good basketball player. I can help our school team win. Don't you think it's cool?
Running football: I am not a good basketball player. But I play football well. Playing football makes me strong. I feel great when I am on the football field. I spend half an hour a day playing football.
Swimming Cat: I am not like many other boys. I don't like sports very much. I just think reading is my favourite. I can learn a lot from books. I spend an hour reading books every day.",middle3899.txt
