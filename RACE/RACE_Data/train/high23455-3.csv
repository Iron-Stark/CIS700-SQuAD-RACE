3,A,"[""You Can Run, but You Can't Hide"", 'New Cell phones in Need', 'The Future of Cell phones', 'Modern Technology and Personal Secret']",What would be the best title for the text?,"Japanese workers who run secretly out of the office and spend their afternoons hanging around coffee shops may soon be caught out by their bosses. A new cellphonebased tracking device from Hitachi can show, on an employer's computer screen, not only the whereabouts of their workers but also whether they are standing, walking, running--or have fallen over.
The system, called Partout, was originally developed as a monitoring device for the families of people with dementia, who may wander off and need to be located. ""It's estimated that the number of elderly people with symptoms of dementia will reach 1.5 million in Japan next year,"" says Hitachi's Keisaku Shibatani. But the high cost of the system--early prices are around PS27,000--has put it out of reach of most families. Indeed, companies with large sales forces and police departments who want to track officers on dangerous patrol duties are interested in the system.
Partout uses a multifunction location sensing unit that tracks users through global positioning satellites. The user's body motion is determined by an accelerometer inside the sensing unit: no movement means the subject has stopped, slow movement means they are walking, fast movement means they are running, and strong and unexpectedly sudden movement means the user may have fallen. The date is relayed through the user's cell phone to computer, which displays their position on a map. Graphics record the motion or position of the subject's body.",high23455.txt
