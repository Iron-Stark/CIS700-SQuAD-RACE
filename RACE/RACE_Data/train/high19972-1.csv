1,A,"[""The value of the stolen jewellery hasn't been worked out yet."", 'The woman working next to the store fought the robbers bravely.', 'The policemen have already caught 2 0r 3 robbers.', ""Not all of the store's workers were injured in the attack.""]",Which of the following statements is TRUE?,"Ram-raiders armed with hammers smashed  their way into an exclusive  jewellery store in central Sydney. The thieves used a white four-wheel drive  (4WD) to smash through the back window of the Mondial Neuman store in the historic Queen Victoria Building just before 9 a.m. on January 19.
Detective Sergeant Paul Dunstan said three or four people were believed to have been in the 4WD. He said two or three people armed with what were thought to be hammers entered the shop through the smashed window, which fronts York St, before taking jewellery and driving away in a red Audi car. It's too early to say how much was taken, police said, but luckily, none of the store's workers was injured in the attack.
A woman was working next door to the jewellery store. She saw the drama unfold and called the police.
""I was just going to go upstairs when I saw the car stop,"" she said,  ""It mounted the kerb   and  at first Ijust thought it was a bad driver. Then I saw a person who was masked  jump out of the back seat and move a cafe table out of the way.The truck just rammed into the window.""
She said the man then went back to the car and got a bag out of the back seat before going into the store.  ""I was shaking. I was scared they would see me. I heard screaming from the next door,"" she said,  ""you know, this is the second time in several months the store has been robbed."" A police spokesman said detectives were still talking to witnesses and the owners of the store.",high19972.txt
