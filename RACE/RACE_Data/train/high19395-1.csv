1,C,"['The first MERS patient was found in America.', 'The patient in Orlando was infected when he was taking a plane.', 'Most MERS cases occurred in the Middle East.', ""One problem about MERS is that we don't know which subject it belongs to.""]",Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?,"MERS, also known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, has made its way to the US. The second patient was in Orlando, Florida while the first reported case was in Indiana.
Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the disease has mainly been transmitted  by close personal contact, such as directly caring for a very ill person.
The virus is formally called MERS-CoV because it's part of the corona virus  family that includes the common cold and severe SARS. SARS was  ly easy to stop a decade ago, because it was being transmitted by caged animals in Chinese markets. MERS-CoV was first identified in people in 2012, but has been spreading rapidly since March, 2015. The vast majority of those cases occurred in Saudi Arabia.
The patient in Orlando felt ill on the first flight but not ill enough to notify a doctor. Early on May 9, he apparently became concerned that he was still feeling ill, and he went to the emergency room at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital. He identified himself as recently having been in Saudi Arabia, so he was quickly isolated to avoid infecting  other patients.
Wayne Marasco, an expert at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, said his biggest concern about MERS-CoV is how little we know about it. It's still not clear, in some instances, where the virus comes from, how it is transmitted or who is most subject.",high19395.txt
