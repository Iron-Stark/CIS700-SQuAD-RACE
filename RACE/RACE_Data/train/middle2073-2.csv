Now let me tell you something about my new house. My new house is on a busy street. There is a big, new and clean park across from my house. I can see the flowers in it from my room. We often take a walk in the park after dinner every evening. There is a big supermarket near my house. It is between a hospital and a cinema. We can buy fruits, vegetables and food in the supermarket. They are good but cheap. My school is near my house. So I always go to school on foot. I like my new house. Do you like it?",middle2073.txt
