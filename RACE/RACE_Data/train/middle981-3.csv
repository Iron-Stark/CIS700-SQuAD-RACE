3,C,"['The beautiful parks', 'The new things', 'The sand, the sea and the sun', 'The people near the sea']",_   make children like the seaside so much?,"When July comes, children know they'll have the final exams and the school year will end soon. Boys and girls will have a nearly two months' holiday, and they'll leave school by train or by car to return home to see their fathers and mothers.
The summer holiday is the best time of the year for most students. The weather is good, so they can spend most of their time playing outside .If one lives in the country, he can go on a trip into the woods or in the fields. If one lives in a big city, he can go to a park to play.
The best place for a summer holiday is the seaside. Some children are lucky enough to live near the sea. But for the others who do not, if they have the chance to stay at one of the big seaside towns for a week or two, they will talk about it all the following school year.
Now, what makes children like the seaside so much? I think it is the sand, the sea and the sun, not anything else. Of course, there are lots of new things to see, nice things to eat and interesting things to do. But the feeling of the sand under their feet, the salt water on their skin, and the warm sun on their backs make them happier.",middle981.txt
