2,A,"['This is what I was born to do', 'Golden Apple Awards', 'Spanish classes with fun', 'How to get along with kids']",What would be the best title for the passage?,"Wendy Gallegos writes ""concer"" on the board. One of her students raises her hand.
""Ms. Gallegos, you should have written 'conocer' instead,"" she said, referring to the Spanish verb for ""to know.""
Gallegos looks at the board, smiles and quickly erases her mistake.
""You see, I have taught you so well, you pick up on my mistakes,"" she said with a laugh.
To Gallegos, the scene in her classroom is typical of the children she teaches. Gallegos teaches high school Spanish. She became part of their lives and families for three years. She is willing to help her children succeed. After a couple of years, Gallegos' class becomes like home. Gallegos' Spanish class is taught mostly in English in sixth grade. By the time the students are eighth-graders, they are speaking fewer words of English and more of Spanish during the 50-minute classes.
""My goal is to get my kids to say something in Spanish every day,"" she said, ""I want them to be able to talk to me. That's why I help them, I praise them, I recognize them when they do good work. And we have fun. _ .''
If a student needs help, Gallegos offers the student a ""lifesaver,"" which is help from a classmate. The lifesaver gets a piece of candy as a reward. As the students said: ""Gallegos' class is anything but boring."" It is because of Gallegos' efforts and determination that she is the teacher who they think is most deserving of one of Collier County's Golden Apple Awards.
""I don't teach a subject, I teach kids. This is what I was born to do,"" Gallegos said.",high2010.txt
