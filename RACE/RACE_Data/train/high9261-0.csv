And I learned it in the back of a New York City taxi cab. Here's what happened.
I got in a taxi, and we took off for Grand Central Station. We were driving in the right lane   when all of a sudden, a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us. My taxi driver used his brakes  , the tires made a loud noise, and at the very last moment our car stopped just one inch   from the back of the other car.
I couldn't believe it. But then I couldn't believe what happened next. The driver of the other car, the guy who almost caused a big accident, turned his head around and he started yelling bad words at us. I couldn't believe it!
And this is when my taxi driver told me what I now call: ""The Law of the Garbage Truck  ."" He said: But then here's what really blew me away. My taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy. So, I said: ""Why did you just do that? This guy could have killed us!
""Many people are like garbage trucks. They run around full of garbage, full of frustration, full of anger, and
full of disappointment. As their garbage piles up, they look for a place to dump   it. And if you let them, they'll dump it on you.""So one day when someone wants to dump on you, don't take it personally. Just smile, wave, wish them well, and move on. Believe me. You'll be happier.""
So I started thinking, how often do I let Garbage Trucks run right over me? And how often do I take their garbage and spread it to other people at work, at home, or on the street? It was then that I said: ""I don't want their garbage and I'm not going to spread it anymore.""
I began to see Garbage Trucks. I see the load people are carrying. I see them coming to dump it. And like my taxi driver, I don't take it personally. I just smile, wave, wish them well, and I move on.",high9261.txt
