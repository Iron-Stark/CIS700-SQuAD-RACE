She shared the 2015 Nobel Prize for medicine because of the new medicine for malaria . Tu started the research in the 1970s that made her find artemisinin , a kind of medicine that has saved many people's lives. It comes from Chinese traditional medicine and now is a good way to treat malaria.
When the news came that Tu was given the prize, there were cheers as well as questions. Some said that her achievement  was the result of lots of Chinese scientists working together. So it is unfair to give the prize only to Tu.
However, Tu was awarded for ""three firsts"". She was the first to bring artemisinin to her team, the first to extract  artemisinin that can stop malaria, and the first to finish the experiment.
Giving prizes to scientists with great ideas is the best way to keep national innovation .",middle6638.txt
