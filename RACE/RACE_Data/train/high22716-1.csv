1,D,"['Friendly', 'Lucky', 'Strong', 'Excellen']",What did Cindy Volges think of Malachy?,"A small-sized Pekingese with long, soft fur took the top prize at the 136thannual Westminster Kennel Club Show in New York City on Feb 14,2012. The dog has a royal name: Palacegarden Malachy . After being named Best in Show, Malachy celebrated by nestling his 11-pound body inside the trophy .
Competition for the top prize was not easy. Malachy beat more than 2,000 dogs, including a Dalmation, a German Shepherd and a Kerry blue Terrier. But to judge Cindy Bogels, Malachy was the clear winner. ""Super dog, and he had a surprising night, "" she said. 
David Fitzpatrick is Malachy's handler and coowner. He said there would be no more shows for the four-year-old dog. Malachy, he said, would most likely go home to East Brlin, Pennsylvania, to enjoy a quiet life in the country. ' He'll probably chase squirrels and will certainly have a good time. "" Fitzpatrick said. 
However, Malachy had a busy timetable on Feb,15.He made television appearances this morning and had lunch this afternoon at Sardi's a famous New York City restaurant, where he ate from a silver plate. Later, Malachy visited a businessman and TV personality, Donald Trump.
Dogs were not the only ones in the spotlight at Westminster. Young people ages 9 to 18 took part in Junior Showmanship. In this competition, judges looked carefully at the kids, not the dogs. They watched to see how well entrants  handled their animals in the ring. About 100 kids from around the country came to New York City to show off their dogs. 11-year-old Macenzie Zeitz was one of them. She traveled eight hours to New York, with her dog Pudding. "" It is really amazing, and it's also a real honor to be here."" Zeitz said. ""Pudding likes the hotel because he gets to sleep in the bed, "" added Zeitz.",high22716.txt
