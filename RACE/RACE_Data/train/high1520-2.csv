2,C,"['He also plays the piano well.', ""He's a single father with two children."", ""He believes in Shane's talent for music and will support him."", 'Not having enough money, he will ask the teachers for help']",What do we learn about Shane's father?,"Shane Thomas is a 10-year-old pianist from England. He's being called the next Mozart because of his amazing abilities.
He has only been having piano lessons for four months, and practices four hours a week, but he has already played difficult classical pieces. He was just seven when he sat down at the piano, and could play at once. He also says he never gets nervous.
When Shane was three years old, he said that he could play the piano, but nobody took him seriously. At school, he could listen to the teacher and do his work while composing   in his head. Shame remembers all the melodies ,and when he gets home he plays them on the piano, while his father records them. Shane loves playing the piano, and when he grows up he wants to be a composer.
His tutor, Richard Goffin-Lecar, says he is like Amadeus Mozart, who lived during the 18thcentury in Salzburg, Austria, and was one of the most famous composers ever. Mr. Goffin-lecar says, ""I don't teach Shane very much. I just give him directions, then sit back and watch.""
His father, a single parent with two other children, says that although he has little money, he wants to send Shane to a good music school. ""I'm a single father, but I have this gifted child. I don't have much money, but I want to give him the best teachers, and also take him into a studio to record.""",high1520.txt
