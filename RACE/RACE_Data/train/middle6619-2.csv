2,B,"['Exercise Is Interesting', 'Be Careful With Exercise', ""Let's Do Exercise"", 'Bad Exercise']",What's the best title   for the article?,"You can't look good if you are not healthy. And one way to be healthy is to do exercise.
Football, tennis, volleyball and swimming are all good for you. Muscle   exercise is also important. You can exercise at school or at home. Boys can do push-ups   and girls can do sit-ups  .
But there are some don'ts here:
First, stay away from weight lifting  . It's bad for you, because it gives too much stress   to your body and you can't grow tall if you practise often. You should exercise for about an hour a day, and three days a week. On the other days, don't exercise too much. Exercising too much is not a good idea.
Don't go running for a long time. Running for a long time makes you tired.
Don't want fastresults  . Your muscles will grow when you get older. If you want to be healthy and strong, exercise and healthy food are the best way. But don't think you can make it in one day.",middle6619.txt
