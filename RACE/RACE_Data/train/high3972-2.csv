2,C,"['Americans are hard to understand', 'Americans have values which are entirely different from their own', 'they view Americans according to the values in their own society', 'it is difficult to understand any people when you first encounter them']","Visitors sometimes find Americans behave in a strange, confusing or unbelievable way, probably because  _  .","Most Americans would have a difficult time telling you, specifically, what the values are which Americans live by. They have never given the matter any thought.
Over the years I have introduced thousands of international visitors to life in the United States. This has caused me to try to look at Americans through the eyes of foreign visitors, I am confident that the values listed in this booklet describe most (but not all )Americans, and that understanding these values can help you, the international visitor, understand Americans.
It is my belief that if foreign visitors really understand how deeply these 13 values are _ in Americans, they will then be able to understand 95% of American actions --actions which might otherwise appear ""strange,"""" confusing,"" or ""unbelievable"" when evaluated from the perspective (aspect) of the foreigner's own society and its values.
The different behaviors of a people or a culture make sense only when seen through the basic beliefs, assumptions and values of that particular group. When you encounter (meet) an action, or hear a statement in the United States which surprises you, try to see it as an expression of one or more of the values listed in this booklet.",high3972.txt
