0,C,"['the value-added data of the times', ""students' scores of standardized tests"", 'the whole development of a student', 'the feedback of students and parents']","In the opinion of Mr. Duffy, teachers should be judged by   _  .","An argument is appearing in Los Angeles over whether a newspaper should publish teachers' names 
along with an analysis of how well they do in raising their students' standardized test scores.
Some people argue that transparency  should exist at all costs, but others hold that it's unfair to 
label individual teachers using possibly flawed  statistics. Some worry that anger over the 
forthcoming Los Angeles Timesarticle will make people oppose so-called ""value added"" analysis of
teacher performance, which is the method the Times uses.
""This incident with the L.A. Times is where the advocates  for value-added are getting a bit 
ahead of themselves,"" says Douglas Harris, an education professor. "" _ 
the gun on this kind of thing.""
""Value-added data"" is the latest trend in teacher responsibility: the idea that a student's gain from the
previous year's test -- as opposed to his or her overall performance -- can be measured and tied to the 
latest teacher.
""There are too many variables  in the testing process,"" says A.J. Duffy. But he says he opposes 
using value-added data in evaluations at all, although he acknowledges it could be a useful tool to give 
teachers feedback. ""I believe in a system that emphasizes the whole student, not just standardized tests,"" 
he says.
Proponents  of value-added say that's a valid criticism, agreeing that no one should expect
that student gains on a standardized test could capture the creativity or broader enrichment that goes on in 
many teachers' classrooms. The District of Columbia which attracted argument for its decision to fire 
teachers based in part on value-added data, uses that data for 50 percent of the evaluation, relying on 
other measures such as classroom observation for the rest. ""No one is suggesting using  _ as a single
measure of performance,"" says Paige Kowalski.
Barnett Berry, a professor, is even more critical of it. Value-added data can be useful, he and others 
say, but it's important to acknowledge its limitations. It doesn't take into account, for instance, constant 
student absence and learning gains due to summer school, after-school programs, or supplemental 
teachers, such as reading specialists.",high21151.txt
