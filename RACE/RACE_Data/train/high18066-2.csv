    Spencer collected the bats,balls,gloves,helmets and masks for his mitzvah project,which is a community service project that many Jewish kids do around their bar or bat mitzvahs .A bar mitzvah is a ceremony for a boy while a bat mitzvah is intended for a girl.The ceremony means that you are old enough to take on a grown-up's responsibilities.
    Spencer got the idea for his mitzvah project alter seeing the Ugandan national team at last year's Little League World Series.Some of the Ugandan players didn't even have their own gloves.And Spencer's donations are going to a group called ""Pitch for Baseball""--a group that gives baseball equipment to kids in low-income communities around the world.
    Mollie Schwartz and Mia Schwartz also came up with a sports-related mitzvah project.The money they raised went to the Israel Sport Center for the Disabled.They raised at least $9,000-enough to pay for at least three wheelchairs made for playing basketball.
    In Massachusetts,Abigail Miller decided to collect musical instruments for her mitzvah project.The instruments Abigail collected were then donated to groups that distribute them to kids who can't afford to buy them.""I want to make sure everybody can get the chance to enjoy music like I do,""Abigail said.Abigail collected more than three-dozen instruments-wind instruments,string instruments,keyboards,even a drum set.
    Whether it's playing sports,playing music or something else,kids such as Spencer,Mollie,Mia and Abigail are using their mitzvah projects to change the woad for the better.""They learned about generosity,''said Mollie's mother,Loft Schwartz,""and the power to make things happen"".",high18066.txt
