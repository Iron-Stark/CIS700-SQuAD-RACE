3,C,"['to pay attention to what they can do', 'not to miss any final exam at school', 'not to let themselves limit their growth', 'to surround themselves with confident people']",The point of the story is to advise readers   _  .,"The professor stood before his class of 30 senior biology students, about to pass out the final exam. ""I have been honored to be your teacher this term, and I know how hard you have all worked to prepare for this test. I also know most of you are off to medical school or graduate school next fall,"" he said to them.
""I can well understand how much pressure you are under to keep your grades up, and because I know you are able to understand this material, I am prepared to offer an automatic  ""B"" to anyone who would prefer not to take the final.""
In relief a number of students jumped up to thank the professor and left the class. The professor looked at the students who remained, and offered again, ""Any other takers? This is your last chance."" One more student decided to go.
There were seven students left. The professor closed the door. Then he handed out the final exam. There were only two sentences typed on the paper: ""Congratulations, you have just received an ""A"" in this class. Keep believing in yourself.""
I never had a professor who gave a test like that. It may seem like the easy way out of grading   a lot of exams, but it's a test that any teacher in any subject could and should give. Students who don't have confidence in what they've learned are ""B"" students at best.
The same is true for students of real life. The ""A"" students are those who believe in what they're doing because they've learned from both successes and failures. They have learned life's lessons, whether from formal education or the school of hard knocks, and become better people.
Take your cue  from Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person to reach the top of Mount Qomolangma: ""It's not the mountain we conquer  , but ourselves."" Don't let the biggest limit be yourself.",high22394.txt
