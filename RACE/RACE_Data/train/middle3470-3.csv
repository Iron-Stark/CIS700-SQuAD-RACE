3,B,"['fashion show', 'radio show', 'TV play', 'talk show']",This passage may be a   _  .,"Welcome to your favorite show-""Music Land"" ! This month we are going to have some special shows on Bach, the Father of Music.
Johann Sebastian Bach was born in Germany in 1685. During his life, Bach wrote a lot of music for the church   and for his students, but he himself did not keep his own works  carefully. Luckily, his second wife saved them for him, so today we can still remember Bach through his music.
Bach married twice in his life and had 20 children. He loved his family very much. He wrote music for one of his daughters to tell her that too much coffee was bad for her health. I am now going to play a song for you from this interesting Coffee Cantata. And we will hear more about Bach after this song.",middle3470.txt
