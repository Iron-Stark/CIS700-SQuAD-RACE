* Watch where you walk 
Avoid walking along busy streets and thoroughfares  , instead choosing side streets and parks. because pollution levels can fall by a factor of 10 just by moving a few metres away from the main source of the pollution - exhaust fumes. ""
Don't walk behind smokers, and walk on the windward, side of the street where exposure to pollutants can be 50% less than on the leewardside.  
* Pavement  sense  
When you're crossing a road, stand well back from the kerb while you wait for the lights to change. Every metre really does count when you are close to traffic. As the traffic moves, the gases can disappear in just a few seconds, particularly if the wind is up, which means holding your breath during this period can make a difference, silly as that might sound. Besides, cross the road as quickly as possible. And once you're over, continue along the pavement as far away from the kerb as possible.

And sitting upstairs on a double-decker can reduce your exposure too. It's difficult to say whether travelling on an underground train is better or worse than taking the bus, but the air pollution on underground trains tends to be less toxic by weight than that found at street level.

Worse, if you fail to clean or change the mask regularly, something dangerous can form on the mask. So the air you breathe is dirtier rather than cleaner.",high22217.txt
