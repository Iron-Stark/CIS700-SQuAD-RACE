He and Amy Dolby even managed to miss each other when they sat in the same airport waiting-room in Singapore at the same time to wait for connecting flights.
Dolby,heartbroken when she arrived at Johnstone's Sydney apartment to find he had flown to London,told the Times:""It was as though someone was playing a cruel joke on us.He is the most romantic person I have ever known.I think our problem is that we are both quite impulsive people.We are always trying to surprise each other.""
After an 11,000-mile flight across the globe,she was greeted by Johnstone's astonished flatmate asking what she was doing there.
""The terrible truth dawned when I found that Lan's rucksack and most of his clothes were missing.I sat on the end of his bed and cried my eyes out.And that really annoyed me,""she said.
Johnstone,a 27-year-old bricklayer,had taken a year off to travel round Australia.But he was missing Dolby,a 26-year-old secretary,so much he got a job on a Sydney building site and started saving for a surprise.
He then flew home to Britain and went to her apartment armed with an engagement ring,champagne and flowers.
""I really missed Amy and I'd been thinking about her all the time.I thought she was winding me up when she phoned me from Australia.""he said.
Johnstone then asked Dolby to marry him on the phone.""I didn't know whether to laugh or cry but I accepted,""she said.
