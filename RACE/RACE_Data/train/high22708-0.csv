0,D,"['Getting ready for news listening.', 'Making suggestions while listening.', 'Doing follow-up activities after listening.', 'Listening practice after the proposal.']",Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the passage?,"TV is an excellent resource for hearing and listening to English. The pictures help you understand what is being said and TV news is an ideal way to help improve your listening ability because within a short period of time the same news is often repeated. This means that you can watch basically the same news program several times within a day and that every  _ program will help you to understand what is being said.
These preparatory steps are very important before your listening:
* Find out which news report you want to listen to, when and on what channel. CCTV 9 is a good choice because this is China's English channel and has regular news reports.
* Just watch the news reports for a few days first, before requiring yourself to understand the stories. Give yourself time to get familiar with the newsreaders and their accents. You should also get an idea of the structure of the entire report as well as the structure of a typical news story.
* Watch the news in Chinese first. This will tell you what the main news items are and help prepare you for understanding news reports in English.
While listening, you should pay attention to a few things that you may try to do:
* You can aim at just getting what a story is about. Give a one-to -tow-sentence description after each story.
* Put forward a few questions to yourself about a story, and then seek to answer them from your listening. You can do this by stopping the tape as soon as the headline is read to you. 
* Your may write a full transcript  of a story to practice intensive listening. This may bring to notice listening problems that have skipped your attention when you only concentrate on the content.
  Even though the listening part is over, some follow-up activities will help you reinforce  your learning. You may talk about the news with one or more friends. This provides an opportunity to produce a summary or express your thoughts in a brief article.",high22708.txt
