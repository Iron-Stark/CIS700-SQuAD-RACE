3,D,"['goes around the Sun', 'goes around itself', 'faces the Sun', 'is away from the Sun']","When it is night, the half of the Earth   _  .","We live on the Earth. It's our home. But how much do you know about it?
The Earth is like a huge ball. Like the other seven planets, the Earth is running around the Sun. It's the third nearest planet to the Sun. It takes the Earth about 365 days to run around the Sun. At the same time, the Earth is going around itself. If you are in space, you can see lots of white clouds over the surface of the Earth. Through the clouds, you can see the blue color of the oceans and the brown color of the land. About 70% of the Earth is covered with water.
Why do we have day and night? When the half of the Earth is facing the Sun, it's daytime. As the Earth turns and this half is away from the Sun, night is coming. And it's daytime for the other half.",middle5792.txt
