2,C,"[""John can't count numbers."", 'John likes tea-time.', ""It's not easy for John to tell time."", ""John's mother can't teach.""]",Which of the following is the main idea of this passage?,"John is five years old now. He is a good boy. He is very clever and can read very well. But he can't tell the right time by clock. He doesn't say eight o'clock in the morning, twelve o'clock or four o'clock in the afternoon. He always says ""breakfast time"" for eight o'clock, ""lunch time"" for twelve o'clock and ""tea-time"" for four o'clock in the afternoon. His mother wants to teach him to know the time by clock.
""Can you count, John?"" his mother asks him. ""Yes. Let me count for you. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, and twelve..."" ""That's good, John. Now let me tell you to say the time. Now, look! I put the long hand on twelve and the short hand on one. That is one o'clock. If I put the short on two, that's two o'clock. Do you know?""
""Yes, I do."" John tells his mother. ""Good. If I put the short hand on four, what's that?"" his mother asks and really puts the short one on four. ""Tea-time, Mum. And I am hungry.""",middle7851.txt
