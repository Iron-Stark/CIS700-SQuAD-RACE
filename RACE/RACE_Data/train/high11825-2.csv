2,C,"[""in charge of Fredy's loans"", 'still washing car windshields', 'full - time employed at the hotel', 'arranging dinner parties for the hotel']",Pearman is now_.,"Robert Fredy was general manager of a large hotel in Ashbury park. New Jersey. One cold day two years ago when he stopped his car at a traffic light, Stephen Pear man, an out-of-work taxi and truck driver, walked up to Fredy's car hoping to earn some change by washing his windshield.Like many motorists who try to keep the beggars off, Fredy turned on the wipers to show he wasn't interested.
Pearman put his head close to the window.""Come on, mister.Give me a chance.I need a job,"" he said.Something in Stephen Pearman's voice moved Robert Fredy.In the seconds before traffic started moving again, Fredy handed a business card and told him to call if he was serious.
""My friends told me he was just pulling my leg, ""said Pearman.""But I said, "" No, he's a
businessman.I need to give it a shot.""
Two days later,29-year-old Pearman appeared in the manager's office of the big hotel.Fredy gave him a job and housing and lent him pocket money while training him.
Today, Pearman works full time setting up the hotel's dining halls for business meetings.In the past two years, he has found a flat, married and repaid Fredy's loans.
""Mr.Fredy gave me a second chance, ""says Pearman, "" And I took advantage of it.I could have just come here a while, eaten up and left.But there is no future in washing windshields.""
Ordinarily, Fredy keeps away from the street people.""But Pearman seemed so honest and open, asking for a chance rather than just money,"" Fredy says, ""I don't hand my business card to just anybody.But I'm glad I did in this case.""",high11825.txt
