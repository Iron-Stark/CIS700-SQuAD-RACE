But on December 5th, Roman got a phone call that changed everything. Melissa had been in a terrible car accident, and the doctor had little hope she would make it.
""He said the next six to eight hours were critical in determining whether she would live or not. And I just wept,"" Roman said. ""A lot of pressure built up inside, and I just dropped my cell phone on the ground when I heard that. It was the worst feeling that I've ever felt.""
Melissa, a college English professor, was on her way to class when her car hit into a mound of dirt and rolled over several times.
Roman recalled, ""I could only think how I am going to raise my kids without their mother. If she did live, how would I take care of her and my kids? The questions you never want to ask yourself, I had to face.""
Melissa survived the first night. She had injuries to her stomach and lungs and worse, she suffered severe injuries to her brain. She didn't recognize anyone, even her own husband.
""Over the next few days, she remained unresponsive to treatments. The brain surgeon never really gave us much hope.""
Days passed and Melissa didn't improve. Christmas Eve, Roman was by her side in the hospital. Then, he received a Christmas gift he would never forget.
""That evening, she woke up and was just as clear as before, recognized everybody, and was able to read. It was just amazing. I saw her bright smile and her sense of humor. The only way I could describe it is that the weight of the darkness that had hovered over me was just completely gone.""
Melissa quickly improved, and she is back to being a wife, mom, and professor. There is no sign of damage from the brain.
Melissa said, ""I thank him for everything now. It's not just 'thank you for my job, thank you for my children.' It's 'thank you for every aspect of my life.'""",high19313.txt
