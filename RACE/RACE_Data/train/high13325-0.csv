Do you still dare eat cancer-linked processed meat ? Here are some comments on the website.
Bill (Australia) I'd rather live a short, pleasant life than a long, unhappy one, denying  myself tasty food just because some experts say it's not healthy. We should all enjoy the one life we have ---if I had listened to every piece of health advice I would never go anywhere, eat anything or enjoy life in any way. So, I won't change my habit. I am going to have bacon sandwich, glass of wine, burger, can of coke whenever I fell like it.
Tim (America) Is meat really as bad as smoking: I don't think so. According to the WHO 34,000 people die worldwide per year because they eat processed meat. In 2012, 8.2 million people died of cancer worldwide. That means if you eat a lot of processed meat you have a chance of being among the 0.41 percent of people dying of cancer because of processed meat. I'll take the chance.
Helen (Switzerland) The WHO doesn't say that just one bite of meat causes cancer, it is rather saying that people should vary their diet. People who eat more meat often have other unhealthy habits. They usually eat fewer fruits and vegetables and they also often exercise less.
Van (China) Perhaps this report will make people consider becoming vegetarians ( ). So for your health, the environment and future generations, it is not difficult; it just needs a change of attitude. There is a vast variety of other delicious food available to enjoy.",high13325.txt
