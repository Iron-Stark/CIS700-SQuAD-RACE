And that means plenty of pockets for our growing stock of digital things.
Summer, in fact, is a pocket-free zone. No pockets in T-shirts. No pockets in gym shorts. Those few pockets that can be used quickly become full of things.
Mobile phone, PDA, MP3 player or CD player, digital camera -- it's enough to make your pants torn as you walk down on the stairs or through the parking lot. Attempts have been made to help these things, but without success. One way is to put them to your belt. A mobile phone often goes this way and it's easy for you to make a phone, but it gathered to your belt, so it becomes a little unpleasant when you sit. Another way is to carry a bag to put all these things into it, but it troubles when you use them. 
Designers have been puzzling over this problem for a while and one company has come up with a possible solution.
Called the Scott e-Vest, it is a lightweight vest with more than a dozen pockets. Wearers have a lot of room for mobile phones, PDAs, CD players and much more. Better yet, built-in wiring system called PAN, for ""personal area network"" allows wearers to use their things in addition to carrying them about. 
Connect the mobile phone to the PAN, for example, you can answer a phone call by putting in your earpiece and pressing a button through the vest's fabric . At the same time, the wiring system keeps the headphones for your CD player in place and ready for instant use.
Besides these things, the vest has pockets for keys, a pen and even a ""cup holder"" pocket for drinks.
At about $160, the Scott e-Vest is not cheap. Finally, our growing pile of things will get smaller and fewer as they merge. Until then, a vest-like coat that keeps our things a accessible might be the perfect carrying case.",high17589.txt
