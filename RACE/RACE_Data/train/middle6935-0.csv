But do you know the most powerful way to encourage them to be so? The answer is to allow them to make their own decisions.
Different people have different ideas about children's decision making. Unfortunately , most parents make decisions for their children--what they wear, what they eat and what movies they watch. In fact, it's not good for children's growing.
Children should be allowed to make decisions when they are very young. But this doesn't mean they are allowed to do everything. For example, you shouldn't take your children into a convenience store and tell them they can have anything they want. They would be overwhelmed  by the choices. But you can give them a choice among snacks. When children get older, expand   the number of choices you give them. For example, allow them to decide the activities they want to take part in or when they decide to go to bed.
The next step is to get your children to think before they act. Ask themselves several important questions. First, why do I want to do this? Second, what are my choices? Third, what are the results of the actions? After the three questions, they are sure to have right decisions.",middle6935.txt
