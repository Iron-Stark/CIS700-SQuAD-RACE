1,A,"['He makes them widely known to English speakers.', 'He makes them known only to English learners.', 'He keeps them for himself for fun.', 'He sells them to radio announcers.']","What does Mr. Shafer do with some of his ""bloopers""?","People who are learning a foreign language should not feel embarrassed   because they sometimes use the wrong word. From time to time we all have difficulty even with our own language.
    If people think that these mistakes are funny, they may laugh; but they do not mean to be rude. The important thing is that they admire people who try to speak their language.
    Every public speaker knows that mistakes can happen. Even radio announcers will sometimes use the wrong word or call somebody by the wrong name. This happens so often, in fact, that a man in New York is able to make a living by listening to the radio and recording all the mistakes that he hears.
    Kermit Shafter calls these mistakes ""bloopers"". In his home, Mr. Shafter has many radios turned to different stations to record every mistake that is made. He puts the funniest ones on records and in books, which have become very popular wherever English is spoken.
    If Mr. Shafer took his tape recorder into a school where students are learning to speak English, he would very soon have enough bloopers for another book. Mistakes can be fun if we are not easily embarrassed. They also remind us to say something correctly the next time.",high22719.txt
