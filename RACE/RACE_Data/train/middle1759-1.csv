1,B,"['because they want to be good readers', 'to write stories or books for people to read', 'to find good work some day', 'to get more money to keep a family']",Some children want to be writers   _  .,"Some children want to be writers some day. They mean that they want to write stories or books for people to read. That's good! It's good to write something for people to read!

They should read a lot of books, and read for hours and hours every day instead   of watching TV and spending a lot of time playing games when they are free.
If you are a good reader, it doesn't take you long to do the reading homework. Then you have time to read many other books for fun. Because you read so well, you have more fun in reading and you want to look for more books to read.
Before you decide to be a good writer, you'd better say to yourself, ""I must read and read and read more and more!""",middle1759.txt
