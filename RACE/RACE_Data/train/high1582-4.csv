My Diary
MONDAY: I'm officially a Facebooker. I find a few people I used to know and I've soon got seven friends. I've never felt so popular! I wonder if my old university flatmate Steve is on here...What do you know! He is! Maybe Facebook has its uses.
TUESDAY: I've received lots of nice welcoming messages on my wall. Later, I meet up with Steve for a drink after not seeing him for five years. We get on really well! Then, he uses his Facebook app for iPhone to suggest me as a friend to some other former classmates. Some of them even come to the pub and it's just like old times - possibly a bit too much like old times. During the night, photos are uploaded to Facebook.
WEDNESDAY: Disaster! My mum's on Facebook! Has she seen the photos of me dancing on the table from last night? Has she shown them to dad? Oh. And I have a friend request - mum again!
THURSDAY: There's a message from my boyfriend, ""so, it's over then, ;is it?"" Evidently I haven't changed my settings to show I'm ""in a relationship"", and I haven't even added him as a friend. Ah, well, I wonder what my ex-boyfriend is doing... Whoops! I accidentally type his name into my status box instead of the search ' and now every one can see it on their news feed.'
FRIDAY: Time to update my status:""Work is boring. Can't wait for the weekend!"" Yeah, that about sums it up. Oh, look, I've received a comment! Someone must feel the same way. Lots of my friends now""like"" this status.
SATURDAY: Good news! I've got 100 friends But wait! _ I look through my ""friend list"" to try to work out who it was. Why did they do that? Am I really such a terrible person? I never knew Facebook could be this cruel.
SUNDAY: Wake up. Check my Facebook page. Make coffee. Check my Facebook page again. Get ready to leave. Change my mind and check my Facebook page ... again. I am becoming addicted to it! I think it's time to end it all before it takes over my life. I delete my account. Back to good, old, simple e-mails. Oh, look, I've got a message: A friend invited you to join Twitter. . .
