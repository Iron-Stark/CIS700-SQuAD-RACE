2,B,"['are the members of the army', 'are willing to help the poor', 'serve at the local church', 'are local shop assistants']","According to the passage, people from the Salvation Army  _  .","On a cold winter morning in the late 1930s, Bobby awoke early. It was a day that Bobby would never forget. Bobby, his brother and his mother were once again abandoned  by his father. When times got hard, the man left home. Bobby wasn't surprised. He must take the responsibility for caring for his family. 
He put on the warmest clothes he had and pulled on his old socks and torn shoes. After thinking of a way to keep his feet dry, he went outside looking for work.
Coming across some men working on the road, he joined in and worked hard for hours. Suddenly, rain poured down. ""Go home and get out of this weather,"" the men shouted, giving him a few coins.
Bobby used the money to buy as much food as he could afford in the nearest store. While holding a small bag of food ,Bobby stopped to adjust  the thick paper in his shoes.
A man, who was a member of the Salvation Army, saw Bobby's problem. He bought Bobby a new pair of shoes.
I wasn't there on that cold day. But I've heard the story many times and can always imagine my father, as a child, dancing and wearing a pair of new shoes home.
Several years later, Bobby joined the navy. He continued to support his family and meanwhile worked for the Salvation Army so that another little boy somewhere might receive a new pair of shoes for Christmas.
The tradition lasted until my father became too ill. Daddy died six years ago. While the new shoes kept his feet warm in the 1930s, Daddy's act of giving back for tens of years warmed his heart in a greater way.",high20193.txt
