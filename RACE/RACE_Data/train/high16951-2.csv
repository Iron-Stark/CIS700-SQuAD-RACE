His new book, Touch the Top of the  World, A blind Man's Journey to Climb Farther than the Eye Can See, describes his blindness and climbing. He is the first blind man to attempt Everest. The team reached base camp at 17,800 feet last Wednesday and begins its climb Saturday. If all goes well, Weihenmayer will reach the top on or about May 15.

Weihenmayer has climbed the highest peaks on four continents: North America's Mount McKinley, South America's Aconcagua, Africa's Kilimanjaro and Antarctica's Vinson Massif.
