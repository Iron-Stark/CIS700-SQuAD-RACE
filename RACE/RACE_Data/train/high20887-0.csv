0,A,"['anti aging creams', 'anti aging foods', 'anti wrinkle face', 'anti wrinkle skin']",This passage mainly tells us something about   _  .,"One of today's hottest topics among women (and to an extent among men too now) is anti aging and how to reverse the signs of age.The beauty industry has responded to this by offering a wide collection of anti aging creams and other anti aging products aimed at all pocketbooks,ranging from economical to highly priced.
And the question is ""do any of these often much-vaunted   anti aging creams actually work?"" And if they do,how precisely do they perform their miracles? 
Well the appropriate response to that is that they do work - after a fashion.There certainly are anti aging creams available for a  ly modest price that will reduce the appearance of wrinkles in a comparatively short period of regular application.But this really is the limit of their powers: they won't actually undo skin damage or eradicate   all signs of age;they will simply modify them,some more effectively than others.
The way they work is like so: they remove upper layers of dead skin cells and make deeper layers absorb water,serving to plump them up and make them look fuller and healthier.But since such anti aging creams only go skin deep,as it were,skin damage will reappear once you stop using the anti aging wrinkle cream.
This means fairly heavy regular use,which might be costly depending on your choice of product.However,if you can afford it or think it's worth the cost,it won't be such an issue.After all,what woman wants to look older than her years when looking good is so tied up with many women's self-esteem and sense of identity.
A compromise   solution for those  _ is to use the cheaper creams.In addition,it's always wise to be a little experimental to make sure you end up with the one that suits your skin best.
So,to sum up: an anti wrinkle face cream will work within limits,depending on your objective.",high20887.txt
