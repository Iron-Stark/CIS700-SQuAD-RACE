3,C,"['Liu Qian is a born magician', 'Liu Qian studied magic at university.', 'Liu Qian became successful mainly because he was hard-working.', 'Godmother helped him.']",Which of the following is true according to the passage?,"Liu Qian, a magician from Taiwan, cast his spell over an audience of thousands on the CCTV Spring Festival Show. Die-hard fans are still trying to work out the secrets behind many of the tricks he performed.
But Liu, 32, when asked, laughed off the idea that there might be an ""answer"" to his magic. ""The most fascinating things about magic is the puzzling process. People enjoy how magicians make the impossible come true,"" said Liu.
Few people today believe in the possibility of real magic. They also often fail to consider magicians' devotion to their art. It can take a magician years' of practice to perfect a trick before he performs it on stage.
Part of Liu's star appeal is his astonishing skill. However, when he began in the industry, he was embarrassingly clumsy. ""I could practice thousands of times for one single act. It wasn't much fun,"" he said.
No magician's supernatural powers on stage extend to their life off stage. Liu says his life was no easier or funnier because he was a magician.
He developed an interest in magic at a young age, but didn't consider making a living out of it until he graduated from university. He had studied Japanese language and found himself unable to find a job. ""My parents never considered being a magician as a proper job. To begin with, I had little confidence I would be doing this in the long term,"" he said.
Yet Liu felt a powerful calling to become a magician. ""For many people, magic somehow means a miracle, which is something we all secretly wish for no matter how hard-bitten or cynical  we become,"" he said.
Liu may be right. A popular modern dream is of the fairy godmother, who waves her magic wand   and makes our dreams come true. But according to Liu, we all have the power to create magic in our lives. As Liu puts it: it's not the magic that makes it work;it's the way we work that makes it magic.",high16752.txt
