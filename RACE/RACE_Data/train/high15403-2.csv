2,A,"['told him about the message from Santa', 'loved him very much', 'cared about how he behaved', 'bought him anything']",Troubled's parents never    _   .,"""I don't believe in Santa Claus!"" Trogmire announced.
Tremor looked shocked. ""Why not?"" he asked.
""Because he never leaves me any gifts at all,"" Trogmire growled.
Tremor thought about the evidence for a few seconds. ""Maybe,"" he suggested, ""it's because when Santa checked his list, your name wasn't in the 'nice' column.""
""So, he could at least bring me a lump of coal!"" Trogmire replied. ""And,"" he went on, ""Troubled doesn't believe in Santa, either.""
""Right,"" Tremor said, ""because he saw his parents putting the 'From Santa' presents under the tree. But I know the truth about that. My mother found out from Troubled's mother. When Troubled's parents got an e-mail from Santa, saying that he would never bring Troubled another gift, they didn't want to tell him the truth. So now they buy presents and pretend they're from Santa.""
""What did Troubled do to get Santa so mad?"" Trogmire questioned.
""I think it had something to do with the time he put glue paper all over the living room floor on Christmas Eve, and left a sign that said, 'Trapped like a rat!' hanging over the fireplace."" said Tremor.
""I guess Santa doesn't have a sense of humour,"" sighed Trogmire. ""Well, at least I'm not the only one who Santa scratched off his name list.""",high15403.txt
