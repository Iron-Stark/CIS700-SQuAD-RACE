0,C,"['No perfect man exists in this world.', 'We should learn to be kind to ourselves.', ""We sometimes don't have to mind too much the way we are."", 'Once we have shortcomings, we should try to overcome them.']",What's the moral of the passage?,"A water bearer in India had two large pots,each hung on each end of a pole which he neck. One of the pots had a crack  in it, and while the other pot was perfect and always delivered a full load of water at the end of the long walk from the stream to the master's house, the cracked pot arrived only half full. 
For two years this went on daily. The perfect pot was proud of its accomplishment. Of course,the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own imperfection. After two years of this sense of bitter failure, it spoke one day to the water bearer by the stream. 
""I am ashamed of myself, and I want to apologize to you. ""
""Why?"" asked the bearer. ""What are you ashamed of?""
""I have been able for these last two years to deliver only half my load, because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back. And you do no get full value for your efforts"" the pot explained. 
The water bearer, hearing this, said, ""As we return to the master's house, I want you to notice the beautiful flowers along the path. ""
As they wnet up the hill, the cracked pot took notice of the sun warming the beautiful wild flowers on the side of the path, and this cheered it a little. 
The bearer said, ""Did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of the path, but not on the other pot's side ?"" That is because I have known about you, and I took advantage of it. I planted flower seeds on your side of the path, and every day while we walk back from the stream, you have watered them. For two years I have been able to pick those beautiful flowers to decorate my master's table. Without you being just the way you are, he would not have this beauty in his house. """,high17003.txt
