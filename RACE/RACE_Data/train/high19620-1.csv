Our homestay families are located in areas of Vancouver,Toronto and Montreal,Canada,living from 40 to 60 minutes from the school. These homes are safe,secure,inspected and approved by our homestay program coordinators.
Your homestay family in Canada will be different from your own,especially the food and customs,but you will become one of the family!
Most Canadians work outside the home and are active in community affairs. Family members have duties around the home and do many things for themselves. For example,family members are expected to take their own dishes from the dining room to the kitchen and take care of their own possessions. This will apply to you too!
There will be many differences,both personal and cultural between you and your homestay family in Canada. We ask both you and your new family to be accepting of these differences.
Each family will assist you in learning the arrangement of your new home. You will be asked to respect the rules and regulations that are suitable for their household. If any questions arise about your new home,please feel free to ask your family.
You will be provided with a clean,comfortable,private room. The room will be furnished with a desk,bed,dresser,closet and good lighting. You are expected to keep your own room neat and tidy. You will have your own house key. Please respect the security of the household. Make sure you return the key when you leave.",high19620.txt
