3,B,"['was sent to Europe during the war.', 'was not afraid of blood.', 'decided to give up his doctor career.', 'regarded himself as a life-saver.']",From the passage we can infer  that Tim  _  .,"When he was a boy, Tim was much influenced  by the books about the sea, but in fact by the age of fifteen he had decided to become a doctor rather than a sailor. His father was a dentist and as a result, Tim had the opportunity of meeting many doctors either at home or elsewhere. When he was fourteen he was already hanging around the clinic   of a local doctor where he was supposed to help to wrap up medicine bottles, but was actually trying to listen to the conversations taking place between the doctor and his patients in the next room.
During the war Tim served in the Navy   as a surgeon  . ""That was the happiest time of my life. I was dealing with very real suffering and on the whole making a success of it."" In California he taught the country people simple facts about medicine. He saw himself as a life-saver. He had proved his skills to himself and his ability to take decisions. Thus, while he was able to tell them what to do, he could feel he was saving them. After the war, he got married and chose to be a doctor in the countryside, working under an old doctor who was popular in the area, but who hated the sight of blood and believed that the secret of medicine was faith. This gave the young man many opportunities to go on working as a life-saver.",high1035.txt
