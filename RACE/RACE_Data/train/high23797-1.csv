1,B,"['help kids in Cuba build their acting career', ""improve some poor children's health"", 'offer medical supplies to the homeless', 'provide the elderly with financial support']",Corey raises money in order to   _,"He is a familiar sight, the old man who asks change from drivers stopped at a red light on East 35th Street in Slidtown Manhattan every day. After all, he has been at it for 17 years now, seven days a week. With the help of a walker, he hobbles between lanes of traffic, approaching drivers, offering newspapers --- often a free paper collected from boxes on the sidewalk nearby --and asking for change.""Help a guy out?"" he repeats to drivers who will usually hand over a dollar or some change.
   Most drivers simply regard him as another homeless down-and-out  ,but every so often one might realize that it's the legendary  comedian Professor Irwin Corey, who is now 98.
   Over his eight-decade career, he has been on television and in comedy clubs, nightclubs and concert halls worldwide. He began his stage career on Broadway in 1943. Indeed, he still performs fairly regularly -- a week ago he flew to Chicago to play two nights at a local club.
  And though he has a homeless appearance, Mr. Corey lives in a comfortable 1840 carriage house on East 36th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues that he estimates   could sell for $3.5 million.
   Mr. Corey said he gathers his daily take-- usually about $100, though there have been $250 days-- every few months and donates the money to a charity that buys medical supplies for children in Cuba. As for the drivers he solicits, Mr. Corey said, ""I don't tell them where the money's going, and I'm sure they don't care.""
Mr. Corey has traveled to Cuba to donate personally. There are photographs of him with President Fidel Castro on his wall. One is with an inscription  by Castro: With admiration, gratitude and affection.",high23797.txt
