0,C,"['They want to see the priest.', 'They are on holiday.', 'The church is an old building.', 'They want to see the baby.']",Why are Jack and Mike in the church?,"Jack and Mike are on holiday in France. Mike loves visiting old building. So does Jack.
In the village Jack and Mike see a beautiful old church  , but when they come into the church, some people are there. They don't know what the people are doing.
""Oh! Just sit quietly  , and act like the others!""Mike says. Because they don't really know French, so they stand, kneel and sit to follow other people.
At that time, the priest   says something. And the man who sits next to Jack and Mike stands up.
""We should stand up, too!""Jack whispers to Mike.
So, Jack and Mike walk to the priest. ""What's so funny?""Jack asks in English.
With a smile on his face the priest says, ""Boys, there is a newbaby born, we ask the father to stand up.""
Mike shakes his head. He smiles and says, ""We should understand what people do before we act like them!""",middle5899.txt
