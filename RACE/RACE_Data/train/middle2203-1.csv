1,B,"['To teach the boy not to steal.', 'To punish the boy for stealing.', 'To teach Billy to forgive others.', 'To teach Billy to share with others.']",Which of the following is NOT the camp leader's intension  ?,"A small boy at summer camp received a bag of cookies in the mail from his mother. He ate a few, and then put the rest under his bed. The next day, after lunch, he went to his tent to get a cookie. The box was gone.
That afternoon a camp leader saw another boy sitting behind a tree. He was eating the stolen cookies! ""That young man,"" he said to himself, ""must be taught not to steal.""
He returned to the group and found the boy whose cookies had been stolen. ""Billy,"" he said, ""I know who stole your cookies. Will you help me teach him a lesson?""
""Well, yes. But aren't you going to punish him?"" asked the puzzled boy.
""No, that would only make him hate you."" the leader explained. ""I want you to call your mother. Ask her to send you another box of cookies.""
The boy did so and soon received another box of cookies. ""Now,"" said the leader, ""the boy who stole your cookies is down by the lake. Go and share your cookies with him.""
""But he's the thief!""
""I know, but try it--see what will happen.""
Half an hour later, the camp leader saw the two come up the hill, hand in hand. The boy who had stolen the cookies was trying to get the other to accept his toy knife. The other boy was just refusing the gift from his new friend. He said that a few cookies weren't that important anyway.",middle2203.txt
