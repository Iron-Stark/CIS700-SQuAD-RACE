2,D,"['The patient will be in danger if he takes as much as a full spoon of the medicine.', 'The doctor will be in trouble if he gives the patient a full spoon of the medicine.', 'If the patient wants to be alive, he should take the medicine no more than five drops.', 'If one full spoon of the medicine is too much, less than it should be all right to the patient.']",Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?,"There was once a professor of medicine, who was very strict with the students.Whenever he took the chair on the exam committee , the students would be in fear, because he was hardly pleased with the answers they gave.A student would be lucky enough if he or she could receive a good mark from him.At the end of the term, the students of medicine would take their exam again.
Now a student entered the exam room and got seated before the committee.This student was a little nervous as he knew it would not be so easy to get through the exam at all.

""A full spoon,"" answered the student.

A full spoon is too much for the patient.He can take only five drops."" 
""I'm sorry, sir,"" said the professor coldly, ""but it's too late.Your patient has died.""",high22853.txt
