Mr. Smith decided to change his body. He changed his big nose to a small one, and his old and gray hair to short and blond hair. He also bought new green eyes, new hands, new arms, new knees and new feet. Mrs. Smith was happy because Mr. Smith's new feet didn't smell as bad as his old feet.
However, something bad happened. One morning, Mr. Smith woke up and his new nose didn't work. The next morning he couldn't hear anything. Then his new blond hair went gray, and his new knees didn't move. And finally he could see nothing with his green eyes.
It was really terrible. Mr. Smith wanted his old body back. However, he had to pay 100,000 euro  for his old body.
It was expensive but Mr. Smith still got his own body back. He would never follow the fashion.
