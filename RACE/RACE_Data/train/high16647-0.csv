For many students, it's easy to get to school. But for the students in a village in Sichuan province, it is difficult. There is a very big river between their school and the village. There is no bridge and the river runs too quickly for boats. So these students go on a ropeway to cross the river to school.
One 11-year-old boy, Liang liang, crosses the river every day. But she is not afraid. ""I love to play with my classmates. And I love my teacher. He's like a father to me.""
