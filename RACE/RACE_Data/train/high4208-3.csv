3,B,"['Most heart diseases have been proved to be linked to passive smoking.', 'A new law will soon come out with a total ban on smoking in vehicles', 'Cigarette-making factories will disappear soon.', 'Most of the school grounds are not smoke-free, as it is not banned in the law.']",What can you infer from the article?,"How did a ban on smoking in public places come into place?
In 1998 the Smoking Kills White Paper set out a national strategy   to reduce smoking prevalence   and passive smoking, including in public places. The measures were voluntary and poorly carried out. After a public conference in England in 2004, the Government decided to choose for lawmaking. Scotland went first, with a ban in 2006, followed by the other nations a year later.
What is the current law?
Any person who smokes in enclosed   public places, including pubs, offices, on public transport and work vehicles, is breaking the law. It does not extend to private houses. It is also an offence for people in charge of premises   to permit others to smoke in them.
How was it received?
It was welcomed by most organizations except for some pub owners and restaurateurs. Many workplaces in the UK had already introduced smoke-free policies consistent with the legislation (,) before it was carried out, while others have gone beyond its basic requirements.
All railway facilities, including platforms, footbridges and other areas--whether or not fitting the definition of an enclosed public space--are covered, as are all football grounds and some cricket and athletics stadiums. School grounds are not required to be smoke-free under the legislation, but the majority now are.
How has it been forced?
Compliance   in public premises has been high, with inspections suggesting that 99 per cent of places were sticking to the rules. The number of people charged for smoking in cars has been very low, which was due to the problems defining and identifying ""work"" vehicles. They said that a total ban on smoking in vehicles would end this confusion.
Has it improved health?
Studies in early adopters of the law, including in Scotland, suggest a reduction in hospital admissions for heart disease, which has been shown to be linked to passive smoking. There is also strong evidence of improved rates of smoking end and a drop in the number of cigarettes consumed by those who continue to smoke.",high4208.txt
