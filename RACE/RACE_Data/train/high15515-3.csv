Q: Why , after 600 years of no activity , did Mount Pinatubo in Philippines erupt in 1991 ?
A: Volcanoes  each have their own eruption styles . This volcano probably has a rule which makes it erupt in the order of every 500 to 1000 years , but a volcano in Hawaii seems to erupt every year , and some of the Alaskan volcanoes might erupt every 10 or 20 years .
Q: So nothing caused it ?
A: There's nothing out of the ordinary . If you were to take an ordinary calendar year , 50 to 75 or 80 volcanoes erupt around the world every year . There are 20 to 30 volcanoes every month that show signs of unrest . That might be a full-blown eruption or a whole host of activities like that .
Q: What is ""the ring of fire"" ?
A: If you look at where active volcanoes are placed around the world , there are somewhere between 500 and 600 of them . There is what appears to be almost a necklace that goes around the Pacific Ocean . It makes a ring where 60% of the world's volcanoes lie .
Q: Why such a concentration there ?
A: That's based on a theory that the oceans and the continents are like separate pieces . When continents and when that happens it seems to produce magma at depth and then you have volcanoes in the same ring .",high15515.txt
