Joe answered: ""I guess when I was cleaning the barn ! ""
The children looked for more than two hours but could not find it.
One grandson went to search  the barn again, and he asked the others not to follow him and to keep silent .
He was there for about 15 minutes and then rushed to his grandfather. He found the watch!
Joe was surprised and asked how he was able to find it. The little boy said: ;'I sat there without making a noise, and the barn was so silent. After a few minutes, I heard the 'tick, tick' sound and found the watch.""
