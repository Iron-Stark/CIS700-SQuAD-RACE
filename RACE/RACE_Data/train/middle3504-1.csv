As a child, Monty often went from one farm to another with his father. Sometimes they didn't have money to pay for food, but Monty still kept hoping to own a horse farm.
When he was in school, his teacher asked him to write a paper about his dream. He wrote a seven-page paper. He wanted to have a horse farm one day. He even drew a picture of a horse farm in the paper.

So the boy did and asked his teacher, ""Why did I get an F?"" The teacher said, ""This dream will not come true for a young boy like you. You need a lot of money to own a horse farm. You have to buy the land. You have to pay for a lot of things. There is no way you could ever do it."" Then the teacher added, ""If you write this paper again with a simpler dream, I will give you a good grade.""
After school he thought hard about it. At last, he decided to hand in the same paper, making no changes at all. He said to the teacher, ""You can keep the F and I'll keep my dream.""
Many years later, Monty had his own large horse farm. His dream came true.
