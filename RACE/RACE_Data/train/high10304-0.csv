0,D,"['what he wears', 'what he does or has', 'our first feelings and thoughts', ""what's going on inside him""]","When we judge a person, we should pay more attention to   _  .","Give people a chance before you judge them because you really never know what's going on beneath the surface. I am always reminded that judging a person by what others say or my first impression is usually wrong.
It's so easy to make assumptions  and expectations about someone, just to find out they were completely false. The shy girl turns out to be one of the funniest girls I've ever met; the mean girl is actually very sensitive and loving; the _ guy is unsure of himself, etc.
I hope there is a world where we stop judging a person by what they wear, their hairstyle, their job, their car; we simply love and accept them for who they are. Someone may have untidy hair because they over slept, or their clothes don't match because their house burned down and lost everything. All I'm saying is, ""can we focus more on what's going on inside a person rather than the outside?""
There are so many people who seem like everything is just fine on the outside, but the inside is angry or hurting. They don't know how to just be themselves or they're afraid to because they may be seen as the ""crazy"" or ""strange"" persons.
I truly believe everything begins with ourselves. Before we can really stop judging others by the outside, we must stop judging ourselves. We must know how to treat ourselves first. Let's stop getting in our own way and accept ourselves and others as we are.",high10304.txt
