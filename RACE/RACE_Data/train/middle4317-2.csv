Bob's story began in a small city of England. His family was poor. Seven people lived in a small house. Bob had no place to play but on the street.
Kids in the city like playing football very much. Little Bob wanted to play football, too. So his father made a soft   ball for him to kick. It was a sock full of old cloth. He kicked it every day.
At last ,Bob learned how to kick a real football. And after a few years, he could play football very well.
