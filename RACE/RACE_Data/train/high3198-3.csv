3,A,"['the road to the country is very busy on a public holiday.', 'the cars were too many to move that day.', 'seeing 200 sheep coming, they were very afraid.', ""that day they didn't have any meal.""]",Which of the following is true?,"Nobody likes staying at home in a public holiday, especially when the weather is fine. Last august we decided to spend the day in the country. The only difficulty was that millions of other people had exactly the same idea.  We moved out of the city slowly behind a long line of cars. But at last we came to a quiet country road and after some time, stopped at a lonely farm. We had brought plenty of food with us and we got it out of the car. It was very peaceful in the cool grass until we heard ringing at the top of the hill. What we saw made us pick up our things and run back to the car as quickly as possible. There were about two hundred sheep coming towards us down the path.",high3198.txt
