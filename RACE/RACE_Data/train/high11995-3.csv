This sport takes you into a wonderful new world. It is like a visit to the moon!When you are under water,it is easy for you to climb big rocks, because you are no longer heavy.
Here,under water,everything is blue and green.During the day,there is enough light. When fish swim nearby,you can catch them with your hands.
When you have tanks of air on your back,you can stay in deep water for a long time.But you must be careful.
To catch the fish is one of the most interesting parts of this sport.On the other hand, you can clean the ships without taking them out of the water.You can get many things from the deep sea.
Now you can see that skin-diving is both useful and interesting.",high11995.txt
