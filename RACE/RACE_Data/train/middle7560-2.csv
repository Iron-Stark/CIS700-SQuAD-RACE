2,A,"['makes her child clever and hard-working', 'does everything for her child', 'gives her child a lot of money', 'teaches her child by herself']","We can know a good mother  _  from the sentence ""A good mother is worth 100 teachers!""","When I had something difficult to do, I used to ask my mum for help. But she always said, ""Do it yourself, dear."" I was not happy about this at all. I thought she was the laziest mother in the world!
For example, one day, some of my friends would come to my home. My bedroom was really untidy. Books were all over the floor, and I didn't make the bed. So I asked my mum to help me clean it, but she still said, ""Do it yourself, my daughter.""
Because of my ""lazy mum"", I have to wash my clothes and clean my room. I have to help my parents do housework. I even have to go to hospital by myself. It is very hard to do everything well on my own, but I have learnt a lot.
As time goes by, I come to understand my mum. She makes me clever and hard-working. How great she is! A good mother is worth   100 teachers! Don't you think so?",middle7560.txt
