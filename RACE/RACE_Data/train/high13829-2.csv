2,A,"['Sunday', 'Saturday', 'Wednesday', 'Monday']",Michelle Riotton got lost on   _  .,"A GRANDMOTHER, Michelle Riotton, 78, survived after falling down a mountain valley. She set off for a walk alone dressed only in a light jacket and trousers. ""I slipped into a valley!"" said Mrs Riotton, who said the fall happened in a deep forest close to her home village.
It was warm and sunny when the accident happened, but temperatures dropped to very low when night fell, and it rained. ""I wasn't afraid,"" said Mrs Riotton. ""But I was worried that my children and grandchildren would become too worried about me."" Mrs Riotton said she covered herself in leaves when feeling cold, taking very small bites of two biscuits which she had in her pocket and drinking rainwater which fell down her face.
She spent six nights before she was found on Saturday. She was lying at the bottom of the valley, which was less than a mile from her home. The search had once been stopped, but Patrice Fossard, one of her neighbors, insisted that the search continue. ""There was no way we could give up her, even if deep inside we felt we had little hope of finding her alive,"" said Mr Fossard. ""It was a miracle that Michelle was finally found.""
Mrs Riotton said she would be taking life easier from now on. ""Enough is enough!"" she said. ""No more forests -- don't want to visit one again.""
A mountain policeman said walking alone in the mountain was not recommended and that Mrs Riotton should have carried a mobile phone with her. ""The mountains are particularly dangerous at this time of year as sunny afternoons can quickly change into cold, wet and stormy evenings."" he said. ""Anybody walking into the mountains should carry safety equipment and be prepared for any kind of emergency.""",high13829.txt
