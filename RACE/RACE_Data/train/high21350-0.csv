0,C,"['by ship', 'by truck', 'by air', 'by train']",The two new whale sharks were carried away from Taiwan   _  .,"Two new whale sharks arrived at the world's largest aquarium   on Friday.
Both whale sharks, the world's largest fish, arrived at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta after 6 a.m. The pair had been flown 8,000 miles from Taipei, Taiwan. They will join the aquarium's three whale sharks--the only ones on display outside of Asia.
"" We re the only people in the world that can claim   three times, "" aquarium director Jeff Swanagan said, "" Each time we learn more and more.""
The two young males were given Asian names. One is Taroko, named after Taroko Gorge, a national park in Taiwan. The other is Yushan, which means ""Jade Mountain"", and is named after a mountain in Taiwan.
The sharks were flown from Taiwan on a plane in 20-foot-long tanks with oxygen    machines and other equipment to keep the water suitable for them.
They arrived at about 3:30 a.m. in Atlanta, where their tanks were moved to two trucks and driven to the aquarium surrounded by some of Atlanta police cars with their blue lights flashing. They were lowered into their new home--as Norton and two females, Alice and Trixie, circled nearby, seemingly curious about the new arrivals.
It is difficult to tell the age of the whale sharks, but at least one of the new arrivals is believed to be the smallest the aquarium has got. They are believed to be the aquarium's youngest whale sharks yet.",high21350.txt
