Talking to people
English people find it difficult to start conversations with strangers.They like to be private so if they are on buses or trains, they usually sit as far away from other people as possible.If you want to start a conversation, the topic that English people are always happy to talk about is the weather.So you need to be able to say ""Isn't it warm (sunny/windy/wet/foggy) today?"" or ""Do you think it's going to rain/clear up?"" This is much better than asking about politics, religion or how much people earn!",middle6116.txt
