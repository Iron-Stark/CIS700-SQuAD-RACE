3,C,"['stay at home after leaving school', 'marry men younger than themselves', 'start working again later in life', 'marry while still at school']","According to the passage, it is now quite common for women to  _  .","During the twentieth century there has been a great change in the lives of women. A woman marrying at the end of the nineteenth century would probably have been in her middle twenties, and would be likely to have seven or eight children, of whom four or five lived until they were five years old. By the time the youngest was fifteen, the mother would have been in her early fifties and would expect to live a further twenty years, during which chance and health made it unusual for her to get paid work. Today women marry younger and have fewer children. Usually a woman's youngest child will be fifteen when she is forty-five and can be expected to live another thirty-five years and she is likely to take paid work until sixty.
This important change in women's life has only recently begun to have its full effect on women's economic   position. Even a few years ago most girls left school and took a full-time job. However, when they married, they usually left work at once and never returned to it. Today the school-leaving age is sixteen; many girls stay at school after that age, and though women marry younger, more married women stay at work at least until shortly before their first child is born. Many more afterwards return to full-time or part-time work. Such changes have produced a new relationship   in marriage, with the husband accepting a greater share of the duties and satisfactions of family life.",high20438.txt
