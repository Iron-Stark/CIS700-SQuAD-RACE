1,B,"['High and Wild is a new British adventure travel company', 'the aircraft took the jumpers to a height higher than the Himalayas', 'Ms Budge used to be an extreme sports enthusiast.', 'the three skydivers succeeded in landing at the top of the highest mountain.']",It can be known from the passage that   _  .,"""It was amazing, just impressive,"" Holly Budge, a 29-year-old British woman, said after making a safe landing at a spot 12,350 feet (3,765 meters) above sea level -- the highest ""drop zone"" achieved by a parachutist  . ""We had one minute of freefall and while we were above the clouds you could see Everest and the other high mountains popping out of the top,"" she said.
Ms Budge and her two fellow daredevils, Wendy Smith, from New Zealand, and Neil Jones, from Canada, jumped out of an aircraft at about 29,500 feet, just higher than the peak of the world's highest mountain. They fell at speeds reaching 140mph, past the highest ridges of the snow-covering Himalayas, before each released a parachute  . The jumpers wore oxygen masks to keep their lungs working as they fell. Wearing neoprene underwear  was compulsory -- to prevent them from being frozen to death.
The adventure, advertised by its organizers as ""a feast for those who seek to stimulate all their senses to the full"", appeared to have lived up to its billing. ""I had never seen so many mountains before,"" Ms Smith said. ""To be on top of the world was simply stunning .""
The expedition also offered a way by which to celebrate her 30th birthday later this month, she said. Besides, her jump raised funds for charities in Britain and Nepal, including more than PS10,000 for the Hampshire Autistic Society.
In the next few days the feat will be repeated by about 30 others, weather permitting. Each has paid at least PS12,675 to High and Wild, the British adventure travel company behind the project. Ms Budge said: ""It was worth the money. It is something that has never been done before.""",high23514.txt
