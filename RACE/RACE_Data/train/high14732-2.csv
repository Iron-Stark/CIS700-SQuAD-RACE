2,A,"['Supportive.', 'Doubtful.', 'Pessimistic.', 'Tolerant.']",What is the author's attitude towards Pod?,"A new concept vehicle, Pod was introduced by Toyota and Sony at the Tokyo motor show. The car is intended as a four-wheeled friend. It aims to provide affection, sympathy and encouragement. Like a dog welcoming its master, the car sits up, wags its tail and acknowledges its owner's presence using hydraulics  and a multi-coloured LED display panel  across the front.
While on the road, the car constantly monitors the driver's mood with pulse and sweat  sensors on the joystick . Cameras focused on the eyes keep watch for any sigh of _ . If a driver appears to be losing his or her cool, Pod will display warnings, play soft music and blow cold air at the face. Drivers are shaken awake with loud music and a shaking chair.
To improve driving skills, Pod uses a comparison to score drivers, offer advice and rank all Pod owners. Toyota claims that the car will eventually be able to learn its owner's likes and dislikes by monitoring passenger conversations. If the car hears a favorite song being discussed, it will download the track from the Internet and play it without being asked. It will also recommend  restaurants that might suit the driver's taste and take photographs of passengers when they sound particularly happy.
In keeping with the moodiness that is the car's main selling point, Pod expresses a form of road anger. If a driver brakes or swerves  suddenly, the LED panel shows an angry red and the tail rises at the back.
Anger is one of the car's ten ""emotional states"". Another is sadness --- a blue front with tear-shaped lights seemingly dropping from headlights --- which appears after a flat tire or when gas is low.
""We wanted to show that the cars can be cheerful and entertaining,"" said Yasunori Sakamoto, part of the Toyota design team. Mr Sakamoto said Toyota has no plans to put Pod on the market. Sad, really.",high14732.txt
