Dear Heli and Risto,
You are on my mind tonight because we are using the candles you gave us when you visited us two years ago.There was a horrible summer thunderstorm this evening and the power went out,and your candles were just what we needed.They have lit our dinnertime,the bedrooms and now I am sitting by one in the kitchen...
What I didn't say to Heli and Risto is that we never burned the candles before because they,well,smell like a campfire.And so they stood in iron candlesticks until we needed them.
I'm so thankful that we had candles on hand that dark night.And I'm equally as thankful that I had a beautiful card on hand,too,or I would have let the opportunity to keep in touch with faraway family escape.It would have turned into another one of those moments when the thought of sending a card crossed my mind but never actually happened.
The candle burned slowly.After I finished my card to Finland,I enjoyed looking through the rest of my ""Someone Cares"" greeting cards.The air was fresh and cool,and I had cards and enough light to write.I found a birthday card for my nephew's 10th birthday,a thinkingofyou card for my aunt,and a fun greeting card for an old friend and I began writing.Candles and cards--two things that make a thunderstorm into the perfect storm.",high16971.txt
