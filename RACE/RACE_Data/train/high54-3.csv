3,C,"['sad', 'angry', 'glad', 'worried']",The shoemaker felt very  _  when the woman rang him.,"One day I took several pairs of shoes to the shoemaker to be mended. After a week I went to take them back. Four months later, my husband and I were invited to dinner. I took out a pair of shoes. I hadn't worn them since they were mended. I put one shoe on my right foot, and then I put the other on my left. But I felt that the other one was on the wrong foot. I took both shoes off for a closer look. They were nearly the same style  , color and size, but each was for the right foot. Then I thought of the shoemaker. Though I was sure he wouldn't remember me after such a long time, I called him.  ""Thank goodness you called me at last!""  He said happily.  ""An angry woman has been troubling me for months!""",high54.txt
