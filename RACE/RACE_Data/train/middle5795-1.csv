1,B,"['she expects her mom not to catch snakes', 'she is afraid her mom will make her lose face', 'she wants her mom to be different from others', 'she wishes her mom to act more politely than the other moms']",Jane tries to make some rules for her  mom because  _  .,"My mom isn't fancy like other moms.They wear fancy clothes and drive fancy cars.My mom wears her gardening clothes when she walks me to school.
When fancy moms laugh,their laughs sound soft and whispery.You can hear my mom's laugh from down the hall.I show her how to laugh quietly and she practices.But before long she starts laughing even harder than before.
At the talent show,my mom cheers loudly,""Bravo,everyone!Bravo!""instead of clapping politely the way fancy moms do.
For our class hike ,parents are invited.At breakfast I go over my rules for Mom,""Please don't whistle.Don't laugh loudly.No clapping.And stay in line.""
The other moms show up wearing fancy jackets and sneakers.My mom wears cutoffs,a floppy straw hat,and her old hiking boots.
We hike along,all in a line.Soon Mom starts to whistle her hiking songs,She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain.I shake my head at her.She stops and whispers,""Oops.Sorry,Jane.""
We keep hiking.Everything is perfect until...
Our teacher,Ms.Steele,stops and points,""A snake!""All the moms hold their kids hands and back up,except my mom.""Watch out!It might be poisonous !""Ms.Steele says.
The other moms shuttle back some more.However,my mom steps forward and says,""Hmm.Let's see what kind it is.Nope,lt's not poisonous.""
I shut my eyes.I know what's coming next.Mom makes a sudden attack.""Got it!""she says.The other moms scream,not sounding fancy at all.
Kids gather around as Mom examines the snake.""It's OK to touch,""she says.
Everyone's too scared,but I go first.""snakes aren't slimy,""I tell them.Right away,others line up.A couple of the fancy moms come up to touch the snake's tail.
Later,Ms.Steele tells us to draw our favorite part of the hike.After a while,I look around quickly.Everyone's picture is of Mom and me with the snake.
As we hike back to the bus,I squeeze Mom's hand.""I'm glad I didn't tell you my don't-catch-snakes rule.""She smiles.But soon,she's whistling her hiking songs again!
I start to make her silent,then stop.Instead,I take a deep breath and sing out too.Everyone joins in,even the fancy moms.",middle5795.txt
