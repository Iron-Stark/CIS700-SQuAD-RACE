Children who eat an apple or pear a day may be exceeding  the pesticide  safety limit because of remains on the fruit,according to research.
Using data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit collected from supermarkets,scientists thought that each day some children would get a poisonous level of pesticides.
The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains.
But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch.
It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure  to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected  of causing cancer.
The good news for British fruit growers is that samples grown in this country had lower _ level than imported fruit,so buying home-produced fruit will reduce the danger,said Emily Diamand,one of the Earth's senior food researchers and one of the authors of the report.",high8579.txt
