1,D,"['Ordering a lot of cards you like online and sending them from the post office.', 'Getting as many cards from your electronic mail box and mailing them on the Net.', 'Sitting and writing lots of beautiful cards at home and sending them just in a traditional way.', 'Choosing personalized cards in numbers and mailing them directly on the Net.']","If you are quite busy,but having many greetings to send,which of the following is your best choice?","Since long ago,greeting cards have been considered a time-saver.More than 150 years ago,a busy Englishman,Sir Henry,asked a friend to design a card so that he didn't have to labour to write holiday letters to his friends at the end of the year.Those paper cards are now the tradition.
 _ .That's why the Internet is ready to make a change in holiday greeting customs.Already,those,who are always busy,like sending video greetings by e-mail.So,don't be surprised to find a lively card in your electronic mail box at the end of the year or at any time you should have one.
A recent survey by the Shared Greetings Company found 50 percent of all the Internet users will send online cards especially during the holiday seasons.""That is a lot easier,and it is lively,""said Carol,a New Yorker,who had stopped at the Shared Greetings Company demonstration  online.With her children's help,she sent her first e-card before Thanksgiving Day.""It was the first time I had done something like this;it's quite enjoyable,""she said.
""I will send online Christmas cards to my friends,""said Marcos,a 22-year-old student.""It costs so little and you can even send numbers of greetings at a time.""But he added ""the e-card also has its limits,and I don't think it is ready to replace the paper card for the more formal or traditional occasions.For some people,I would rather buy paper cards and mail them traditionally.I believe it is more personal and respectful in that way,""he said.
Well,for those who are very busy but still prefer to do a lot of greetings to different receivers in the holiday season,the Internet may have another way.""Now you can use the Net to decide and send as many as 50 beautiful cards,which allows the buyer to choose the inside saying,as well as the ink colour and typeface,only costing about 30 minutes,""said Julie,vice-president of marketing for an electronic card company-Hallmark Company.""And if you are in less of a hurry,you can spend another 30 minutes sitting in your home or office to create a photo card,showing off your kids,your pets or even your new house-anything as your favorite design for your relatives and friends.""",high7818.txt
