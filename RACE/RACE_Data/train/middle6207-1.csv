1,C,"['They should educate those people who are young.', 'They should educate those people who are old.', 'They should set up a much more perfect traffic system.', ""They shouldn't allow people to buy so many cars.""]",What should the governments do to make the traffic better?,"With more and more cars on the road, the traffic jam  will happen. How do we see it and how can we solve the problem?
We know that the traffic jam happens in many places, especially in big cities. What are reasons for the problem? On one hand, some people think that they should have a car when they have enough money, and then it's easy to go out and they can feel comfortable. On the other hand, a growing number of people hope to use their cars to show off . What's more, years of research has shown that one of other reasons for the traffic jam is the driving habit. For example, many young people enjoy driving very fast, so they can feel excited. At last, most of them hardly care about the speed  rules.
Many governments  are working at how to make the traffic better. In my opinion, firstly, the government should educate  those people who have cars or plan to buy cars. The governments must make them know that the traffic jam is very serious , and set up a much more perfect traffic system  to solve the traffic pressure.",middle6207.txt
