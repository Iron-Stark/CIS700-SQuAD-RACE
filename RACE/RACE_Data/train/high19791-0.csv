0,A,"[""It's a parent's letter intended for a college student."", 'Parents are proud but worried about unpredictable future of children.', 'Learning skills are the top priority in Columbia.', 'Though uneducated,the writer offers practical college guidance.']",What can be inferred from the passage?,"First,I want to tell you how proud we are.Getting into Columbia is a real testament of what a great wellrounded student you are.Your academic,artistic,and social skills have truly blossomed  in the last few years.You should be as proud of yourself as we are.
College will be the most important years in your life.It is in college that you will truly discover what learning is about.You often question""what good is this course"".I encourage you to be inquisitive,but I also want to tell you:""Education is what you have left after all that is taught is forgotten.""What I mean by that is the material taught isn't as important as you gaining the ability to learn a new subject,and the ability to analyze a new problem.That is really what learning in college is about-this will be the period where you go from teachertaught to masterinspired,after which you must become selflearner.
Do not fall into the trap of dogma .There is no single simple answer to any question.Remember during your high school debate class,I always asked you to take on the side that you don't believe in?I did that for a reason-things rarely""black and white"",and there are always many ways to look at a problem.You will become a better problem solver if you recognized that.This is called""critical thinking"",and it is the most important thinking skill you need for your life.This also means you need to become tolerant and supportive of others.I will always remember when I went to my Ph.D.advisor and proposed a new thesis topic,he said""I don't agree with you,but I'll support you.""
Follow your passion in college.Take courses you think you will enjoy.Don't be trapped in what others think or say.Steve Jobs says when you are in college,your passion will create many dots,and later in your life you will connect them.Enjoy picking your dots,and be assured one day you will find your calling,and connect a beautiful curve through the dots.
Most importantly,make friends and be happy.College friends are often the best in life,because during college you are closer to them physically than to your family.Also,going through independence and adulthood is a natural bonding experience.
Bonne chance,my angel and princess.May Columbia become the happiest four years in your life.",high19791.txt
