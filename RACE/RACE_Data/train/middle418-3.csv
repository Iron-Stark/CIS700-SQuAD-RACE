""I don't agree,"" Mrs. Wilson said, ""I think we should decide when we are going first. We don't want to go to places when they are cold."" [:Zxxk.Com]
Mr. Wilson agreed, so the family's first decision was when to go on vacation. They decided to go in July. ""Now we can decide where to go,"" said Mr. Wilson. ""But, Dad,"" Ben said, ""don't you think that where we go depends on(,)how we go? If we plan to fly, we can go a long way. If we plan to drive, we can't go far.""
Again, Mr. Wilson agreed, and they discussed this. At last they agreed to travel by plane. And so the planning meeting went on. The next day, one of Mr. Wilson's friends at work asked, ""Where are you going for vacation?""
""Well,"" Mr. Wilson told him, ""we are going in summer by plane, but I don't know where we are going!",middle418.txt
