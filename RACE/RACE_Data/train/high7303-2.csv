2,D,"['how to run after e a girl', 'a marriage in heaven', 'a moving love story', 'What true love is.']",The writer of the passage intends to try to tell us   _  .,"Moses Mendelssohn, the grandfather of the well-known German composer , was far from being handsome. Along with a rather short stature , he had a hunchback  .
One day he visited a merchant in Hamburg who had a lovely daughter named Frumtje. Moses fell hopelessly in love with her. But Moses was refused by his ugly appearance
When it was time for him to leave, Moses picked up his courage and climbed the stairs to
her room to take one last chance to speak with her. She was a heavenly beauty, but caused him deep sadness by her refusal to look at him. After several attempts at conversation, Moses shyly asked, ""Do you believe marriages are made in heaven?""
""Yes, ""She answered, still looking at the floor. ""And do you?""
""Yes I do, ""He replied. ""You see, in heaven at the birth of each boy, the God announces which
girl he will marry. When I was born, my future bride  was pointed out to me. Then the God added, 'But your wife will be humpbacked. '""""Right then and there I called out, 'Oh God, a humpbacked woman would be a tragedy . Please, God, give me the hump and let her be beautiful. '""
Then Frumtje looked up into his eyes and was stirred by some deep memory. She reached out and gave Mendelssohn her hand and later became his devoted wife.",high7303.txt
