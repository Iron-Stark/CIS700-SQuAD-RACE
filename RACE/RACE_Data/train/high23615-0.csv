0,A,"['when she was just a little child', 'when she was at school four years ago', 'after she was at school four years ago', 'when she began to study in a big hospital']",Alice made up her mind to be a nurse   _  .,"My friend Alice decided to be a nurse when she was four years old. She always to play at ""doctors and nurses"" with her playmates. When she left school last year, she still wanted to be a real nurse. 
Late September she started her studies in a big hospital in Newcastle. She had to work very hard. She went to classes every day and studied late at night. Then a really important day came: her first day in a ward  . At last she was really helping sick people, not just sitting in classes or learning from books. 
At first, student nurses do lots of odd jobs in the ward. They help to serve meals, or wash the patients. They also keep the ward tidy and make the beds. But they cannot give injections or help the doctors. 
One of Alice's first jobs was in a ward of old people. She was told to clean all the patients' false teeth. She collected all the teeth and took them to the bathroom. Instead of cleaning each set of teeth one by one, she put them all into a big bowl. 
""It'll be quicker this way,"" she said to herself. ""Then I can give back everyone's teeth in a few minutes."" 
Give back everyone's teeth! Alice stood in the middle of the ward with her big bowl of teeth. She had no idea which teeth belonged to which old man! You can imagine the confusion  of the next half-hour when each patient came to find his own teeth!",high23615.txt
