1,A,"['six', 'four', 'five', 'two']",How many classes does Henry have on Thursday?,"Dear Annie,
Thank you for your letter. I'm glad you like your school.
I go to school from Monday to Friday. We have four classes in the morning and two classes in the afternoon. We have many things to do after class. On Monday and Wednesday afternoon we do sports. On Tuesday afternoon some of us have a singing class and on Thursday afternoon some have a drawing class. On Friday afternoon, we practice speaking English. My Chinese friends like to talk with me in English. They think I am like an English teacher. Isn't it great?
On Saturdays and Sundays I don't go to school. Very often I go to the parks and have a good time with my family there.
Yours,
Henry",middle988.txt
