""That's very easy,"" said the old man. ""You just need to put on a happy man's shirt and you'll be happy.""
The king believed the old man and began to look for a happy man. He visited many countries and met kings, professors  and others. But they all said they were not happy.
One day he saw a poor farmer working in the field. The farmer was singing all the time and looked very happy. The king came up to him and asked, ""Are you happy, my good man?""

""Can you sell me your shirt?"" asked the king.
""My shirt?"" the farmer answered in surprise. ""But I don't have a shirt. In fact, I never have one.""
