""The idea of a Cancer Chat forum means you can share information about treatment and side effects and you can really open up about your feelings online in a way that can be difficult when talking to close friends and family.And with Cancer Research UK.monitoring the forum people can be guaranteed the quality of information being exchanged.""
Cancer Chat will also encourage its users to check out any cancer questions on its  CancerHelp UK website which is specially designed to give patients and their families 6,000  pages of up-to-date information that is easy to understand and explains a wide range of treatments for different types of cancer and give details of clinical trials.There is also a UK database of cancer clinical trials.
