3,A,"['Because he wants to answer the telephone.', 'Because Kate arrives at home at that time.', 'Because he need to get some more spices.', 'Because he watches a show about cooking on TV.']",What does Mike leave the kitchen for when he is cooking?,"Hi Suzie,
I have a big problem again! You know that I love to cook. Everyone says that I am the next ""celebrity chef"". I never miss favourite cookery shows on TV. I always like to try new recipes. Curry is one of my favourite meals. I love all the spices and that is the problem!
I am in the kitchen when the telephone rings. I answer the phone and chat for five minutes to my friend Kate. I go back to my curry, but I don't remember that the spices are already in and I add more. My curry smells delicious, but when we eat it everyone looks at me. The curry tastes very bad. My mum says, ""Why is it so hot?""
Then I remember about the spices.
I'm off for a hamburger.
Love,
Mike",middle6695.txt
