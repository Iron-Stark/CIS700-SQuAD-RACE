1,D,"['those who help their children take responsibility for their own action', 'Those who find out the important elements of a healthy development', 'those who give advice on how to find their own sense of creativity', 'Those who offer any help whenever their children are in need']","Which of the following are ""helicopter parents"" according to the passage?","There is an agreement that we are depriving   this current generation of young kids a chance to do what they are not only equipped to do,but need to dotake some risks.And we're not talking about unimportant ones,either.Kids need to learn how to handle ""dangerous"" things like power tools,make fires,and have the benefits that occur from ""playing with knives"".
    Hanna Rosin focuses on some of the misguided reasons we are raising ""The Overprotected Kid"" in the Atlantic.She says our concerns with kids' safety go beyond the actual risks.
    I agree with this new opinion. For many kids growing up today,there are fewer and fewer opportunities to practice risk taking.Risk taking is an important skill every kid needs to learn,how to do something that they are a little seared of doing because they haven't done it before.Part of the reason for ""Overprotection"" is certainly the parental fear. This is certainly evident in terms of the physical environment.
    I claim that much of the parental concern isn't driven by.fear of injury--it's more about concern with success.
    ""Play"" may be in fact less dangerous than our structured sports--yet we focus more on the risk because we don't see the benefit.And this broader concern with success is not limited to the playground or sports field.""Overprotection"" certainly happens in the social and academic fields as well,as phrases like ""helicopter parent"" have become mainstream.There is plenty of social and academic risk taking that can also be prevented because of the perception of risk.",high18806.txt
