    ""We have no knowledge of great apes being used in experiments in Spain, but there is currently no law preventing that from happening,"" Poza said.
    Keeping apes for circuses, television commercials or filming will also be forbidden.Housing apes in Spanish zoos, of which there are currently 315, will remain legal, but supporters of  _ have said the conditions in which most of them live will need to improve vastly.
    Philosophers Peter Singer and Paola Cavalieri founded the Great Ape Project in 1993, arguing that ""non-human hominids "" should enjoy the rights to life and freedom and not to be mistreated.",high20692.txt
