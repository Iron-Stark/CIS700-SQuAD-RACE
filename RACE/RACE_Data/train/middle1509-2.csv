2,C,"['Only a few of us will have such experiences,', 'People always forget why they hurry into the kitchen.', ""It doesn't matter if you can't remember why you do a certain thing at times."", 'Have something cold to drink can help you to remember the things.']",Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?,"You hurry into the kitchen,open the refrigerator and suddenly you forget why you open it.""What am I looking for?""You ask yourself.""What am I doing here?""Don't worry.You are not losing your mind.We have all had this kind of thing.If you think about something very quickly,it goes into your short-term memory and it goes right back out in just a few seconds.You have not moved things from short-term to long-term memory,so you won't be able to remember it later on.
What can you do to help get back your missing short-term memory?You may go back to where you were.So,for example,if you were sitting in a chair listening to the music in the living room,just go back into the living room.This will help you remember,and when you are back in the living room,you will suddenly think,""Oh,yes,I was thirsty and I wanted something cold to drink.That is why I went to the fridge.""If,sometimes,you can't go back to where you were before,just try tracing your steps back in your mind.Think back to things you did before,and this may help you.",middle1509.txt
