2,D,"['Because the dentist came at last.', 'Because the assistant kept comforting her.', 'Because she could relax in the chair.', 'Because she saw a picture on the ceiling.']",Why did the author suddenly smile?,"The morning had been a disaster.My tooth was aching,and I'd been in an argument with a friend.Her words still hurt:""The trouble with you is that you won't put yourself in my place.Can't you see things from my point of view?""I shook my head stubbornly--and felt the ache in my tooth.I'd thought I could hold out till my dentist came back from holiday,but the pain was really unbearable.I started calling the dentists in the phone book,but no one could see me immediately.Finally, at about lunchtime,I got lucky.

     When I tole her my fears, she laughed and said ,""Don't worry.The dentist is very good.""

     ""Come on ,he is coming.Just lie down and relax.And enjoy the artwork,""the assistant said.
     ""The artwork?""I was puzzled.

     What a relief!",high18123.txt
