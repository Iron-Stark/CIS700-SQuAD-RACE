0,C,"['Only 16 glasses of water.', 'Less than 16 glasses of water.', 'At least 16 glasses of water.', 'As much as possible.']",How much water do we need in one hot day?,"On a hot day, it can be hard to know what to do to feel good.
Playing in water is one way to feel cooler. Taking a cool bath or a shower can feel really good on a hot day.
It is also important for us to drink water. If you feel thirsty, you should drink water immediately. On hot days, you can lose about 16 glasses of water in one day, so many doctors advise that you should try to drink at least that much every day. Mixing a little fruit juice into your water is a fun way to help you drink plenty of water.
The food we eat also makes a difference in how we feel in the heat. Cold food, such as ice cream and drinks with some ice, can cool down our bodies. However, eating spicy  food makes our bodies even warmer.
The clothes we wear can help us feel cooler as well. Light-coloured, light-weight clothes feel cooler in the sun than dark, heavy clothing. Loose clothes are more comfortable in the heat than tight ones.
Even though it is not healthy to run around during the hottest time of the day, that doesn't mean a hot day is not fun! You can read stories in your room. You can also paint or draw without moving your body too much. These are just some of many cool things to do on a hot day.",middle5453.txt
