2,A,"['Ways to stay away from phubbing', 'People who are addicted to phubbing', 'Possible reasons for phubbing', 'Advice on how to use a cell phone']",What may the passage talk about next?,"Don't you hate it when someone snubs you by looking at their phone instead of paying  attention? The word ""Phubbing"", which comes from ""phone"" and ""snub"", describes such behavior . With popularization of smart phones, we see a new ""Phubbing"" group everywhere in public places: in subway, restaurants, roads, people are checking the mobile phone, ignoring the people around completely. What is worrying us is that not only young people, but also the elderly and kids are getting addicted to Phubbing.
On Dec 29th, a 28-year-old woman--a mother of two in Wenzhou, drowned after she fell into a river while looking at her mobile phone. A Pakistani man was killed on Dec 15th, 2015, after being hit by a fast moving train while trying to take a selfie  with it on the track. Last month, Justin, a college student was shot in subway in San Francisco, the U.S. The surveillance video showed that before Justin was killed, the killer pulled out the gun several times, and even wiped his nose with it. However, nobody noticed that. The surrounding passengers all focused on their cell phones.
Phone is the tool for communication, but now it distances people and makes them separated from each other. Therefore, someone jokes ""the furthest distance in the world is not the distance between life and death, but that you don't know I stand in front of you while you focus on the mobile.""
Phubbing appears harmless; however, it does affect our life. 23-year-old Alex from Melbourne wrote in his blog: ""I can no longer focus on what I am eating since I started twittering. My skill of food photography has improved very fast, while my interest in food drops a lot as a result.""",high13744.txt
