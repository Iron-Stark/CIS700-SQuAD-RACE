3,C,"['was attempting the impossible', 'was trying to set a world record', 'was following the trail of Lewis and Clark', 'was fighting with weather and taking unnecessary risks']",We can infer from the text that when crossing the Lolo Pass the author  _  .,"Grey clouds move as low as smoke over the treetops at Lolo Pass. The ground is white. The day is June 10.It has been snowing for the past four days in the Bitterroot Mountains.Wayne Fairchild is getting worried about our trek over the Lolo Trail-95 miles from Lolo Montana to Weippe in Idaho, across the roughest country in the West. Lewis and Clark were nearly defeated 200 years ago by snowstorms on the Lolo.Today Fairchild is nervously checking the weather reports.He has agreed to take me across the toughest,middle section of the trail.
