3,C,"['My friend.', 'Trust is the most important.', 'Opinions about a good friends.', 'Being generous is the important.']",What's the best title of the passage?,"Cindy, Jerry and Mary are giving their opinions about a good friend.
Cindy: I think a good friend should be honest . That's more important than any other thing and is where a good friendship starts. _ 
Jerry: I think a good friend has to be generous. Here ""generous"" doesn't mean he has to give his friends his lunch money or his clothes. It means he should share  his ideas and feelings with his friends. In fact, his friends can know him better in this way.
Mary: In my opinion a good friend should understand  his friends. When there's something wrong between him and his friends, he must put himself in his friends' place and think more for his friends.",middle1840.txt
