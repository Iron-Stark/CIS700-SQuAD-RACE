2,D,"['following their brothers', 'following their  s', ""following their fathers' advice"", 'following TV shows']",Young male shoppers make their choices   _  .,"""Regardless of social class, race, age, men say they hate to shop,"" says Zukin, City University of New York sociology professor. "" Yet when you ask them deeper questions, it turns out that they like to shop. Men generally like to shop for books , music and hardware. But if you ask them about the shopping they do for books or music, they'll say, ' Well , that's not shopping. That's research .'""
       In other words, what men and women call ""buying things"" and how they approach that task are different. 
       Women will wander through several 1,000-square-meter stores in search of the perfect party dress. Men will wander through 100 Internet sites in search of the perfect digital camcorder. 
       Women see shopping as a social event. Men see it as a special task or a game to be won. 
       ""Men are frequently shopping to win,"" says Ann, a marketing professor at Loyola University of Chicago. ""They want to get the best deal. They want to get the best one, the latest one and if they manage to do that it makes them happy."" 
       ""When women shop, they're doing it in a way that they want everybody to be very happy,"" says Ann. ""They're kind of shopping for love.""
       ""Teenage girls learn to shop from their moms and older sisters, but they also learn to shop by examining articles in magazines like Seventeen."" Zukin says. 
       ""And although men's magazines such as GQand Esquire have long had shopping articles, it's TV that has the eye of young male shoppers,"" says Ann and Zukin. 
       ""Of course, there are men who love to shop and are proud of it,"" Loyola's Ann says. 
       And that is important no matter whether you buy a car or a frying pan. All men love to buy but they don't want to be cheated. 
       Ann adds, ""There actually are men who are interested, for example, in cooking or shopping or chinaware or things around their homes--they become kind of girl magnets. Women like it. """,high21290.txt
