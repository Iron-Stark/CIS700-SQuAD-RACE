0,B,"['2', '3', '4', '5']",How many tips does the passage mention ?,"China's air pollution problems are more serious these days. But just try to remember that the air pollution shouldn't stop you from enjoying life in China. Here are some tips for you to keep the smog away.
Watch the weather report.
As you can see, it will give you an _ of pollution, but my general rule is: if it's above 80, wear a face mask and limit time to spend outside; if it's below 80, go outside and enjoy the day, open all the windows to get some much-needed fresh air and exercise. But do not exercise outside if the pollution is high. I went running once when it was around 120, and I was ill and missed several days of work.
Get a house plant that cleans the air.
A house plant can make your home beautiful and clean the air. I have some plants and just yesterday, I bought another plant. At that time I didn't know it could clean the air. I just got it because it could make me feel better.
Never open the windows.
No matter how hot and wet it is inside, just wait until it is a nice day to air your apartment. Just stay at home and do some things you like.",middle7857.txt
