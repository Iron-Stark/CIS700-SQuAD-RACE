2,C,"['They decided to open a store', 'Thev wanted to save money', ""They couldn't afrord expensive things"", 'They wanted to buy gifts for local kids']",Why would the Hatches routinely go from store to store?,"A year ago August, Dave Fuss lost his job driving a truck for a small company in west Michigan.His wife,Gerrie,was still working in the local school cafeteria,but work for Dave was scarce,and the price of everything was rising.The Fusses were at risk of joining the millions of Americans who have lost their homes in recent years.Then Dave and Gerrie received a timely gift-$7,000,a legacy from their neighbors Ish and Arlene Hatch,who died in an accident.""It really made a difference when we were going under financially.''says Dave.
    But the Fusses weren't the only folks in Alto and the neighboring town of Lowell to receive unexpected legacy from the Hatches.Dozens of other families were touched by the Hatches'generosity.In some cases,it was a few thousand dollars;in other, it was more than $100,000.
    It surprised nearly everyone that the Hatches had so much money, more than $ 3 milliorr-they were an elderly couple who lived in an old house on what was left of the family farm.
    Children of the Great Depression,Ish and Arlene were known for their habit of saving. They thrived on comparison shopping and would routinely go from store to store,checking prices before making a new purchase.
    Through the years,the Hatches paid for local children to attend summer camp when their Darents couldn't afford it.""Ish and Arlene never asked if you needed anything,""says their friend Sand Van Weelden,""They could see things they could do to make you happier, and they would do them.
    Even more extraordinary was that the Hatches had their farmland distributed.It was the Hatches' wish that their legacy-a legacy of kindness as much as one of dollars and cents----should enrich the whole community and last for generations to come.
    Neighbors helping neighbors----hat was Ish and Arlene Hatch's story.",high18278.txt
