They can play any time they like because they don't go to school. Instead, they are educated at home by their parents, Paul and Veronika Robinson. But they don't have lessons, have never used a timetable and learn only what and when they want to learn.
""I want my kids to have freedom in their childhood, not spend it in an institution,"" says 37-year-old Veronika, ""School is all about control and following the rules."" Veronika and her 56-year-old husband Paul have never experienced the daily rush to get dressed and out of the door that is common in most households with school-aged children. ""We get up at our leisure - usually around 8:30,"" says Veronika. ""We might visit a friend, or go to the library, and on Tuesdays we shop at the market. In summer, we spend most of our time outside and the girls entertain themselves a lot.""
New research due to be published this spring reveals a very different picture of Britain's home educators. ""Out of 297 families, 184 said that they never use a timetable,"" says Mike Fortune-Wood of Home Education UK. ""Ninety per cent never or rarely use textbooks, and nearly all said that happiness, contentment and self-fulfillment were more important than academic achievement. Only 15% felt that planning what to learn was important.""
So far, so good. But what, you might ask, are the children actually learning?
""It wasn't important to me that the girls could read by a certain age, but they both picked it up for themselves at around seven,"" says Robinson. ""Weighing cooking ingredients uses maths, and making a shopping list teaches them to write. Observing five hens has taught the girls about survival of the fittest. ""
But what about when the children grow up? Can they go to university? The home educators' answer is they can if they want to. There are a variety of routes into higher education, but probably the most common is to join a local college. This is what Gus Harris-Reid has done. ""I was educated at home all my life. I'd never had a lesson or been inside a classroom until I started GCSEs,"" says the 18-year-old. ""I'm now studying for 4 A-levels at Exeter College. I've had no problem with the work or with fitting in."" When asked to reflect on his experience of home education, his considered response is, ""Like a permanent holiday, really!"" Not a bad start for someone who plans to take a mechanical engineering degree next year.",high16799.txt
