0,A,"['copy', 'mountain village', 'terrible accident', 'the heroes of Liangshan']",Shanzhai means    _    today.,"The word ""shanzhai"" originally means ""mountain village"",but it means""copy""in Chinese now.
I started to research this topic and found a whole new shanzhai world.There are shanzhai  products  and online games,even shanzhai culture.It is so popular that some people say to each other ""have you shanzhaied today""?Like it or not,shanzhai has become part of our life in China.
I even met a famous engineer recently who has just had his shanzhai mobile phone.He was so proud of it and would not stop talking about all the functions while showing off the look of his phone.I could hardly see the back cover as he had stuck fake logos ""iPhone"",""No-kia""&""LG""on it.
But why has shanzhai become so popular in China? Why do over 50 percent of the people surveyed by CCTV support it? Firstly,many may not realize it but for Chinese people,the word
""shanzhai"" also reminds us of"" the heroes of Liangshan"".Secondly, there would be no shanzhai without the Internet.Shanzhai has caught the interest of millions of Chinese online.
There are also shanzhai celebrities.Many shanzhai singers can be seen performing in some
places where people cannot see performances by the actual""real""stars.These events are very successful,even though people know that they are not getting the""real""thing.",middle8099.txt
