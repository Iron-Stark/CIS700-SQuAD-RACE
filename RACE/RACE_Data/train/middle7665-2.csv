2,C,"['Because he is Chinese.', ""Because he didn't like to be a student of our class."", 'Because our appearances frightened him too much.', 'Because he was ill.']",Why did the student cry out when he came into our classroom for the first time?,"There is a student from China in our class. He is very good at his lessons, but he is also very shy. He doesn't talk too much with us because he thinks that there are so many differences. When he came into our classroom for the first time, he was so frightened   that he cried out.
That's because of our appearances. For example, his hair is short, black and straight, but ours are all different from his. Jim's hair is yellow and much longer than his. Dave's hair is curly and brown. Kitty's hair is blonde. Our builds and clothes seem to be strange in his eyes,too. Peter is a boy. He is tall and thin, but he wears a colorful T-shirt.",middle7665.txt
