1,B,"['with the help of her teachers', 'by researching on other websites', 'in order to please her principal', 'to make her school more famous']",Sarah set up the new school website   _  .,"This is an interview between the reporter and Sarah, a girl who created a website  for her school.
Reporter: Why did you start this new website for Alcott Middle School?
Sarah: Three months ago, my mom was complaining about how she never hears about the days our school ends early until after the fact. She works late and sometimes she has to ask our neighbor at the last minute to pick me up after school. It happened several times, and she was frustrated that there wasn't better notification   from the school.
Reporter: Didn't your school already have a website with that information?
Sarah: We had a website. But there wasn't much information on it, and nobody was _ keeping it up-to-date  . I asked my teacher if our class could update the school calendar. That seemed pretty easy.
Reporter: Was it?
Sarah: Yeah, and it was kind of fun. So then we asked the principal   if we could redo the whole site. He said okay, so we went to work. We discovered websites that taught us how to make our site look better and added more hot links that people could click to get more information about a subject. We posted photos from basketball games. Our class even started a blog about what's going on at school. Then we persuaded the teachers to create their own pages.
Reporter: So what's next?
Sarah: A few friends and I started a small Web design business. We're asking other schools if they'll employ us to set up a site like the one we created.
Reporter: Wow! That's pretty enterprising   for a 13-year-old.
Sarah: I guess so. But it doesn't seem like work when you're doing something you enjoy.",high13900.txt
