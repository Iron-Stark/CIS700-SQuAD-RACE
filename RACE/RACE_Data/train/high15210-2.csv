2,D,"[""Mother's Club in China."", 'BabyCare and Doctors.', 'American Company Model.', 'Educational Toys in China']",Which of the following would be the most suitable title for the passage?,"BEUING (Associated Press ) --China has a growing middle class, a tradition of expecting education and 21 million new babies every year. Selling educational toys should be easy.
While China may be the world's biggest toymaker, many of the best are exported . Department stores here do not have enough high quality toys. It is said that the demand for educational toys is low.
A US company, BabyCare, is trying to change that with a new way to sell toys in China.
BabyCare works basically together with doctors in Beijing hospitals.  People who join the company's ""mother club""can get lectures and newsletters on baby and child development at no extra cost, if they agree to spend 18 dollars a month on the company's educational toys and childcare books.
""We want to build a sevenyear relationship with those people,"" said Matthew J. Estes, BabyCare's president. ""It starts during pregnancy , when the anxiety and needs are highest."" BabyCare works on a onetoone basis. Doctors, nurses, and teachers paid by BabyCare advise parents, explain toys that are designed for children at each stage of development to age six.
BabyCare opened its first store in China last June in a shopping center in central Beijing and another near Beijing Zoo. It plans to have 80 stores in China within six years.
It is a new model for China and develops a market in young children's education and health that no other companies are in.",high15210.txt
