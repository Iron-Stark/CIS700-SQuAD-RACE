1,D,"['At 4:00 a.m.', 'At 4:00 p.m.', 'At 5:00 a.m.', 'At 5:00 p.m.']",When did Mrs. Jackson's friends leave her house?,"Mrs. Jackson was a rich woman. She had many friends. She liked cooking very much and she often invited her friends to her big house.
One day, she invited some of her friends to lunch. She wanted very much to try a new way of cooking a fish, and she was very pleased with herself when the dish was ready. The fish was very hot, so she put it near the open window to make it cool. But five minutes later, when she came back for it, she was surprised to see her neighbor's cat, Mike, eating the fish. She was in time to stop the cat before it was too late. That afternoon everything was good and all her friends liked the fish very much. They talked until four o'clock. Then they said goodbye and left.
At the end of that afternoon, when she was alone again, Mrs. Jackson was very tired but happy. She was sitting in the chair just near the window. Then through the window, she was surprised to see her neighbor's cat dead in the garden! Why, the fish must be bad! What would happen to her friends? She telephoned her family doctor at once. The doctor told her to call each of her friends to see him at the hospital. At last, the danger was over.
Once again, Mrs. Jackson was alone in her chair in the sitting-room, still tired but no longer happy. Just then the telephone rang. It was her neighbor. ""Oh, Mrs. Jackson, Mike is dead. He was killed by a car and put in your garden..."".
