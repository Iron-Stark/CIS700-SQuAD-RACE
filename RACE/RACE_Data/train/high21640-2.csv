2,C,"['The child is over 16.', 'The child is in education.', 'The child is one of the top students', 'The annual income is less that PS30,810.']","The following are requirements for a family to apply for EMA, except  _  .","Is education compulsory after age 16?
Under the present law, the school leaving age is 16. After 2013 the education leaving age will rise to 17. And from 2015 it will rise again, to 18.
The government is raising the leaving age because research shows that young people who carry on learning or training until the age of 18 earn more money, are likely to be healthier and less likely to be in trouble with the police.
So although at the moment your child can leave education once they're 16, it's worth thinking carefully about the benefits of carrying on.
What options are available after 16?
Education after16 doesn't just mean staying at school full-time: your child can stay at school, go to college, or take up an apprenticeship or a part-time training course. They can earn money and learn new skills at the same time if they want to.
The main qualifications available are:
Diplomas: providing the background for a range of careers
Vocational qualifications: for young people who already know what career they want to follow and need training for specific jobs
A levels: offered as specific mainly academic subjects
International Baccalaureate: offering a wider range of subjects than A levels
What financial help is available?
If your child continues in education after 16 and your household income is less than PS30,810 a year, your child should be eligible  for up to PS30 a week to help with their costs. It won't affect any benefits you get as an individual or as a family, and the money will be paid directly into your child's bank account. This money is known as Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA).",high21640.txt
