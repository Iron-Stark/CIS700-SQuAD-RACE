2,C,"[""the farmer didn't know the way, either"", 'the farmer is busy working in the field', 'The city man asked the question rudely', ""the farmer can't speak clearly""]",The farmer didn't tell the city man the way to the next town because   _   .,"A man from a big city with a new cart and a beautiful pair of horses was driving along a country road . He did not give much attention to where he was going. Very soon he knew he lost his way, but he kept on driving hoping he would meet someone or find his way back.
It was a long way. For many hours he kept on driving. When it was almost dark he saw a farmer who was working in a field. He stopped and shouted, ""Hello, farmer!"" ""Hello, yourself!"" the farmer answered, still working.
""Where does this road go?""
""I have never seen it go anywhere. It always stays where it is."" said the farmer, without stopping his work.
""How far is it to the next town?"" said the stranger, with a little louder voice.
""I don't know. I've never measured   it ."" Answered the farmer.
By the time the city man was getting angry. ""What do you know? You're the biggest fool I've seen.""
The farmer stopped and turned and looked for a while at the man. Then he said, ""Maybe I do not know much, perhaps I'm a fool. But at least I'm not lost.""",middle4986.txt
