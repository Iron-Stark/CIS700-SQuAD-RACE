As we age it becomes harder to keep our muscles healthy. They get smaller, which reduces strength and increases the possibility of falls and fractures  . New research is showing how this happens and what to do about it.
A team of Nottingham researchers has already shown that when older people eat, they cannot make muscle as fast as the young. Now they've found that the ability to prevent muscle breakdown is reduced with age.
When older people eat, they don't build enough muscle with the protein in food; also, the insulin   fails to shut down the muscle breakdown that rises between meals and overnight. Normally, in young people, insulin acts to slow muscle breakdown.
The research just published compared one group of people in their late 60s to a group of 25-year-olds, with equal numbers of men and women. ""We studied our subjects first -- before breakfast -- and then after giving them a small amount of insulin to raise the hormone  to what they would be if they had eaten breakfast,"" Professor Rennie said.
"" The results were clear. The younger people's muscles were able to use insulin we gave to stop the muscle breakdown, which had increased during the night. The muscles in the older people could not. In the course of our tests, we also noticed that the blood flow in the leg was greater in the younger people than the older ones,"" added Professor Rennie. 
However, scientists think that weight training may reactivate muscle blood flow and help retain   muscles for older people. ""In fact, doing exercise three times a week over 20 weeks reactivates the leg blood flow responses of older people. They became identical to those in the young,"" said Professor Rennie.",high22165.txt
