When Kathy and Victor reached the edge of the grassland, flames were shooting more than five meters into the air.
Kathy couldn't believe what she was seeing. One glance told her they needed medical attention immediately. She questioned Justin, "" Is there anyone in the plane?""
""No,"" he said.
""Where are you able to radio for help?""
""There was no time.""
"" I'm a distance runner."" Kathy said, ""I'll go for help."" Looking at the seriously injured men, she said, ""It may take me several hours to get out."" She started out.
When she was 23, Kathy set a women's-course record in a Marathon. She had run 42 kilometers. But now she was running the race of her life. She had nearly 30 kilometers of hard wilderness to cover to get help.
Kathy had been running for two hours. This was far back into the wilderness. The trail  grew unclear. She stopped to take a quick compass  reading. She had run for more than 20 kilometers. Her heart fell, her muscle  aching. Finally she saw her car in the distance.
