2,A,"['The Gift of Life', 'A Cold Dark Day', ""Suzie's Death"", 'My Friend Suzie']",Which is the best title for the passage?,"It was a hot summer day. My dad and I were getting ready to go out for a ride on the boat. Just then the phone call came, the call changed that sunny and beautiful day into a cold and dark one.
When I saw my father answering the phone, he was crying. I'd never seen my dad cry before. My heart sank. What possibly could happen?
""Max, I'm so sorry,"" I heard him say. That's when it hit me. I knew that Suzie had died.
Max has been my dad's best friend for years. Suzie, his daughter, had a serious illness. She knew she was different from other kids. Although she couldn't live a normal life, she was still happy.
When Suzie and I were little girls, we spent quite a bit of time together. When Suzie was ten, she had to live in a hospital. About eight months before she died, we talked at least twice a week on the phone until the end. Suzie was always so excited to talk to me and wanted to know everything I did and every thing I ate.
When Suzie and I first started calling each other, I thought _ would be more of a burden on me, but I was completely wrong. I learned so much from her. She gave me more than I could ever give her. I will never forget her or the talks we had. I now know that I must never take anything for granted, especially my health and the gift of life.",middle1888.txt
