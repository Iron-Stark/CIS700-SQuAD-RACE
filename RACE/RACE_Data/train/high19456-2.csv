2,C,"['It lies in the city of Bradford, UK.', 'It is too cold for people to live in.', 'It requires to be built every year.', 'It is built between January and April.']",What do we know about the Snow Castle?,"Jamie Wardley is a special kind of artist - an ice sculptor. He first trained as a sand sculptor. Later, he learned about ice sculpture. Now he does sand sculpture in the summer. And in the winter, he sculpts ice.
When sculpting ice, Wardley has to work in cold temperatures. If the weather is cold enough, he can work outside. But winter in the United Kingdom is not always very cold. So often he works in a large freezer where the temperature is about -12degC.
Wardley enjoys sculpting ice outside in the winter. When he sculpts in the open air, people can watch. They can be part of the creative process.
Wardley makes ice sculpting sound simple. But the tools Wardley uses are sharp and dangerous. And the ice is very heavy. Each block of ice weighs 120 kilos. And some larger sculptures are made from several combined blocks of ice. Sometimes ice sculptures can be as big as buildings. In Kemi, Finland there is an ice hotel called the Snow Castle. Each year, Wardley helps build the Snow Castle.
Inside the Snow Castle, the temperature is -50C. Even the dining tables are made of ice. So you have to wear winter clothes when eating and wear a hat when sleeping. ""The ice hotel is built every year in January. Then it melts in April. Each year we rebuild it and create a new design,"" Wardley said.
The Snow Castle is a large and amazing work of ice, but Wardley's smaller ice sculptures are special too. One winter, in the city of Bradford, UK, Wardley created several small sculptures.  He used the sculptures to tell a story which contained an important message about good will and understanding.
Ice sculptures are temporary works of art. When the temperature rises, they will melt. But that does not mean that their beauty is lost. The sculptures from that day in Bradford have now melted away, but their message of good will, understanding, and acceptance remains.",high19456.txt
