2,C,"['frighten the driver', 'hid from its owner', 'make itself warm and unseen', 'find something delicious to eat']",The snake crawled on the top of the car probably to,"A woman in Santa Fe, New Mexico, left her home early to go to work on a Thursday morning, but after twenty minutes' drive her car suddenly broke down. Fortunately, at that moment, a kind man named Jackson Auk coming, helped her pull the car over, but when he opened the hood   of the car he didn't find a dead battery. Instead, he found a living snake, 9 - foot, 20 - pound, ""It was looking right at me. It flicked its little tongue, and I was a little frightened ""Jackson Ault said.
So Ault and the woman called the local police to get help. The first officer on the scene didn't know how to control the snake like most people and was not brave at that moment. But then the police - Lt. Louis Carlos showed up and the story suddenly became much less frightening and more delightful.
""Cool, I wanted to hold it!"" Carlos told a local TV reporter about his reaction to seeing the snake. ""It was easy for me to go there, pick it up, hold it and let the snake feel the warmth of my hands and my body.""
After comforting the snake, Carlos called Animals Control Service, which brought the snake to the Santa Fe Animal Shelter. 
One people from the center said the snake was not dangerous and it was like a pet that wanted to escape from its owner's home. It was also just a baby, only halfway toward her estimated adult length. They said it almost certainly crawled on the top of the car's engine to seek warmth and shelter.
""We had a lot of fun with it today - everyone there wanted to challenge their courage and handle the snake,"" people could read these words on the Santa Fe Animal Shelter's Facebook page. 
In fact, not everyone thought that way. ""I was hesitant to open my own hood even though that sounds ridiculous,"" Ault said.",high18960.txt
