Do you like to study in the living room? This is not a good place because it is usually too noisy. You need to study in a quiet place, like your bedroom. A quiet place will help you only think about one thing. When you study, don,t think about other things at the same time. Only think about your homework. If you do so, you will do your homework more quickly , and you will make fewer mistakes.
