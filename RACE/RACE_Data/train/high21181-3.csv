3,C,"['China Fights AIDS', 'Young People--Most likely AIDS Victims', 'AIDS Information Is Necessary', 'AIDS--A Deadly Disease']",What is the best title of this passage?,"It is now commonly known that AIDS is a deadly disease. It does great damage to human beings' immune system, weakening resistance to disease and leading to death due to utter weakness. To this day, there are no existing drugs that can kill AIDS virus. It is a deadly battle between science and AIDS.
This is only one side of the story. Although it can not be cured, AIDS is preventable. For those who have not caught the disease, the knowledge of preventive measures seems to be the most powerful weapon at hand.
Since the discovery of the first AIDS patient in 1985, the number of HIV carriers is on an alarming rise in China and statistics show that young people are the more likely victims of AIDS. Nationwide there are 214 million people between the ages of 13 and 22, most of whom are students. If no measures are taken to protect these young people, it is almost certain that the threat of AIDS will be very real to them. There has been a great deal of misinformation concerning the transmission of AIDS.
One of the most misleading myths is that AIDS can be transmitted by casual physical contact such as kissing, shaking hands or sharing food container. Surveys and investigations conducted in some universities and colleges show that half of those people questioned are not clear about how AIDS is transmitted, not to mention how it is prevented.
This is the driving force behind the State Education Department's decision to spread AIDS awareness information among college students and later to high school students and primary school students.",high21181.txt
