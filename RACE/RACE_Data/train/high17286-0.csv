   The police can only do so much to prevent crime. There never can be enough of them to guard every home in every town. So they need your help in fighting with the burglars,the vandals , and the car thieves.
   Not, of course, by setting out to have a go every time you see something suspicious. It'll always be the job of the police to arrest criminals.
   But by acting as a line of communication between them and your community, for instance, you probably know far more about your immediate neighborhoods than the police ever could.
   A stranger in someone's garden would probably be far more obvious to you than it would to even the local police, if, of course, you were on the look-out.
That's the whole idea behind the Neighborhood Watch schemes, springing up around the country to create a spirit of watchfulness within a community, anything suspicious being reported to the police.
   It's early days yet, but results so far are very encouraging. The crime figures are already dropping in many of the areas running the scheme. And all due to people like you.",high17286.txt
