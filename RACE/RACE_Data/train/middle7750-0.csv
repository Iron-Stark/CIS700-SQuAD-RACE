0,A,"['leg', 'head', 'foot', 'trunk']",The first man touched the elephant's   _  .,"One day, five blind men were walking along, when suddenly they bumped into something very big in front of them. Each one put out his hand and _ it. The first man thought it was a tree ---it was tall and round. The second man felt something tall and wide and rough  and said, ""Aha! This must be a wall !"" The third man touched a very long smooth thing. He guessed this was a spear  .Then the fourth man said, ""I feel cool. There must be a fan up there. Oh, yes! Here it is!"" He touched something big and round that was moving. What did the fifth man find? Well, he started shouting that he was being chased  by a snake.
