1,B,"[""Jim's."", ""Dave's."", ""Kitty's."", ""Peter's.""]",Whose hair is curly?,"There is a student from China in our class. He is very good at his lessons, but he is also very shy. He doesn't talk too much with us because he thinks that there are so many differences. When he came into our classroom for the first time, he was so frightened   that he cried out.
That's because of our appearances. For example, his hair is short, black and straight, but ours are all different from his. Jim's hair is yellow and much longer than his. Dave's hair is curly and brown. Kitty's hair is blonde. Our builds and clothes seem to be strange in his eyes,too. Peter is a boy. He is tall and thin, but he wears a colorful T-shirt.",middle7665.txt
