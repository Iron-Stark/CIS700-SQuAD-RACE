3,A,"['a new community spirit is growing', 'old people are no longer frightened of crime', 'members of the ""Watch"" look after old people', 'different kinds of people are attracted to live in the area']","Another benefit of the ""Watch"" schemes is that   _  .","The ""Neighborhood Watch"" scheme all started a few years ago in the quiet village of Mollington after a number of burglaries in the village and the surrounding area. The villagers came up with the idea that they themselves could keep an eye on their neighbors' possessions while they were away on holiday. Since then, and with the support of the government and police, more than 50,000 ""Neighborhood Watch"" schemes have been set up all over the country.
The object of each ""Watch"" group is to reduce the opportunities that criminals have in any particular street or area. Each villager who is a member of the scheme will call the police whenever they see something suspicious. It is the police who actually check out each report and look into what is happening. Villagers who are part of the ""Watch"" are not supposed to act as police or put themselves in danger.
When a new ""Neighborhood Watch"" scheme is set up in an area, one benefit is that most burglars dare not take a chance on breaking into someone's house because they know that there is a high risk of being seen by neighbors keeping a lookout. Burglars also know that people are more likely to have fitted good locks to their doors and windows.
Another benefit is that, since the ""Neighborhood Watch"" schemes came into existence, there is growing evidence of a new community spirit. It is bringing people together as never before, and encouraging people to care for each other. New friendships are being made, and contact is often established with old people living on their own, who are often the most frightened and the most at risk.",high22673.txt
