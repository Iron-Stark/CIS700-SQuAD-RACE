2,B,"['the jockey had once bought a horse from another stranger', 'Mr. Jefferson was very good at riding a horse', 'Mr. Jefferson would invite the jockey to his own house later', 'the jockey would not talk about this experience to others']",We can infer from the passage that   _  .,"Riding was the favourite activity of Thomas Jefferson, who was the third President of the United States. He usually rode good horses.
One day, he was riding outside Washington, when a jockey   came near. He did not know the President, but his professional eye was attracted by Mr. Jefferson's horse. He stopped and said that he wanted to buy the horse, but Mr. Jefferson politely refused his offer.
The jockey offered more money for the horse, because the closer he looked at the horse, the more he liked it. All of his offers were refused, which made him angry. He then became rude, but his rudeness left as little an impression as his money, for Jefferson had a very good temper. At last, he hit Mr. Jefferson's horse with his whip, getting it to run suddenly. This would have thrown a less skillful rider to the ground, but Jefferson stayed on his seat, and controlled his horse well.
The jockey then gave up. He rode with Mr. Jefferson side by side and began to talk with him about politics. Jefferson joined in the conversation. When they got into the city and came close to the gate of the presidential mansion  , Mr. Jefferson stopped, and politely invited the man to enter.
The jockey was surprised and asked, ""Why? Do you live here?""
""Yes"" was the simple reply.
""Why, stranger, what's your name?""
""My name is Thomas Jefferson.""
Embarrassed, the man quickly left, while the President looked at him with a smile and then rode through the gate.",high15153.txt
