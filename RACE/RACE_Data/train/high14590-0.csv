The man, Bill Wild, checked into a hotel last night, telling the clerk he would pay cash in advance and would be staying for four nights. He then asked her where the nearest store was and she told him it was John-Johns.
Wild went to the store and bought three gallons of honey and four gallons of chocolate syrup  . The cashier asked him why he wanted these things and he replied, ""I'm trying to become a sweeter person."" The cashier smiled at the joke. Wild drove back to the hotel. He opened all bottles and poured them into the bathtub  . He added warm water to the mix. He tuned the radio to an opera music station, took off his clothes, jumped into the tub, and started singing loudly with the music.
