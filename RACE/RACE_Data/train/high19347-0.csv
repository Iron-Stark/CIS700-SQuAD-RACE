0,A,"['Selling greeting cards.', 'Collecting greeting cards.', 'Buying greeting cards.', 'Sending greeting cards.']",Why was the kit sent for?,"When I was nine years old I lived in a small town. I found an ad for selling greeting cards in the back of a children's magazine. I thought to myself I could do this. I begged my mother to let me send for the kit  . Two weeks later the kit arrived. The next three hours later, I returned home with no card and a pocket full of money shouting, ""Mama, all the people couldn't wait to buy my cards!"" A salesperson was born.
When I was twelve years old, my father took me to see Zig Ziegler. I remember sitting in the dark hall listening to Mr. Ziegler raise everyone's spirits up to ceiling. I left there feeling like I could do anything. When we got to the car, I turned to my father and said, ""Dad, I want to make people feel like that."" My father asked me what I meant. ""I want to be a motivational speaker just like Mr. Ziegler,"" I replied. A dream was born.
Recently, I began pursuing my dream of motivating(inspire) others. I realized that everything I had accomplished -- the graduate degree, the successful sales career, speaking appointments, training and managing for a major fortune 100 company as a senior manager-- had prepared me for this moment. I told my boss who was a great leader I would leave the company though I might not reach such a height in career. He told me to proceed and he believed I would succeed.
Having made that decision, I was immediately tested. One week after I gave notice, my husband was laid off from his job. We had recently bought a new home and needed both incomes to make the monthly mortgage   payment and now we were done to no income. I even planned to turn back to my former company, knowing they wanted me to stay but I was certain that if I went back, I would never leave. I decided I still wanted to move forward rather than end up with a mouth full of ""if onlys"" later on. A motivational speaker was born.
When I held fast to my dream, even during the tough times, the miracles really began to happen. In a short time period my husband found a better job. We didn't miss a mortgage payment. And I was able to book several speaking appointments with new clients  . I discovered the incredible power of dreams. I loved my old job, my workmates and the company I left, but it was time to get on with my dream. To celebrate my success I had a local artist paint my new office as a garden. At the top of one wall she marked, ""The world always makes way for the dreamer.""",high19347.txt
