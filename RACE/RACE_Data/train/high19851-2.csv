2,C,"['Stubborn but brave.', 'Impolite and dishonest.', 'Cautious and brave.', 'Generous but dishonest.']",Which of the following can best describe the author?,"I was in Houston a few weeks ago,and needed to be back home in Austin by midmorning the next day.Though I usually left in the evening,for some reason last time I had to choose to set off after midnight.
I was on my way back to Austin when I realized I left an important file,and knew I had to return to get it.I took the first exit I could,but when I rounded the corner,an 18-wheeler was stopped dead in the exit lane.I swerved  to avoid it,and then I realized that there was something wrong with my car.So I pulled into a small parking lot and unsurprisingly found the area deserted at 3:15am.I've lived in urban areas most of my life.I'm fairly street-wise and don't become frightened easily,but I knew I was in a pretty tough neighborhood.
There was no one in Houston to pick me up.I immediately locked the doors and picked up my phone to call a tow truck.Soon a young man knocked on my driver's side window and asked if he could help me.Judging from his appearance,he was far from a mad man,but I knew he was far more likely to rob than help me.So I lied to him.After a while,he asked again,but this time I politely refused and told him the tow truck was due any minute.He finally said,""Madam,you need help.A tow truck in Houston will arrive anywhere between 45minutes and approximately never (which I knew was true),and you aren't going anywhere until you change your flat tire.""
After considering thoroughly,I got out.He looked surprised,but got right to work.He changed the tire,returned the seat to its place and said,""Thank you for letting me help you.You gave me a chance when most people would never open the door to someone like me.Would it be okay if I gave you a hug?""When I recovered,I gave him a giant hug.I left with a new tire and a renewed faith in human nature.",high19851.txt
