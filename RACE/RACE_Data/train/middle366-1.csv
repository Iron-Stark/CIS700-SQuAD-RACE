1,C,"['Of medium height.', 'Very tall.', 'Very short.', 'Very thin.']",What does adwarf look like?,"I was shopping in the supermarket when I heard a young voice.""Mom,come here!There's this lady here my size!""
The mother rushed to her son;then she turned to me to say sorry to me.
I smiled and told her,""It's OK.""Then I talked to the boy,""Hi,I'm Dory Kramer. How are you?""
He studied me from head to toe,and asked,""Are you a little mommy?""
""Yes,I have a son,"" I answered.
""Why are you so little?""he asked.
""It's the way I was born,"" I said.""Some people are little. Some are tall. I'm just not going to grow any bigger.""After I answered his other questions,I shook the boy's hand and left.
My life as a little person is filled with stories like that. I enjoy talking to children and explaining why I look different from their parents.
It takes only one glance( ) to see I'm different. I stand three feet nine inches tall(=""1.14"" metres).I was born adwarf.In spite of this,I did all the things other kids did when I was growing up.
I didn't realize how short I was until I started school. Some kids called me names  .Then I knew. I began to hate the first day of school each year.
But I learned to smile and face the fact that I was going to be noticed my whole life.What I lacked in height,I made up for in personality.When people are rude,I remind myself,""Look what else I have-a great family,nice friends.""",middle366.txt
