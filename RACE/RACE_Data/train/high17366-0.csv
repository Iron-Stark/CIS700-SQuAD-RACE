    Built in the centre of a forest,Greenwood is a great place to stay whatever the weather is like, Its main attraction for families is the indoor World of Water,where young and old Can have fun in the different pools.Some of these,however,are for serious swimmers only.
    For sporty, people,the Country Club offers tennis,squash and badminton.If your children are too young to join in these sports,there are activity clubs.Greenwood is a good place for families as it is traffic-free----you explore on foot or by bike.Some people complained that this was inconvenient,but I was pleased to be out in the fresh air.For evening entertainment,there are shows and cinemas.
    Accommodation is in a variety of apartments of different sizes.These have up to four bedrooms,a kitchen and a bathroom,as well as a dining area.Before going,I thought the apartments might not be big enough for all of us,but I was pleasantly surprised--it was not too crowded at all.
    I'll definitely go back to Greenwood next year.Why don't you give it a try? Visit their website for further information now!",high17366.txt
