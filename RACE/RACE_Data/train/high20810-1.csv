1,D,"['Creating an ever-lasting space station for astronauts.', 'Placing a man-staffed lab into orbit for long periods.', 'Carrying out large-scale experiments in laboratories.', 'Setting up a fully-equipped space engineering System.']",What is included in the second stage of China's three-stage space program?,"BEIJINCG, Feb.28, 2008 (Xinhua) -- China plans to carry out its first spacewalk in second half of the year, an official of the nation's manned space program said here on Thursday.
The Shenzhou VII spacecraft will be launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the northwestern province of Gansu late in the year and the astronauts will leave their spaceship for the first time, the official told Xinhua.
Compared with the previous two manned space flights, the upcoming Shenzhou VII space mission is more complex.Besides the spacewalk, the crew is also expected to perform extra-vehicular work such as fixing and tightening equipment.The spaceship will also release a small inspection satellite, which keeps an eye on its own performance.
China may live broadcast the first ever spacewalk.""The Shenzhou VII spaceship is able to live-broadcast the walk, but it has not been decided whether the spacewalk will be broadcast in a live or recorded version,"" the official told Xinhua.
Breakthroughs have been made in significant techniques related to the spacewalk.Research into the development of spaceship and rockets has been going smoothly, and astronauts have undertaken extensive training, according to the official.
The Shenzhou VII mission will start the second phase of China's three-stage space program.said the official.
In the second stage, China plans further breakthroughs in manned space flight, such as space walks.In this phase, China will put into orbit a space laboratory staffed by humans for short periods and create a fully-equipped space engineering system.
In the third stage, China will build a permanent space station and a space engineering system.Astronauts and scientists will travel between the Earth and the space station to conduct large-scale experiments.",high20810.txt
