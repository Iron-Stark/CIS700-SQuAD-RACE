2,B,"['People should chew gum with their mouths closed in a meeting.', 'It is impolite to chew gum in a meeting with people around you.', 'People can crack gum freely when meeting friends.', 'People should be careful when chewing gum at home.']",Which one may the author probably agree with?,"Everyone may all have the experience of feeling anxious and stressed when having a rough day or having some troubles. Different people may choose different ways to deal with it, and for most people a break for a 10-minute walk may be quite useful.www.zxxk.com
Anyway, here is another way around: to get a piece of chewing gum, and chew it. According to a Swinburne University of Technology study, gum-chewing has been found to ""relieve anxiety, improve alertness  and reduce stress among individuals in a laboratory setting.""
Some may argue that a laboratory is not the same as an office. But check out the conditions of the study: individuals were monitored while performing ""a group of 'multi-tasking' activities."" Doesn't it sound like the situation in the office?www.zxxk.com
Here's a summary of some of the study's findings:
Gum chewers showed a reduction in anxiety as compared to non-gum chewers by nearly 17 percent during mild stress and nearly 10 percent in appropriate stress.
Gum chewers showed improvement in alertness over non-gum chewers by nearly 19 percent during mild stress and 8 percent in moderate stress.
Improved Performance: Chewing gum resulted in a big improvement in overall performance on multi-tasking activities.
Although these aren't major improvements, every little bit works and chewing a piece of gum is a lot quicker and easier than slipping outside for a 10-minute walk. So, how does gum work this magic? In part it does so by lowering the level of cortisol --a steroid  hormone that is released in response to stress in your system.
A few words of advice before you reach for the gum: don't crack your gum, and be sure to chew it with your mouth closed. In fact, I'd say keep the gum out of meetings, because it really looks impolite to others around you.",high5194.txt
