2,D,"['The road to success is not always easy.', 'We should do the right thing whatever others say.', ""Our lives can be as difficult as the little stream's."", 'To succeed, we should change the way we used to be.']",What is the main idea of the story?,"A little stream   ran down from a high mountain through many villages and forests. Then it reached a desert,""I went through so many difficulties. I should have no problem crossing the desert,""she thought. As she started, she found herself slowly disappearing into the sand. After many tries, she still failed.
At this time, a deep voice said,""if a breeze   can cross the desert, so can a river.""It was the voice of the desert. But the little stream answered,""that's because a breeze can fly, but I can't.""
""That's because you can't give up what you are. Let yourself evaporate   into the breeze, and _ can take you across,""said the desert.
""Give up what I am now? No! No!""The little stream could not accept this idea.
""The breeze can carry the vapor   across the desert and let it leave as rain. The rain will form a river again,""said the desert.""And whether you're a river or vapor, your nature   never changes.""
Hearing this, the little stream went into the open arms of the breeze. It carried her to the next stage   of her life.",middle5173.txt
