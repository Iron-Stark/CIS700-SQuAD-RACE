On the last day of the year, the 31stof December, people wait till 12 pm. Everybody must have 12 grapes  to eat at midnight. At each sound of the clock, we must eat a group. But we can't ever finish eating the grapes on time! Usually when people still have some grapes in their mouths, they look at each other and start to laugh. This tradition started in Spain long ago. One year, when there were a lot of grapes, the king of Spain decided to give grapes to everybody to eat on New Year's Eve.
B Cordon from Britain
On New Year's Day in Britain, people have parties. At 12 o'clock, the music stops, and we listen to the radio. On the radio we hear Big Ben, the famous clock in London. Then everybody sings a song about friendship and kisses their friends. We say ""Happy New Year"" to each other. It's lucky if a tall man with dark hair is the first person to come to the house in the new year. So I go and visit as many friends as I can. They all give me a drink.

In all cities in Brazil, we have a big party on New Year's Eve, especially in Rio de Janeiro. People in this city go to the beaches to watch fireworks . We put flowers in the sea and think about things we want for ourselves or others. We usually wear white clothes for good luck during the New Year.",middle437.txt
