2,D,"['the story happened in spring', 'the car was driven by a woman', 'Nick spent half an hour selling one stone', 'the writer might be moved by his son']",From the passage we know   _  .,"I went home one Saturday afternoon in the autumn of 1993 to get some work done in the garden. While sweeping leaves on the ground, my five-year-old son Nick came over and asked me to write something on a piece of paper to make a sign for him.
""What for?"" I asked.
""I'm going to sell some of my stones, "" he answered.
Nick _ stones and had collected many stones from all over. ""I'm busy to
do that for you. Go and ask your mum for help."" I said.
A short time later, Nick returned with a sign, reading. "" Stones. One Dollar Each"". He took the sign, a small chair and 4 of his best stones and walked to the road in front of our garden. There he put the stones in a line and sat down on the chair.
After half an hour, nobody passed by. I walked to him and asked him to go back, but he didn't.
Another half hour later, a small car came down the road. I watched as Nick stood up, holding his sign up. A woman rolled down a window and read the sign. I couldn't hear their talk, but I saw the woman turn to the driver and the man reach for his pocket.
I sat in the yard, as Nick ran to me. Waving the dollar, he shouted. ""I told you I could sell one stone for a dollar -- if you believe in yourself, you can do anything.""",middle485.txt
