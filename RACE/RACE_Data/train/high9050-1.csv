It's true! And you can do it too. Many companies in the USA need translators now to translate simple documents online from Chinese to English, such as emails, website content, movie subtitles and more.
Companies like Real Translator Jobs are actively seeking translators from China to fill demand. There are more translation jobs than people to complete them. This leaves a big opportunity for anyone to start doing this and earn extra money.
Do you have to speak perfect English? No! Even basic knowledge of English is OK. This is really a job for anyone from China who wants to do it.
We spoke to one student from Beijing, Harris, who has been doing this for 2 years now and is earning between $150 and $225 every day. He completes about 3 to 4 jobs per day which takes him about 3 hours. It's an incredible amount of money to earn on your spare time!
It is great that we now live in the ""Information Age"" and opportunities like this are available to people in China to earn extra money working from home over the Internet. It's something that our parent's generation could have never imagined. This type of work is surely to do great things for young people in China.
If you would also like to do this, it's easy to get started. Just follow these steps:
1. Sign up at Real Translator Jobs (where Chinese translators are needed now), or a similar service.
2. Review the job posting and complete the ones you like.
3. Get paid once per month by cheque, PayPal or bank wire transfer.
