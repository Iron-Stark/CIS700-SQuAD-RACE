0,C,"['in a minute', 'at the foot of a big mountain', 'in his own back yard', 'in a garage']",Joker found one of the biggest diamonds in the world   _   .,"Joker found one of the biggest diamonds in the world right in his own back yard. He sold the stone to a diamond dealer for over three hundred thousand dollars. In New York, the diamond was resold---this time for almost eight hundred thousand dollars. The true value of a diamond is never known until it has been cut. Once cut successfully, its value can increase a thousand times. It's easy to understand why the owner of Joker's diamond went to the best diamond cutter he knew, Kaplan. The cutter studied the diamond for twelve whole months.
When he felt he was ready to start work, he discovered a flaw   . He had to begin his calculations all over again, or he might have made the stone useless. Six months passed, and Kaplan finally said to the owner, ""I am ready to start my work. There will be one excellent diamond that will be comparable one excellent diamond of first-class quality    "" Kaplan waited a few more days until he felt he was in the best physical and mental   condition  possible. He picked up his tools   and held his breath as he made the diamond exactly as he promised.",high15494.txt
