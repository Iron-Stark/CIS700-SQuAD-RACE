1,D,"['In a magic magazine.', 'In a history book.', 'In a science fiction.', 'In a newspaper.']",Where may this passage be found?,"Getting into university is hard enough at the best of times--but when your chosen institution is a work of fiction you're really up against. And that's why this young joker's Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) application to Hogwarts University was unsuccessful.
But the admissions services' response to the young man is still funny.
The unnamed A-Level student wrote a handwritten note to UCAS asking for a place studying ' _ ' at the Harry Potter school.
In the application, he was proud of his skills in ""wearing a pointy hat"" and ""Watching Paul Daniels TV Specials"".
UCAS replied, ""We regret to inform you that your application to the stated university cannot be processed at this time for the fact that it does not exist.
""After consultation with our mystic   advisors we have also determined that even if it did exist, the course 'Wandology' would be highly in demand and thus require at least two As and a B in any of the following subjects:
Advanced Spellcrafting
Mystimatics
Defence Against the Dark Arts
History of the Mysticism
Shaft Design
""Your handwritten grade sheet claiming top marks in 'Waving a stick about', 'Wearing a pointy hat' and 'Watching Paul Daniels TV Specials' sadly is not suitable for admission, however, by applying through clearing you may be suitable for a selection of Liberal Arts courses.""
""Or, you may wish to resubmit next year by tying your letter to an owl   and hoping for the best.
""On behalf of UCAS I wish you every success.""",high11033.txt
