For a start, all the information in a story must be correct. Not only the spelling and grammar, but also the facts.
Any mistakes that appear   in a story can get a newspaper into big trouble.
For example, if a newspaper said that Yang Liwei was the first man to go into space, it would be wrong. He wasn't the first. The newspaper would probably lose lots of readers because of that mistake.
A news story is not only correct ,but also relevant to its readers . People are mostly interested in news that happens near to them . That is why you care more about what happens at your school that at American schools. It is also why newspapers in Beijing don 't talk about much news in Shanghai or Hong Kong.
Finally, news must always be fresh . When you pick up your evening newspaper, you want to read about news that happens that day. You don't want to read about news from last week !
