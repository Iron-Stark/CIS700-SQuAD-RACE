1,B,"['a whale came so close to the ship', 'they saw a singing whale', 'they saw a fin back whale', 'they could touch the whale']",Everyone on the ship began to shout because    _   .,"I once experienced an unforgettable trip to Gloucester to see some of the world's most beautiful and exciting animals in their own habitat , the North Atlantic Ocean.
After a long trip by bus, we got on the ship. After a while, we stopped and everyone on the ship started to shout because we saw a humpback whale . It was wonderful. Sometimes, whales came so close to the ship that you thought you could easily touch them.
While we were watching the whales, a guide was giving us some information about them. She told us that we saw only two kinds of whales -- 50-foot humpback whales (singing whales) and 70-foot fin back whales (the second largest whales on earth). She also said we could easily recognize a whale by its tail because every whale has a different kind of tail just like people have different fingerprints.
They all have names, and on this trip, we saw ""Salt"" and ""Pepper"", two whales named by a biologist and a fisherman. They were swimming together all the time.
I took twenty-seven photos, but it was very hard to take them because the whales were quick and stayed on the surface  of the ocean just for a short time. It was really something. It was one of the chances that a person hardly ever experiences in life, but I had that chance.",high15984.txt
