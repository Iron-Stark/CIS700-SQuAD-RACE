1,A,"['have worked for ""Books for Kids""', 'have received books and money from Rose Ciotta', 'now work as teachers in local high schools', 'became interested in reading thanks to the program']",Both of the author's children   _  .,"The joys of reading are the ones I've known since childhood, and they continue to this day. And the benefits of reading, for me, are immeasurable. Loving the written words was what led me to journalism.
But not every child has the chance to enjoy these pleasures and benefits. In Buffalo---one of the poorest cities in the nation---this is particularly true. Over a third of Buffalo's children are living in poverty. Families who struggle for food and clothing certainly don't have the money for books.
That's where a Buffalo news-sponsored program called ""Books for Kids"" steps in. Through an unusual book drive  and collection of cash donations, the effort places books into the hands of needy local children, usually through community organizations that serve children.
Since it began in 1995 ---the  _ of Rose Ciotta, then a Buffalo news reporter, along with two wonderful local Buffalo State college professors, Geraldine Bard and Elizabeth Cappella ---the effort has distributed more than 1.5 million books to children.
Returning to the personal side, both of my children know the value of putting books in the hands of children. Successful students themselves became interested from an early age. My sons, Alex, now a college senior, founded the Books for Kids High School Coalition as a Canisius High School student. He handed it down to his sister, Grace, a Nardin Academy senior this year, who has carried on the tradition of organizing book drives in local high schools. It's been one of the great satisfactions of my life that both of my children have been deeply involved in the program.",high21460.txt
