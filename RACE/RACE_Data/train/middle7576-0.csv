0,D,"['To go to a concert.', 'To become interested in music.', 'To join the army.', 'To go through something unhappy.']","What does the expression ""to face the music"" exactly mean?","When someone says, ""I guess I'll have to face the music"", it doesn't mean he is going to a concert. It is something unhappy. For example, a student is called in by his teacher to explain why he didn't finish his homework.
Every American, young or old, knows the phrase ""to face the music"" well. It's at least 100 years old. Where did the expression come from?
One explanation   is about the American writer James Fennimore Cooper. He said the expression was first used by actors. When they were asked to perform, they would say, ""It's time to face the music."" And that is exactly what they did-face the band which is just below the stage  .
An actor might be nervous when he moved onto the stage in front of the audience  . But he had to go out. So, ""to face the music"" came to mean having to go through something no matter how unhappy it might be, because you had no choice.
The other explanation comes from the army. The soldiers had to face their leader's check. They were worried about how well they looked. Were their guns clean enough to pass the check? Still, the men had to go out to face the check. What else could they do?",middle7576.txt
