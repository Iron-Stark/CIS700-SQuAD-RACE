0,A,"['In the morning.', 'At noon.', 'In the afternoon.', 'In the evening']",When did the writer and her son usually stop at the local store?,"A few years ago, I worked at a church . Since my son was home schooling, he went with me to the church every day. Most mornings, we'd stop at a local store, and get a chocolate drink for him and a cup of coffee for me.
The clerk  at the store made our lives more enjoyable each day, and so we returned again and again. She had found her own way of enjoying life and her job. I'm not even sure if she realized that her warmth and brightness put a smile upon the face of each customer .
When a customer brought cakes to the counter, any other clerk could have asked: ""Would you like some milk with those cakes?"" Instead, she asked: ""Would you like a lottery ticket  with those cakes?""
She might have asked me if I wanted sugar with my coffee. But instead, she asked: ""Would you like some batteries  with that coffee?""
Yes, life is what you make of it. This clerk's method of dealing with what some think is a boring job, and with the customers she met daily, made the hours in her day more enjoyable. In doing that, she also refreshed the lives of others and made them laugh.
Sometimes, if my day at the church had been very tiring, we'd stop at that store before going home. We'd giggle   as we left the store, the clerk's words echoing   behind us.
""Would you like some shampoo   with that orange juice?""",middle7774.txt
