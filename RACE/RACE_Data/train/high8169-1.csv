1,C,"['polar bears are getting stressed', 'other creatures are losing weight', 'many animals do not respond well to travellers in their backyard', 'All of the above']","According to New Scientist magazine, more and more evidence has come to suggest that   _  .","LONDON ( Reuters)-- Ecotourism   is causing a lot of damage to wildlife and may be endangering the survival  of the very animals people are flocking to see, according to researchers.
Biologists and conservationists   are worried because polar bears, dolphins, penguins and other creatures are getting stressed and losing weight and some are dying.
""Evidence is growing that many animals do not react well to tourists in their backyard,"" New Scientist magazine said.
The immediate effects researchers have noticed are changes in behavior, heart rates, or stress hormone levels but they fear it could get much worse and over the long term ""could endanger the survival of the very wildlife they want to see"".
Although money produced through ecotourism, which has been growing at about 10--30 percent a year, has major benefits for poor countries and people living in rural areas, the Swiss-based World Conservation Union (IUCN) and some governments fear not all projects are audited   and based on environmentally friendly policies, according to the magazine.
""The transmission  of disease to wildlife, or small changes to wildlife health through disturbance of daily life or increased stress levels, while not obvious to the casual observer, may translate to lower survival and breeding,"" said Philip Seddon, of the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand.
Scientists have noticed that bottleneck dolphins along the northeastern coast of New Zealand become nervously excited when tourist boats arrive. Similar changes in behavior have been observed in polar bears and yellow-eyed penguins in areas visited by ecotourists are producing smaller babies.
Conservationists are now calling for more research into the effect of ecotourism on animals and say the industry must be developed carefully. They also want studies done before new ecotourism projects are started.
""The animals' welfare should be very important because without them there will be no ecotourism,"" said Rochelle Constantine of the University of Auckland in New Zealand.",high8169.txt
