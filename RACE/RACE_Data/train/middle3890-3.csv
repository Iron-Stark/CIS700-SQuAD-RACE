3,B,"['Carrying potatoes.', 'Less hatred, happier life.', 'Keeping sadness and hatred.', 'a bag of potatoes']",Which is the best title of the passage,"One day at the end of the class, a wise teacher told each of her students to bring a plastic bag and a bag of potatoes to school.
The next day she told her students, ""From today on, for every person you don't like in your lives, you can choose a potato, write the person's name and the date on it and then put it in the plastic bag."" Day after day, some of the students' bags were very heavy. They were then told to carry this bag with them everywhere they went for a week. They would put it inside their quilts at night, on the seats when sitting in a car or on a bus, and next to their desks at school. The days carrying the bag around with them made students get to know what a weight they were carrying in their minds. They had to pay attention to it all the time so that they wouldn't forget it. As time passed by, the potatoes went bad and smelt nasty . They all tried to get rid of them.
Too often we think of tolerance  as a gift to other people, and clearly it is for ourselves!  If we choose to keep our sadness and hatred in our hearts, we will have to carry them around all our lives.
Do you think you have got anything from the wise teacher and what she asked her students to do?",middle3890.txt
