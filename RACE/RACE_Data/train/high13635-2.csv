2,B,"['good children always do the right thing', 'parents should try their best to avoid spanking their children', 'parents have no choice but to spank their children', 'children can have more than one choice to avoid being spanked']","From this passage,we can conclude that","Sometimes children do not do what their parents tell them to do.When this happens,a parent tries to help the child to do the right thing.When this does not work,the parent usually punishes the child.
There are many things that a parent can do.One thing that people have done is to spank the child.When a parent spanks a child, they will use their hand or a hard object to strike them on the bottom.This means showing the child that they have done something wrong.
One parent remembers being spanked when he was a child.His parents used a wooden spoon.When he spanked his own children with his hand, he saw that he put a red mark on his child's leg.He never did that again.
One problem with spanking is that it teaches the child to hit someone when they do not like what the other person is doing.Another problem with spanking is that the parent is usually angry and can hit the child too hard.Sometimes parents will use spanking for everything and not try other ways to get the child to do the right thing.
Many parents are not sure of what to do instead of spanking.Some people think that their religion tells them that spanking is okay.Some think that the law lets them do it.The courts say that parents have the right to teach their children how to behave.
Other things should be tried before a parent decides to spank a child.Telling the child exactly what is wanted from them can be one thing.Giving a child more than one choice is another thing that can be tried.Getting down to the child's level and taking a more child-friendly approach can help as well.",high13635.txt
