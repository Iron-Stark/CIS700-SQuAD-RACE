I went to an English language school. I was not a beginner, but I was not good at English. At the end of the first term, I could read, write and speak, and I thought I was good at them. However, I was not good at understanding   when people spoke to me. My teacher said,"" Why don't you repeat   the classes?"" I was not happy. I made progress   every month, so I did not want to repeat them. However, it was true -- I was not good at understanding when people spoke to me. My teacher said, ""Repeating the classes is a good way to practice listening. And if you repeat them, you will understand more spoken English."" In the end, I repeated the classes. In the second term, I studied the same books that I did in the first term. My teacher was right. It was a good idea. Now, after studying English for a year, I can understand more spoken English. And I know that reading, writing and speaking are not enough; listening is also very important.",middle6744.txt
