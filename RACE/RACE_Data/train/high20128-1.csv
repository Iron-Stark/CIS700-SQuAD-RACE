Edinburgh Young Carers Project
We work with young carers aged 5-18. We want to colour the lives of some of these young people by introducing them to someone who will try to understand them, listen, work towards agreed goals and have some FUN! Is that person you? Are you aged 18-25, could you help and encourage a young person to recognise what they want and work towards getting it?You can encourage and help someone and in return help yourself! You will learn new skills and build on your own experience.
