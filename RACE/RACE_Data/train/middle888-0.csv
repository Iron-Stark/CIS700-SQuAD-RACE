0,C,"['Twenty-three', 'Twenty-four', 'Twenty-five', 'Twenty-six']","_  students from Westfield State College were on vacation in Acapulco, Mexico.","Moreno, Stanley, and 23 other students from Westfield State College were on vacation in Acapulco, Mexico. This was the last night in the hotel. It was 4 am, Moreno and   Stanley came back from a party.
Just as Stanley went to sleep, he heard loud noise outside. From the balcony   of their fourth-floor room, Moreno and Stanley saw black smoke out of one window and heard people shouting.
Moreno ran out into the corridor and began knocking on doors and shouting, ""Fire!"" After that, he went upstairs in a hurry to tell other people. At the same time, Stanley was downstairs helping people get through the smoke-filled room. There he joined forces with Nalewanski, a 21-year-old boy who had a room on the second floor.
""Let's go,"" Nalewanski said. He and Stanley wet their shirts in the bathroom and put them around their mouths and noses so they could breathe. Then they ran up the stairs. On the fourth floor they found  Moreno feeling terrible (Moreno had made it up to the eighth floor before turning back). But after making sure he could get back down on his own, they continued upstairs, knocking on the doors on every floor.
In the end, no one was seriously hurt. Moreno said, ""There were hundreds of people in the hotel. It was our duty to help them.""",middle888.txt
