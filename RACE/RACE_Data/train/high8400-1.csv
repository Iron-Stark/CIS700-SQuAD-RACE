1,A,"['women are hard to please', 'husbands are hard to shop', 'women think they are better than men', ""women can't be too careful when choosing husbands""]",The writer intends us to believe that   _  .,"A store that sells husbands has just opened in Ottawa where a woman may go to choose a husband from many men.
The store is comprised of 6 floors and the men increase in positive attributes(,)as the shopper goes up the flights. There is, however, a catch . As you open the door to any floor you may choose a man from that floor, but if you go up a floor, you cannot go back down except to exit the building.
So a woman goes to the shopping center to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads: Floor 1--These men have jobs. The woman reads the sign and says to herself, ""Well, that's better than my last boyfriend, but I wonder what's further up?""
So up she goes. The second floor sign reads: Floor 2--These men have jobs and love kids. The woman remarks to herself, ""That's great, but I wonder what's further up?""
And up she goes again. The third floor sign reads: Floor 3--These men have jobs, love kids and are extremely good-looking. ""Hmm, better.""
The fourth floor sign reads: Floor 4--These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good-looking and help with the housework. ""Wow!"" exclaims the woman, ""Very tempting. But, there must be more, further up!""
And again she heads up another flight. The fifth floor sign reads: Floor 5--These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good-looking, help with the housework and have a strong romantic character. ""Oh, mercy me! But just think...what must be awaiting me further on?""
So up to the sixth floor she goes. The sixth floor sign reads: Floor 6 -You are visitor 3, 456, 789,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. Thank you for shopping Husband Mart and have a nice day.",high8400.txt
