4,C,"[""Mike's neighbours are polite to his father."", ""Mike's neighbours don't want the pumpkin because it is too small."", 'Mr. Lee thinks neighbours are always friendly and kind.', ""Mr. Lee will bring some pumpkins to Mike's neighbours again.""]",Which is RIGHT?,"Mike's father, Mr. Lee, is a farmer. He lives on the farm. He is happy to see his son move to a new flat in the city. One day, Mr. Lee comes to visit his son with a big orange pumpkin, about 10 kg. He grows it all by himself. ""I'll let my son share it with his neighbours  . Everyone likes pumpkin. Then Mike and his neighbours will become good friends,"" Mr. Lee thinks.
At noon, Mr. Lee gets to the community centre . The building is so tall. There are twenty floors. Mike lives on the sixteenth floor. But he is not at home.
Mr. Lee thinks, ""I'll give the pumpkin to Mike's neighbours. They will be glad too see the gift."" And he does it. But to his surprise, the neighbour on the left says coldly, ""Thank you, but I don't like it at all.""The woman on the right says nothing and closes the door quickly.
The old man feels sad. At last, he goes to the market, sells it and goes back home. ""Are they really neighbours? "" he says to himself. He doesn't know why.",middle5731.txt
