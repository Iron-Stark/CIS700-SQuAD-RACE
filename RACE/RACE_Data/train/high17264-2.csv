Dear Ms Rogers,
As I'm sure you are aware, our company has been organizing conventions, festivals, and other large corporate events for the last fifteen years. We have relied on your company for purchase and rental supplies of high--quality furniture for that entire period, and we've never had any cause for complaints with regard to your services.
I am writing to you personally to ask a special favor. We recently made an order with your company for the supply of rental furniture that includes chairs, tables, and partitions for an auto show (see order No. 11--35698A). Unfortunately, a serious error was made. In fact the show begins one week earlier than indicated on the order form. The starting date is actually July 7. I would appreciate it very much if you could try to do everything you can to ensure that our order be delivered to us on that date. Also, if possible, I'd like to add 20 Pop-up displays on top of our original order.
Please contact me soon.
Yours sincerely
Michael Robinson
Properties Manager

Dear Mr Robinson,
Thank you for your letter. I was surprised and of course concerned that you find yourself in this unfortunate situation. And of course I will do my best to help you.
Anyway, I personally look a trip down to our warehouse this morning to have a closer look at our stock to see if we have all the things you need for your convention--which I believe is from July 7 to July 14. I am happy to say that we will be able to provide you with everything you originally requested. However, as for the additional request you made, it won't be possible because we have already rented them out to another client during that week.
Kind regards,
Suzanne Rogers
