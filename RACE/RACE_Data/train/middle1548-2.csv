2,D,"['When people talk about weather', 'When people stay at home', 'When the farmers need water', 'When people have a picnic']","_  , they always hope the weather is going to be fine.","An American writer, Mr Green once  said, ""Everybody talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it."" It is true that everybody talks about the weather. Many people begin their talks by saying, ""Isn't it a nice day?"" ""Do you think it will rain?"" ""I think it's going to snow.""
Many people think they can tell what the weather is going to be like. But sometimes they don't agree with each other. One man may say, ""Do you see how cloudy it is in the east? It's going to rain tomorrow."" Another man will say, ""No, it's going to be fine tomorrow.""
People often look for the weather they want. When a farmer needs water, he looks for something to tell him it's going to rain, and he doesn't look for anything else. When friends have a picnic, they hope the weather is going to be fine and they can sit eating their lunch under the blue sky.
Almost everyone listens to what the weatherman says. But he doesn't always tell us what we want, and sometimes he makes a mistake. Still, he is right most of the time.",middle1548.txt
