The gloves are known as 'Talk to the Hand' and costPS1.000 a pair.
They come with a speaker unit embedded into the thumb and a microphone built into the little finger that can be connected to any mobile handset using Bluetooth.Artist Sean Miles designed the gloves that double as a phone in part of his project that shows the possibilities of gadget recycling.He combines gloves with parts from mobile handsets recycled through O2,which commissioned the project.
Mobile phone users will be able to keep their hands warm while they chat without taking   their phone out of their pocket or handbag.
Mr Miles designed two pairs of the new gloves--one in pink and the other in brown and   yellow.They will appear in an exhibition this July and visitors will be able to win the gloves.If demand is high,they will then be produced on a larger scale.
O2 Recycle,which backs the project,estimates that there are already 70 million unused   mobile handsets in the UK.The service pays those who recycle gadgets including phones,MP3   players and digital cameras.    
Designer Scan Miles,hopes his work will get people thinking about recycling.The 41-year-old said:""I hope that my Talk to the Hand project will get people to think again about   the waste created by not recycling gadgets.If a few more people recycle their gadgets rather   than send them to landfill ,I think this project will have fulfilled its aim.""
The Talk to the Hand mobile phone gloves are the second product in a series that O2  Recycle and Miles have created.Miles is now working on combining phones with handbags--so people don't spend time rummaging around in their bags to find a phone when it rings.",high18020.txt
