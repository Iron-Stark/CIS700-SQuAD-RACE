2,C,"['professional, brave but dirty', 'smart, sensitive and helpful', 'greedy, tough but flexible', 'honest, clever and reliable']","In the eyes of the Duke and Duchess, Ogilvie was   _  .","Ogilvie the detective arrived. Both the Duke and Duchess were extremely nervous.
The Duchess went to the door herself. The detective's piggy eyes surveyed her. His gaze moved on to sweep the spacious, well-decorated room, and the Duke.
""Pretty neat set-up you've got.""Ogilvie said slowly.
The Duchess said sharply, ""Imagine you didn't come here to discuss the decoration.""
""No, Madame. I like nice things, though. Like that expensive car of yours. The one you keep here in the hotel.""
""In what way does our car concern you?""The Duchess had sat in a straight-backed chair.
""Now,"" he said.""You two were in the hit-and-run.""
She met his eyes directly. ""What are you talking about?""
""Don't play games, lady. You saw the newspapers. There's been plenty on radio, too."" Ogilvie's words spat forth with sudden strength. ""You listen to me. This city's mad -- everybody. When they find who killed that kid and her mother, and run away, what will they do? Now I know what I know, and if I do what by rights I should, there'll be police here. But I come to you first, so you could tell your side of it to me."" The piggy eyes blinked, then hardened. ""If you want it the other way, just say so.""
The Duchess--three centuries and a half of in-born pride behind her--did not give in easily. Springing to her feet with great anger, gray-green eyes burning, she faced the detective straightly. Her tone would have frightened anyone who knew her well. ""You unspeakable blackguard! How dare you!""
Ogilvie said nothing. But the Duke cut in, ""It's no go, old girl, I'm afraid. It was a good try."" Facing Ogilvie, he said, ""What you accuse us of is true. I was driving the car and killed the little girl.""
""That's more like it,"" Ogilvie said, ""now we're getting somewhere.""
The Duchess sank back into her chair. She asked, ""What is it you know?""
""I'll tell you, I got a curious nature. You and your wife drove home, you were driving, after a drink. Last night I saw you come in--through the basement, looking shaken, the pair of you. I got wondering why. Like I said, I got a curious nature.""
The Duchess breathed, ""Go on.""
""Late last night the word was out about the hit-and-run. I went over the garage and took a quiet look at your car. On your car you got a damaged headlight. There's plenty of blood.""
""Oh, my God!""A hand to her face, the Duchess turned away.
Her husband asked, ""What do you suggest?""
The fat man rubbed his hands together, ""Like I said, I come to hear your side of it.""
The Duke said desperately, ""What can I possibly say? You know what happened. You'd better call the police.""
""There's no way bringing back the kid nor her mother. Besides, what they'd do to you, Duke, you wouldn't like it at all. I was hoping,"" Ogilvie said, ""that you could suggest something.""
The Duke said uncertainly, ""I don't understand.""
""I understand,"" the Duchess said. ""You want money. You came here to blackmail  us.""
The house detective shrugged . ""Whatever names you call things, they don't matter to me. All I come for is to help you people out of trouble. But I've got to live too.""
""You'd accept money to keep silent about what you know?""
""I think so.""
""How much do you want?""
The piggy eyes blinked.""Ten thousand dollars.""
""What would we receive in return?""
The fat man seemed puzzled. ""Like I said, I keep quiet about what I know.""
""No."" The statement was clear. ""We will not pay you.""
Ogilvie's round face reddened, ""Now listen, lady....""
She cut him off. ""I won't listen. Instead, you will listen to me. We won't pay you $10,000. But we will pay you $25,000. In return, you will drive our car north.""
""$25,000,"" she repeated. ""$10,000 now. $15,000 more when you meet us in Chicago.""
The fat man's piggy eyes were focused upon hers. The silence hung. Then, he gave the slightest of nods.",high10270.txt
