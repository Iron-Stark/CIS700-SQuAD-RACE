2,B,"['Arts and crafts lessons are very popular in schools.', 'Art is not paid enough attention to in schools now.', 'Art activities improve the amount of brain activity.', 'Art education builds up the levels of self-confidence.']",What can be inferred from the passage?,"Education is another area where the presence of arts and crafts is more than welcome. If children realize the importance of art and creativity from a young age, they can grow up to be more confident, more creative, and definitely more mature. Schools are the breeding grounds for future painters and movie makers, and these arts should be encouraged wholesomely in such an environment.
Sadly, many parents do not understand why art is important for children, and subconsciously force them to follow career paths that are common and conformist in nature. This is fair enough in its own way, because the world does need some standard blue collar and white collar jobs to continue its existence; but this is a choice that children should be allowed to make for themselves. The doors to creativity and expression must not be shut in their faces, even if it comes at a cost of making more money.
To put it more scientifically, here are some benefits of kids' art activities that give a suitable answer to the question ""Why is art important in schools?""
1.Exposure to art, music and drawings at an early age improves the amount of brain activity in children.
2.It increases the span of knowledge in the minds of children, thus making them sharper and more educated.

4.It helps children understand other people's opinions and points of view as well.
