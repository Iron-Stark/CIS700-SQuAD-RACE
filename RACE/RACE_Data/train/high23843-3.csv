3,A,"[""show NICE's new guidance on pregnant women's alcohol drinking and its advice for the care of pregnant women"", 'warn pregnant women against any alcohol during pregnancy', ""show the present situation of pregnant women's drinking limit"", 'call for more care for pregnant women in society']","In this passage, the author mainly intends to   _  .","Women should not drink any alcohol during pregnancy. A report released by NICE says. It says if they must drink, they should not do so in the first three months and should limit to one or two ounces once or twice a week afterwards. It replaces previous guidance of saying small daily amounts were fine.
NICE decided to tighten its guidance partly because of the concern that people are now drinking more than in the past. Previous draft guidance suggested women should drink an ounce of alcohol a day once they were past the first three months of pregnancy. The Department of Health in England changed its guidance last year, calling for no drinking while pregnant or while trying to get pregnant. 
Drinking heavily in pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol syndrome  , which can leave children with features like small heads, widely spaced eyes and behavior or learning problems.
The experts said there was no evidence that several ounces once or twice a week would do any harm to the baby but could not categorically rule out   any risk. 
National Childbirth Trust agreed women should limit their drinking during pregnancy.  ""Pregnant women who have had a few drinks often worry a great deal about whether they have harmed their baby. In general, it is believed that if a light infrequent drinker, in good health, drinks to the point of drunkenness on one occasion, the risk to her baby is small.""
NICE also made a number of other recommendations for the care of women in the UK who were pregnant or planning to get pregnant. It said vitamin D and folic acid   supplements should be offered by health staff to help avoid conditions such as rickets   and spina bifida  . Officials also called for local health officials to ensure equal support plans where mothers encourage new parents to breastfeed are set up. NICE also called for improvements in the care of pregnant women with diabetes. About 20;000 pregnancies each year are affected by diabetes and, therefore, carry, higher risk of miscarriage   and still birth. The guidance said women should get access to advice and support, in particular to achieve good blood sugar control before they get pregnant.",high23843.txt
