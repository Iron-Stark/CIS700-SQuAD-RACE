    More Americans are Googling themselves-and many are checking out their friends,co-workers and romantic interests,too.
    In a report Sunday, the Pew Internet and American Life Project said 47 percent of U.S.adult Internet users have looked for information about themselves through Google or another search engine.That is more than twice the 22 percent of users who did in 2002,but Pew senior research
specialist Mary Madden was surprised the growth wasn't higher.

Often,it's to find someone they've lost touch with.But looking up information about friends,  s,colleagues and neighbors was also common.
Although men and women equally searched for online information about themselves.women were slightly more likely to look up information about someone they are dating.
    In many cases,the search is just done to find someone's contact information.But a third of those who have conducted searches on others have looked for public records,such as bankruptcies and divorce proceedings.A similar number have searched for someone else's photo.
