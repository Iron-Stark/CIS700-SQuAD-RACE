1,A,"['three.', 'five.', 'six.', 'eight.']",There are   _   people appearing in the story.,"As soon as the woman got into the house, her eight-year-old daughter told her that her younger brother drew so many pictures on the clean wall of his bedroom and left the white wall in a mess.
When the woman heard this, she was angry. ""Where's your brother now?""
""He's hiding himself in the cupboard in his bedroom."" The little girl answered.
The woman got even angrier. She complained about her son when she went towards her son's bedroom.
The six-year-old boy was staying with fear in the cupboard when he heard what his mother said. He knew she got really angry this time.
The woman pushed the door open with a loud noise. But when she saw the words and pictures on the wall, her anger soon disappeared. ""I love you, mum!"" covered the whole wall, with so many hearts around them, and so many stars in the sky.
The mother's eyes were full of happy tears. She opened the door of the cupboard, and hugged   her son tightly. The boy said ""I love you, Mum!"" to her mother in a low voice when he was in his mother's arms.
It's the most expensive present from her son -- ""Love on the wall"". Eight years later, the boy suddenly died of heart disease. The mother had kept the wall tidy with great care for nearly fifty years until she was dead.
In the mother's heart, it seemed that her son was alive, and always looking at her in the sky with many shining stars around him.",middle7676.txt
