4,A,"['After the final exams ,school children will stay at school for extra classes.', 'The summer holidays is a good time to go out for a trip.', 'The children from the countryside can have a good time in the woods in the summer holiday.', 'If some children go on a trip to the seaside, they will have many things to talk about.']",Which of the following is Not true according to the passage?,"When July comes, children know they'll have the final exams and the school year will end soon. Boys and girls will have a nearly two months' holiday, and they'll leave school by train or by car to return home to see their fathers and mothers.
The summer holiday is the best time of the year for most students. The weather is good, so they can spend most of their time playing outside .If one lives in the country, he can go on a trip into the woods or in the fields. If one lives in a big city, he can go to a park to play.
The best place for a summer holiday is the seaside. Some children are lucky enough to live near the sea. But for the others who do not, if they have the chance to stay at one of the big seaside towns for a week or two, they will talk about it all the following school year.
Now, what makes children like the seaside so much? I think it is the sand, the sea and the sun, not anything else. Of course, there are lots of new things to see, nice things to eat and interesting things to do. But the feeling of the sand under their feet, the salt water on their skin, and the warm sun on their backs make them happier.",middle981.txt
