3,D,"['confident', 'optimistic', 'learned', 'enthusiastic']","According to the writer, young people are  _  .","Someone asked me, ""what do you think of youth?"" I showed him a can of COKE. See this?
""C"" means ""courage"". There's a seed in everyone's heart. As long as you really keep watering it, it will grow and harvest. Courage gives us the power to follow our dreams. Believe in yourself and be prepared for anything in the future.
""O"" stands for ""optimism"". When in trouble, some people feel disappointed but some people still keep their dreams. Be sure to choose the latter. Life is very much like a mirror. If you smile on it, it smiles back on you. If you frown, you will get a similar look in return. Throw away the sadness in your heart while filling it with brightness and hope.
""K"" can be understood as ""knowledge"". In order to keep up with the times, we should use knowledge to enrich ourselves. Knowledge is the food of thought and, as long as it is put in our brain, we will grow wiser.
""E"" is short for ""enthusiasm  "". Enthusiasm is the sign of youth. We use colourful paint-brushes in our hands to create the pictures of youth on our own. Let the sky and sea know we're young. Let out our enthusiasm wherever we go.
Drink a can of COKE. You will find your youth as refreshing   as a can of coke. Enjoy and value your youth.",high2530.txt
