Thank you for asking me to play soccer with you. But I'm afraid I can't. I have a piano lesson on Tuesday. Maybe another time.

Sandy,
Thank you very much for inviting me to your birthday party on Friday. I'd love to come, but I have to go to New York that day. It's very kind of you. I hope you have a happy birthday party.
Nancy
Lucy,
Thanks for your invitation. I'd love to go to your house for dinner on Thursday. But I have to get my things ready for travelling. How about coming to my house with Lily? My mother cooks fish very well. I think you'll like it. I hope to see you before I'm leaving.
Nancy
Rose,
Would you like to come to my house for dinner tonight? Many of our good friends will come.
