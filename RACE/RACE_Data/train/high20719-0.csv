0,A,"['When the Computer Is Down', 'The Most Frightening Thing', 'The Computer of. the Airport', 'Asking the Computer']",The best title for the article is  _  .,"The most frightening words in the English language are,  ""Our computer is down."" You hear it more and more when you are on business. The other day I was at the airport waiting for a ticket to Washington and the girl in the ticket office said, ""I'm sorry, I can't sell you a ticket. Our computer is down.""
       ""If your computer is down, just write me out a ticket.""
       ""I can't write you, out a ticket. The computer is the only one allowed to do so:""
       I looked down on the computer and every passenger was just star, ding there, drinking coffee and staring at the black screen. Then I asked her,  ""What do all you people do?""
       ""We give the computer the information about your trip, and then it tells us whether you can fly with us or not.""
       ""How lorig will the computer be down?"" I wanted to know.
       ""I have no idea. Sometimes it,s down for 10 minutes, sometimes for two hours. There's no way we can find odt without asking the computer, and since it's down it won't answer, us.""
       After the girl told me they had no backup   computer, I said.  ""Let's forget the computer. What about your planes? They're still flying, aren't they?""
       I wouldn't know,""  she said, pointino at the dark screen. ""Only 'IT' knows. 'It' can't tell me.""
      By this time there were quite a few people standing in lines. The words soon spread to other travelers that the computer was down. Some people went white; some people started to cry and still others kicked.their luggage.",high20719.txt
