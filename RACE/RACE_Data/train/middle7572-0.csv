A group of Canadian kids are spreading a bit of Christmas spirit in Halifax, Nova Scotia, by covering warm clothes around light poles   for the city's homeless people to pick up and use. _ was such an unusual sight that locals stopped to take pictures to share on social media  .
Every year, Tara Atkins-Smith collects warm clothes from her community in order to help the less lucky. This year, since the family was traveling to Halifax with their daughter Jayda and seven of her friends to celebrate her 8thbirthday Tara thought it was the perfect time to teach the chidren a valuable life lesson.
The kids spent time handing out coats to the homeless and tied the rest around light poles for others to pick up. Each of the clothes had a tag that read, ""I am not lost. If you are caught in the cold, please take me to keep warm. "" According to Tara, the experience helped the children better understand the difficult situation of homeless people, who have to brave the cold winter on the streets. ""When we got back in the car after an hour on the street, they were all freezing cold and crying for the heater   to be on because they were cold , "" she said.
By next morning, all the jackets, gloves, and scarves on the poles were gone. Photos of the inspriring project have been shared about 8, 000 times on Facebook, and have got over10,000 likes. Tara, who did something similar in Toronto in December last year, says she's already planning next year's coat drive.
