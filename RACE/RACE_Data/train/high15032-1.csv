1,B,"['They can be made by phone.', 'They are available only to students.', 'They can be made several weeks ahead.', 'They are available to groups of any size.']",What can we know about bookings of group study rooms in the library?,"When you use our university libraries there are different learning spaces available so you can decide what is best for your purpose.
Social learning area
We recognize that you can learn from your friends so we have provided social study areas in all our libraries. Here you can discuss your work with your friends without worrying about disturbing others as a reasonable level of noise is accepted, though we do ask that you're considerate of other students and staff.
Group study rooms
There are bookable  group study rooms of various sizes in the libraries. These rooms are well equipped so that you can easily work in groups or practice presentations.
*Bookings are available to groups of 3 or more students
*Bookings can be made in hourly blocks up to a maximum of 2 hours per group per day
*Bookings can be made for the current week and the following week
*Contact the library Help Desk to book a room. Bookings are restricted to student use only.
Silent study spaces
We know that on occasion you may prefer to study on your own.  To help you achieve this we have individual quiet or silent study areas.
In order to preserve the quiet study environment and to avoid disturbing other students, discussion about your course work or exams, or using mobile phones isn't permitted anywhere in these areas.
Food, drink and phones
Cold snacks and drinks can be consumed in most areas of the libraries though we ask that you help keep the learning environment clean and pleasant for everyone by clearing rubbish into the bins provided.
Mobile phones can be used in the social learning areas and group study rooms but not in the silent study spaces or the hallways or stairs that lead to those areas. We ask that you switch your phone to silent mode when you come in the library.",high15032.txt
