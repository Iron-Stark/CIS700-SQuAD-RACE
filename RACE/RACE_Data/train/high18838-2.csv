How the earthquake has affected one of Sichuan Province's special residents--pandas. How are the animals coping? And do they have enough food to eat? 
There are more than 80 pandas living here at the Chengdu Panda Breeding Base. 7 baby pandas have just left their mothers and have begun to learn how to fend for themselves. 
The quake was felt strongly in Chengdu. Fortunately, all of the pandas here were out on the grounds when the earthquake hit, so they were very safe. Although no deaths or injuries have been reported among the Baoxing panda population so far, they've been badly frightened by the earthquake. Several days has passed and the earthquake seems to have made no discernible negative impact on the pandas. These two baby pandas Chengshuang and Chengdui are play fighting with each other and climbing trees. When they climbed too high, the breeders have to rescue them from the trees. 
The visitors are amused by the scenes and think it's like a fantastic acrobatics show. 
The quake zone is not only the home of these pandas, it's also the source of their food. Fortunately, enough bamboo has been stored away in five bamboo storehouses for the pandas, so there are no worries with regard to food supplies. 
Wu Kongju, Breeder, Chengdu Panda Breeding Base, said, ""When the Wenchuan earthquake happened in 2008, we were unprepared and had a shortage of bamboo. But we've been able to handle this earthquake event more smoothly. There are no problems with the food supply. ""Apart from the pandas' favorite Baijia Bamboo, breeders also give them bamboo shoots, which are very rich in nutrients. 
Wu Kongju said, ""Bamboo shoots contain more protein than ordinary bamboo, and they're also very succulent because they contain more water. """,high18838.txt
