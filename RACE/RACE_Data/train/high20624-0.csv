It had served this poor neighborhood for nearly 100 years but it would close because of the health care crisis.

A week later, I decided to cheer up my co-workers by picking up some soft pretzels at a local store. I arrived just as it opened so I was the only customer. But I only had $6 in my wallet. I was working inside a large office at the hospital and knew I'd need more than the half dozen pretzels my six dollars would buy. A man's voice interrupted my thoughts. ""Can I help you?"" 
I said, ""I only have $6. I'm not sure how many pretzels I need. You see, I work at a hospital and it's closing and they stopped selling pretzels."" The man's smile disappeared. ""What hospital?"" ""Oh, Northeastern Hospital.""
