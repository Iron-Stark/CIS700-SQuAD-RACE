1,A,"['Love from Heaven', 'Fight against Diseases', 'Respect for Father', 'Secrets in Store']",What's the best title for the passage?,"Even after his death, Mitchell Whisenhunt has found a way to surprise and bring comfort to his wife and young daughter, with some letters he designated to be opened on certain dates.
Mitchell lost his battle with Marfan syndrome at 26. The rare genetic disorder affects the body's connective tissue, which is used to hold together organs, cells and tissue.
Ashley Whisenhunt, 22, cared for her husband until his death but said she was astonished when she discovered the 30 letters he left for her, their 18-month-old daughter Brynleigh and the community.
The little girl will grow up with a letter every year from her second to 18th birthday from a man she didn't get to spend much time with but who left no doubt that he loved her unconditionally. ""Through his testimony,there is so much she is going to learn,"" Ashley told ABC News.
One letter was also addressed to their Longview, Texas, community, thanking them for their support.
""It just blows my mind,"" Ashley said of her husband's secret gesture. ""He thought about everybody else instead of himself.""
Ashley said she would respect her husband's wishes and open each letter as he planned, however there was one special surprise left for her that she said hit her the hardest.
In a spiral notebook that Ashley used before she dropped out of college to care for her husband, he wrote a letter to her asking that she publish a book of poetry he had written.
Mitchell Whisenhunt even planned his own funeral, and the funeral director said he couldn't tell Ashley because it was Mitchell's plan and secret. Ashley said she couldn't help but wonder what other surprises her husband had in store. ""There are ones we still don't know about it,"" she said.",high12815.txt
