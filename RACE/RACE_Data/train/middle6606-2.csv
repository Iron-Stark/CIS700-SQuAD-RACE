They were ready to fight with the bear.""]",What was the loud noise behind the writer?,"On the first evening, the three of us were tired after walking for about eight hours. We soon fell asleep. In the morning, I was surprised to find the bag of food had been open.
""Bears,"" said Joe, ""we should hang the food in a tree tonight.""
Later that day we stopped in a beautiful field by a river. We put up the tent and fell asleep. During the night the bears came again. This time they took the food from the tree.
""Bears can climb trees. They can smell food from a long way away,"" said Ben.
""We must keep the camp clean. Bears must think our rubbish is food,"" I said. ""And we should make lots of noise, too. If they know where we are, they may not come any closer,"" said Joe.
""But if you see a bear,"" said Ben, ""you mustn't make any sudden moves or make a sound, and you mustn't run either. No one can run faster in the forest than a bear. And remember we don't have a gun to keep us safe."" That night, we went to sleep ... or we tried to.
The next day, while the others were resting, I went for a walk in the forest. Suddenly, I saw a baby bear playing with some sticks and stones. He looked so soft and friendly, and I thought, ""If I reach out, I can just touch him.""
There was a loud noise behind me.
I didn't dare to move, not even turn my head. There was another loud noise. The baby bear looked up, and ran towards me. I turned pale and he ran past me into the woods.
I couldn't turn round until a few minutes later. Then I saw the baby bear and his huge mother walking away.
I ran back to my friends. I have never run so fast.
For the next 10 days, every time there was sudden noise, my blood went cold.",middle6606.txt
