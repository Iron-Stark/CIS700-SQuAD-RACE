They were good friends, so they often studied and played together. They went to school every day by taxi.
One day one of the boys said, ""There is a test this morning. Let's go to school late. Then we won't have to take the test."" ""What can we tell the teacher?"" One of the boys said. ""He'll be angry. We'll need a good excuse. ""
