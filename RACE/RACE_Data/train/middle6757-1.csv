It was started because there was a mother's Day, and just because some Americans thought that if we had a Mother's Day, we should also have a Father's Day. Father's Day has become important in North America. And businessmen found it was a good way to get people to buy a present for the fathers from their shops.

More and more countries are having Mother's Day, so maybe Father's Day will become popular before too long. Now, what do people in North America do on Father's Day? The newspapers, radios, and TV tell children what they should buy Father's Day presents for their fathers. They even tell a wife to buy a Father's Day present----not for her father but for her husband, even if  he is not a father. And they tell grandchildren to buy a present for their grandfathers.",middle6757.txt
