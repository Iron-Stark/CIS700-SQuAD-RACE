2,D,"['The park refused to send the baby bison back.', 'The visitors saved the baby bison.', 'Many people are angry at the bison family.', 'The smell from humans may bring trouble to bisons.']",Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?,"A wild baby bison   at Yellowstone National Park had to be killed because of tourists.
The tourists thought that the baby bison looked cold. They put it in their car and drove to a park ranger   station.
A ranger described the action of the tourists as a ""dangerous move"" because adult bisons can look after their babies very well and they will attack   to protect their young.
Park rangers took the animal from the car and set it free. But, sadly, the baby was refused by its family because it had the smell from humans.
Yellowstone National Park explained on Facebook that the smell from people can cause parent animals to refuse to accept their young. The park tried again and again to make the baby bison lives with its parents. After several times they had to give up.
Many people expressed anger at both the tourists and the park.
The park said that they did not have the ability to care for a young bison. They also said that it is ""not the task of the park to save animals"".
The tourists were fined   $110 for touching park wildlife. Park rules say that visitors to Yellowstone should stay at least 22 meters away from all wildlife, and at least 90 meters away from bears and wolves.
One ranger said that Yellowstone recently added many safety signs that say staying near the wildlife there is dangerous to humans and animals as well. Those signs are written in English and other languages.",middle7090.txt
