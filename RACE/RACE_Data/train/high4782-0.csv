Smokey Bear has been a recognized symbol of the protection of America's forests from fire. It is created to educate the public about the dangers of wildfires. Smokey Bear was started in 1944 with the slogan, ""Smokey Bear Says--Care will prevent 9 out of 10 forest fires"". Smokey Bear's later slogan,  ""Remember! Only You Can Prevent Forest Fires"", was created in 1947 by the Advertising Council in America. In April 2001, the message was changed to ""Only You Can Prevent Wildfires"".
The wildfire prevention campaign with Smokey Bear is one of the longest and most successful campaigns in advertising history. The Advertising Council often was in partnership with other organizations and groups to create various advertising for Smokey Bear since 1944.

The lovely Bambi also appeared in the advertisements. Mickey Mouse is much more popular throughout the country.

According to recent survey, Smokey Bear and his famous words of wisdom ""Only You Can Prevent Wildfires"" are recalled by 3 out of 4 adults.
