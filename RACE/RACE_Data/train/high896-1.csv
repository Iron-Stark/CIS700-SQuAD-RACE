1,D,"['begin to talk to each other again after a time of silence', 'sit together and become friends very soon', 'know each other and get married', 'clear up a misunderstanding between them']",The author's act of kindness helped the young boy and the girl   _  .,"A few months ago I was at a bus stop in town in the evening. The bus came on time and I took the window seat. The bus was travelling by the seashore and I was enjoying the soft wind while watching the sea waves  . After a few minutes the bus made its next stop. A young boy and a girl got on. They were standing on my left when the bus pulled off. I looked at them in surprise and realized that all the window seats were taken up. They could sit but not together. _ . I got up and offered them my seat. The young lady smiled kindly and said thanks. I took another seat and we parted our ways. I don't remember whether I got off the bus before them or not.
Months passed by. Suddenly one day while I was standing at the same bus stop waiting some time for the bus to arrive I heard a voice.
""Excuse me, Uncle."" I looked in the direction of the voice. It was a beautiful young lady.
Puzzled, I said, ""I do not recognize you.""
She said, ""Do you remember you gave us your window seat?""
Puzzled, I said, ""Maybe, but what is so great in that?""
She said, ""If you had not given your seat that day, perhaps I would have not sat with my friend. By sitting together it helped us bridge a misunderstanding that had been between us forever. Do you know we are getting married next month?""
""Good! God bless both of you,"" I replied.
The young lady again said thank you and went on her journey. I realized the importance of giving that day.",high896.txt
