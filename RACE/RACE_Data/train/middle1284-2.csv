2,A,"['He was not used to children.', 'He was an old man.', 'He lived a long way from the mountains.', 'He had never met Jonny before.']",Why was Uncle Peter worried about Jonny coming to live with him?,"Johnny lived with his mother and father in a small town in the mountains
One day there was an earthquake near the town. Many houses were damaged . Everyone thought that there would soon be another earthquake.
They were worried that the second earthquake would be worse than the first.
""We must send Johnny to a safe place,"" Johnny's mother said to her husband. ""Many of our friends are sending their children to relatives  in other towns,'
""We'll send him to my brother, Peter,"" Johnny's father said. ""He lives a long way away. Johnny will be safe with him.'
He telephoned Johnny's Uncle Peter and asked him if he would let Johnny live with him.
""He's a good boy,"" he said. ""He won't give you any trouble.'
""All right,' Johnny's Uncle Peter said, ""but I'm not used to children. I live a very quiet and peaceful life.""
""You won't know Johnny's in the house,"" his father told him.
So Johnny, who was five, went to live with his uncle.
Two days later, his mother and father received a telegram from Peter.
It said: ""I am returning the child. Please send an earthquake.""",middle1284.txt
