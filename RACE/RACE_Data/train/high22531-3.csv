3,B,"['Opposed .', 'Supportive.', 'Confident', 'Unconcerned']",What's Patti's mother's attitude towards her run?,"At a young age, Patti Wilson was told that she was an epileptic . Her father, Jim Wilson, is  _ . One day she said, ""Daddy, I want to run with you every day, But I'm afraid I'll have a seizure .
    Her father told her, ""If you do, I know how to deal with it, so let's start running!""
    That's just what they did every day. It was a wonderful experience for them to share. And there were no seizures at all while she was running. After a few weeks, she told her father, ""Daddy, I want to break the world's long-distance running record for women.""
    So she did. That year, she wore a T-shirt that read, ""I love epileptics"" and completed her run to San Francisco. Her dad ran every mile at her side, and her mom, a nurse, followed in a car behind them in case anything went wrong.
    In her second year in college, Patti's classmates got behind her. They built a huge poster that read, ""Run, Patti, Run!""
    Her foot was injured when she was running to Portland. A doctor told her she had to stop her run.
    ""Doctor, you don't understand,"" she said, ""This isn't a whim of mine. I'm doing it to let people know -- we can do what others do. Isn't there a way I can keep running?"" ""Yes, but it would be unbelievably painful."" The doctor said. But she told the doctor she could do it.
At last she finished the run to Portland and completed her last mile with the governor of Oregon.",high22531.txt
