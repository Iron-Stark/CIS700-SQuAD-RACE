Many single people say that France's capital is one of the most difficult places to meet people. The complaints of this lonely group have inspired a new phenomenon known as ""supermarket dating."" At Galerie Lafayette Gourmet,singles can shop for more than just the items on their grocery list. They can look for someone who has blue eyes, brown hair,and is 1.8 meters tall,or whatever may be on their romantic shopping list.
At this Paris location,single people of all ages can schedule their shopping for Thursday nights between 6:30 and 9:00 p.m. When they walk through the door,they pick up a purple basket to advise that they are looking for love. They try to arrive early because the baskets disappear quickly, and then they have to wait in line for their turn to wander the store aisles .
With purple baskets in hand, shoppers can consider their romantic options while they pick out their groceries. When they are ready to pay, they can go to the checkout line for singles who want to chat.
Most of the people who look for love in the supermarket are skeptical of Internet dating. They know that it is easy to embellish one's appearance or to lie about one's age over the Internet. The supermarket, on the other hand,is considered a safe and casual environment in which to meet a potential match. In addition, what one finds in another's grocery basket can say a thing or two about that person's character or intentions. Buying pet food can be a man's way of showing a potential match that he has a sensitive side. Women who fill their baskets with low-fat food show their healthy style of living.
