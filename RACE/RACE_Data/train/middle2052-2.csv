2,A,"['Happy but safe surfing.', ""Don't comment on the Internet."", 'Warning about downloads.', 'Activities on the websites.']",What's the best title of this passage?,"Who is reading your blogs or checking out your information online? Two reports show that surfing the Internet and sending personal information to people you do not know could be a problem.
Most sites give users their own webspace where they can write their diaries or post their pictures. The sites encourage users to get their friends to look at their work and to comment on what are posted on the sites.
Teachers are worried that some children are posting their personal information on websites. This could put them at risk from those who plan to do harm to young people. Teachers are also worried some users think it is OK to use the websites in a way that could get others into trouble.
In a school in Illinois in the US where some popular sites are used wildly, the school would punish students who posted pictures or information about smoking , drinking and other illegal activities on the websites.
The school is now going to encourage its 3,200 students to obey a new rule. The warning is clear. That is, be careful when posting information about yourself such as your age, sex, address and interests on a website that anyone can see.
Another warning about the Internet comes from a report. It shows searchers are leading users to websites that show them spam and other dangerous downloads.The words "" free _ "" were found to be the most dangerous words that people search for.
It is well-known that visiting sites offering free MP3s leave users at serious risk. Spyware should be installed on their computers. So, happy surfing ,but remember not to get caught in the Net!",middle2052.txt
