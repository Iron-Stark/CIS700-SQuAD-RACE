0,C,"['Childless couples live a much happier life than those with children.', 'Mothers will be unhealthy because of the postpartum deprdession', 'Couples of young children eat more fatty foods and lead unhealthier lives.', 'Fathers tend to eat high calorie foods because they should run after thrie children.']",What does the author mainly aim to tell us in the passage?,"You'd be forgiven for thinking that running after children each day would leave parents in the best shape of their lives.But a study has found that the mothers and fathers of young children are more unhealthy than their childless peers .
Mothers with young children are heavier and eat more calories and fatty foods,and consume more sugary dinks than chidless women,scientists said.And both sexes are less active than those in their age group without children.
Parents often choose quick,easily preparesd foods that are high in fat and calories,and by choosing these foods they may in turn serve them to their children,forming a cycle of unhealthy diet.
Dr.Berge,one of the study authors,said:""This isn't a study about blame,this is about spotting a very high-risk time period for parents that doctors should be aware of ,so they can offer solutions .""
According to the study ,mothers ate more fatty foods and drank about seven sugary drinks weekly,equal to about four chidless women.They also had an average of 2,360 calories daily,368 calories more than women without children,With that many calorise,women that age would need to be active to avoid to avoid gaining weight.
Fathers ate about the same amount of daily calories childless men and both had an average boby-mass index ,but fathersgot less physical activity--about five hours weekly ,compared to almost seven hours among chidless men.
The study has several limitations-there's no data on how many women reccently had babies.Ther's also no information on the number of single parents,who likely face diet and exercise challenges.Sarah Kriger,an American dietician who works with new mothers said some of the mothers may have had postpartum depression,which might affect their eating and exercise habits.",high12128.txt
