2,C,"['it is fun to take photos for snakes', 'the snake is from London Zoo', 'Jackson has a mobile phone with a camera', 'Jackson was a customer of the restaurant']",It can be inferred from the passage that  _  .,"If a snake bites you, take a photo with your mobile phone! It may save your life. This is the surprising advice of a British cook.
One day Henry Jackson was working in a restaurant kitchen. He picked up a dish from the table, and suddenly a snake appeared... and bit him on the hand.
A few days earlier, the snake came to the restaurant from Asia in a box of bananas. It climbed out of the box and hid under the dish.
""I went to try to pick it up and it bit me again. I threw it across the kitchen, and it landed in the fridge. So I closed the door,"" Mr. Jackson said.
Anyway, Mr. Jackson stayed cool and he took a photo of the snake with his mobile phone. Soon his hand began to ache and he went to hospital. Then his chest began to hurt. Doctors couldn't say what was wrong because they didn't know what kind of snake it was.
Then Mr. Jackson remembered his mobile phone photo. The doctors sent it to London Zoo. When they knew the kind of snake, they could give Mr. Jackson the right medicine, and he left hospital the next day.
""So my advice is this: if a snake bites you, pick up your phone. Take its photo first and then show the photo to the doctors,"" suggests Mr. Jackson. ""Oh, and if the snake doesn't smile for its photo, don't worry.""",middle204.txt
