0,B,"['In a poster.', 'In a magazine.', 'In a storybook', 'In an advertisement.']",Where can we probably read this passage?,"Spending more than two hours a night doing homework leads to better results in English,math and science, according to a major study (by Pam Sammons, England) which has tracked   the progress of3,000 children over the past 15 years.
Spending any time doing homework showed advantages, but the influence was greater for the students who put in two to three hours a night, according to the study published by the Department for Education in England.
The scientists who did the research say their study empbasizes  what students actually do rather than how much work the school has set.
Pam Sammons, a professor of education at Oxford University, said that time spent on homework showed the influence of the school-if children were expected to do homework and if they enjoy their subjects. ""That's one of the reasons Indian and Chinese children do better.They put more time in it."" he added.
It's also reported that students who enjoyed school got better results. ""Schools could make sure children had a better experience by improving the school environment, making school work interesting and making children feel supported by teachers."" Sammons said.
It is suggested that children aged 5 t0 7 should be set one-hour homework a week, half an hour a night for 7 t0 11-year-olds. Secondary schools were encouraged to set up two hours a night for 14 t0 16-year-olds.
