0,D,"['wishes', 'support', 'help', 'thanks']",Allison writes the letter to show   _  to her parents.,"Saturday, March 20, 2010
Dear Mom and Dad,
The time has come: I'm graduating, and I thank you both for all your help during these 15 years. I still remember when you used to say, ""You can be whatever you want"". I'm so glad you are my parents, especially when I hear kids say they don't get on well with theirs. I'm glad that you support me when I decide to do anything. You always try to help, and that's important to me.
Dad, I remember when you first took me fishing. I loved going even though I never caught anything. I also remember when you would get angry with me. I realize you were only trying to show me the right way. When I would cry, you would always be there to try to cheer me up. That's what I call a good, loving, caring dad. Sometimes you and Mom don't agree with me, but you are there by my side in anything that I do, and that's why I love you both so much.
Mom, I enjoy going out with you and having our happy time every Friday night, and I hope that never changes. I love telling you everything; the best part about you is that you listen. I'm glad we do a lot together. You love to have fun, and _ You always give me your opinion and I listen.
Thank you for bringing me up.
Love always,
Allison",middle4205.txt
