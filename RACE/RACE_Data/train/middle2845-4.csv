4,D,"['Wash your hands before meals.', 'When you cough or sneeze,you should cover your mouth and nose with a tissue.', ""You shouldn't often touch your mouth,eyes and nose."", 'When you put a mask,you can often go to the crowded places.']",Which of the statements is Not True?,"The H1Nl virus has been spreading world-wide,it is important for us to know how to control it.Please pay attention to the following points:
1.Don't touch your face.Above all,keep your hands away from your eyes,mouth and nose,all of which serve pathways  for the viruses  to enter your body.
2.Wash your hands.If you have to touch your face,wash your hands,getting under the fingernails for 20 to 30 seconds with hot soap and water before.Soaps with surfactants  can deal with flu viruses.
3.Cover your nose and mouth.When someone sneezes or coughs,liquid  drops with flu viruses as far as three feet through the air and land on your nose and mouth,so it's best to keep at least an arm's length distance when talking to someone who shows signs of infection .In order to protect others,cover your mouth and nose with a tissue  when you cough or sneeze,and clean your hands afterward.Viruses can live for hours,or even longer when on the skin or other surfaces such as keyboards.
4.Consider buying a mask in case you need it in the future.Some research suggests that masks reduce the risk of getting the flu viruses by as much as 80%.But it also suggests that if you don't wash hands,the mask doesn't work well.So wash your hands and use the mask,especially wearing face masks in crowded places is also useful.
