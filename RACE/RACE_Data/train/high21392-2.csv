2,C,"['A Generous Lady', 'A Lucky Beggar', 'Sweet Memories', 'Black Coffee']",What is the BEST title for the passage?,"One day a woman spotted a beggar sitting on the corner. The man was elderly, unshaven and ragged. Passers-by wanted nothing to do with him. But the woman smiled. ""Are you hungry?"" she asked. The man slowly looked up. This was a woman clearly used to the finer things in life. Her coat was new. She looked like that she had never missed a meal in her life. ""No, "" he answered sarcastically . ""I've just come from dining with the president. Now go away. ""To his surprise, the woman continued standing. And her smile became even broader.
    ""What are you doing, lady?"" he asked angrily. ""I said to leave me alone. ""
  Just then a policeman came up. ""Is there any problem, ma'am?"" He asked. 
  ""No problem here, officer,"" the woman answered. ""I'm just trying to get this man to his feet. Will you help me?""
    The officer scratched  his head. ""That's old Jack. He's been around here for a couple of years. What do you want with him?""
    ""See that cafeteria over there?"" She asked. ""I'm going to get him something to eat and get him out of the cold. ""
  ""Are you crazy, lady? I don't want to go in there!"" Then the homeless felt strong hands lift him up. ""Let me go, officer. I didn't do anything.""
    ""This is a good deal for you, Jack, ""the officer answered. ""Don't blow it. ""
    Finally, the woman and the police officer got Jack into the cafeteria and sat him at a table. It was the middle of the morning, so most of the breakfast crowd had already left and the lunch bunch had not yet arrived. The woman turned to the officer, ""Would you like to join us in a cup of coffee and a meal, officer?""
  ""Yes, ma'am. That would be very nice. ""
  Then, she sat down at the table across from her amazed dinner guest. She stared at him. ""Jack, do you remember me?""
  Old Jack searched her face. ""I think so --I mean you do look familiar. ""
  ""I'm Penelope Eddy. I'm a little older perhaps, ""she said. ""In my younger days when you worked here, I came through that very door, cold and hungry. ""
  ""I was just out of college, ""the woman continued. ""I had come to the city looking for a job, but I couldn't find anything. Finally  _ and had been kicked out of my apartment. I walked down the streets, saw this place and came in to see if I could get something to eat. ""
  Jack lit up with a smile. ""Now I remember,"" he said. ""I was behind the serving counter. ""
  ""You made me the biggest roast beef sandwich that I had ever seen and you paid for it out of your own money. ""
  ""I got a job that very afternoon. Eventually I started my own business. ""She pulled out a business card. ""When you are finished here, I want you to meet the personnel director of my company. I'm certain he'll find something for you to do around the office. ""
    There were tears in the old man's eyes. ""How can I ever thank you, ""he said. 
    ""Don't thank me. ""the woman answered. ""Thank the Universe. It led me to you. "" ks5u
    Outside the cafeteria, the officer and the woman paused at the entrance before going their separate ways. ""Thank you for all your help, officer, ""she said. 
  ""On the contrary, Ms. Eddy,"" he answered.  ""Thank you. I saw a miracle today, something that I will never forget. And thank you for the coffee. ""
    She frowned. ""I forgot to ask you whether you take sugar. That's black. ""
    ""Yes. I do. ""the officer said. ""But I don't need it now. I'm sure the coffee you bought me is going to taste as sweet as sugar. """,high21392.txt
