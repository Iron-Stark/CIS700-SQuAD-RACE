2,D,"['To see Alec himself.', ""To see Alec's mother."", 'To confirm that they are of the same family.', 'To make known their relationship and seek help.']",What is Rebecca's real purpose of making this visit?,"A tall figure appeared from the dark door of the tent. It was a smoking young man about twenty three or four. He had an almost black face, though smooth. His moustache was black with curled points. There was an unusual force in his face, and in his daring rolling eyes. cef
Rebecca still stood hesitating like a swimmer about to make his dive, hardly knowing whether to return or move forward.
""Hi, my beauty, what can I do for you?"" said he, approaching. Realizing that she was quite at a loss, the man spoke in a gentle voice, ""Never mind. I am Mr. Thackeray. Have you come to see me or my mother?""
This scene differed greatly from what Rebecca had expected. She had dreamed of an aged and dignified  face. She told herself to be calm and answered ""I came to see your mother, sir.""
""I am afraid you cannot see her-she is ill in bed,"" replied the representative of the house; for this was Mr. Alee Thackeray, the only son of the noble family. ""What is the business you wish to see her about?""
""It isn't business-it is-I can hardly say what!""
""Pleasure?""
""Oh no. Why, sir, if I tell you, it will seem...""

""It is so foolish"", she murmured. ""I fear I can't tell you!""
""Never mind; I like foolish things. Try again, my dear,"" said he kindly.
""Mother told me to come,"" Rebecca continued; ""and, indeed, I was in the mind to do so myself. But I did not expect it would turn out like this. I came...sir, I came to tell you that we are of the same family as you.""
""Ho Ho! Poor relations?""
""Yes.""
""Rossetti?""
""No. Thackeray.""
""Ay, ay; I mean Thackeray.""
""Our names are worn away to Durbeyfield; but we have several proofs that we are Thackeray. The local scholars hold the view that we are, and...and we have an old seal and a silver spoon marked with the same castle as yours. So mother said we ought to make ourselves known to you, as we've lost our horse by a bad accident. We can hardly make a living.""
""It's very kind of your mother, I'm sure."" Alec looked at Rebecca as he spoke, in a way that made her uneasy. ""And so, my pretty girl, you've come on a friendly visit to us, as relations?""
""I suppose I have,"" looking less confident and uncomfortable again.
""Well, there's no harm in it. I mean it doesn't hurt to come and make yourself known to me. Where do you live? What are you?"" ...",high5179.txt
