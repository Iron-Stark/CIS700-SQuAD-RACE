2,C,"['something about an astronomer.', 'where the Milky Way is', 'something about the speedy stars.', 'how scientists do their research']",The writer writes this passage to tell us  _  .,"Think stars don't move? Think again! When you look at the sky at night, the stars may appear to stay in the same place. But stars are always on the move--they are just so far away that the movement is hard to see.
But some stars move in ways that appear to be strange to be real. In 2005, astronomer Warren Brown found one of these space oddities . It was located on the outer edge of the Milky Way, the galaxy  we live in. The star was speeding away like nothing he'd ever seen. ""It seemed unbelievable. No star in the galaxy has a speed like that,"" Brown remembers. ""I thought, oh my goodness, I have something kind of special here.""
No one had ever seen a star like this one. What does a scientist do when the results don't make sense?
Brown didn't give up. Instead, he kept looking. And he kept finding more of these strange and speedy stars, called _ stars. Hyper means ""above"" and velocity has to do with speed. He and his team just found six more of these ""above speed"" stars, bringing to the total of 16. And, he says, he's found even more, and is just waiting for the scientific community to confirm them.",middle350.txt
