1,A,"['Everyone agrees with Darwin now.', 'Darwin was brought up in Shrewsbury.', 'Emma was not really fond of his theory.', 'Darwin was very interested in living things.']",Which of the statements is NOT true based on the passage?,"London: It's well known that Charles Darwin's famous theory of evolution annoyed many people because it was against the Biblical view of creation.

""Emma told him that he seemed to be putting God further and further off"", Padel says in her north London home. ""But they talked it through, and Emma once said, 'Don't change any of your ideas for fear of hurting me.'""
As the world celebrates the 200th birthday of the man who changed scientific thought forever and the 150th anniversary of his book today, even his opponents admitted he was a giant figure.

More than 300 celebrations have been planned in Britain alone, where Darwin's face graces  the 10-pound bill along with that of Queen Elizabeth II.
Shrewsbury, the central England town where Darwin was born and raised, is holding a month-long festival for its most famous son. Down House, his former home near London, will hold a permanent exhibition recreating some of his most famous experiments.
Many more events have been planned all over the world.
