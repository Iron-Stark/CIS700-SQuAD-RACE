3,D,"['Opponents Become Good Friends', 'True Friendship', 'World Top-ranked Badminton Players', 'Who Is a Better Player?']",What is the best title for this passage?,"World top-ranked badminton player Lin Dan said last Friday that he was a better player than Taufik Hidayat in the year of 2006 despite losing the Asian Games single title to the Indonesian Olympic champion.
""I have ranked No.1 in the world for two straight years and I think people can easily come to a conclusion on who is a better player for the whole year,"" said Lin Dan, also known as Super Dan in the badminton world because of his marvelous performance in the sport.
Hidayat beat Lin 21-15, 22-20 to give Indonesia its second gold medal in Doha on December 9, retaining his Asian Games singles title and avenging  two losses to the badminton world champion.
Lin, 23, led China to the men's team title after defeating Hidayat twice in three days, in the preliminary round and in the semifinals of the Asian Games.
In their third meeting, Lin came up against a better-prepared Hidayat than he had encountered previously.
Hidayat was cheered on by the noisy support from dancing and flag-waving Indonesian fans, who had converted the badminton arena into a national celebration even before the two players stepped onto the court.
There's been a lot of acrimony  between Hidayat and Lin, who this year won the single title in the world championships after former champion Hidayat crashed out in the quarterfinals.
In Doha, Hidayat was quoted as calling Lin ""arrogant"" before the event began, but the two stars played down the rift (a situation where two people dislike each other).
""It's no problem, we're close friends,"" said Hidayat. ""The media _ it.""
Lin said last Friday in Beijing that he and Hidayat remain friends despite all the rumors .
""There is no problem between Taufik and me although we don't talk to each other very much,"" said Lin. ""Media tends to make up things in order to make their stories juicy.""",high2225.txt
