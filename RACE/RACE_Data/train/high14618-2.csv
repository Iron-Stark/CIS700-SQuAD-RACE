2,D,"['Friends quarrel with each other.', 'Friends each have grown up.', 'Friends stand apart.', 'One friend ends friendship himself.']",What is the most painful end to a friendship?,"Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver, and the other gold.
This song expresses a nice rule: increasing friends. Sometimes things actually work out that way. I've met adults who've said, ""We've been friends since kindergarten!"" A friend who has known you forever is a treasure. But friendships don't always last -- especially for children.
When I was growing up, my family moved about every three years. The advantage of this was that I got to see different parts of the world, and it made my family very close. I also learned to be pretty good at making new friends, and, to keep in touch with old friends, I became a great letter writer. But I always admired those kids who stayed in one place and kept their friends for a long time. I didn't learn that children's friendships can disappear even when no one moves until I was much older, with children of my own.
Sometimes friendships end in quarrels and hurt feelings. But perhaps the most painful end to a friendship is the one-sided rejection -- one friend turns away, or chooses someone else as a close friend, and the other child is left feeling sad and wondering why this thing happened. The end of a friendship is often sad, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. Often the end of one friendship makes more room for other friendships to grow.",high14618.txt
