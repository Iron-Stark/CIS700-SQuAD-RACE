0,A,"[""Apple announces mobile payment service to replace consumers' wallet."", 'Consumers can pay in cash through mobile phones.', 'Apple Inc. will introduce new models to the market.', 'Mobile payment will be popular soon.']",Which can be the best title for the passage?,"San Francisco(People's Daily Online)-- Apple Inc. Tuesday introduced its mobile payment service Apple Pay alongside the company's iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California.
What apple does is to replace consumers' wallet with its cell phone. Apple said it hopes to speed up the checkout process, make credit-card payments more secure and ultimately, to replace physical wallets.
With the near-field communication technology, Apple's gadgets like iPhone and Apple watch can transmit a radio signal between the device and a receiver when the two are in an inch apart. ""To pay, just hold your iPhone near the contactless reader with your finger on Touch ID. You don't even have to look at the screen to know your payment information was successfully sent,"" Apple says on its official website.
Apple said that each transaction  would be authorized  with a one-time, unique number, creating a security code that it said is more secure than the one on the back of your credit card because cashiers won't see your name, card number or security code. The service will work with the three major payment networks -- American Express, MasterCard and Visa -- and Apple said that there are 220,000 merchant locations that accept these contactless payments.
When some applaud this disrupted service that will compete with Paypal and endanger other online payment companies, some others concern about its safety, especially when another retailer Home Depot confirmed a data opening yesterday and iCloud was reported exposing nude  pictures of celebrities   a week ago.
Leo Zheng, a technology reporter in Silicon Valley said: ""When Apple attracts consumers to put all their cards into one iPhone and promised the security, Jennifer Lawrence should say something.""",high7964.txt
