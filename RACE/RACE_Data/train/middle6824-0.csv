Some people look at seabirds. When they see seabirds fly high out to sea, they say it will be a nice day. When the weather is bad, the seabirds will stay on the shore  . They don't like to fly and they sit in trees when rain is on the way.
Other people look at different animals on a farm. Chickens make a big noise   and run here and there when rain is on the way. Frogs   can tell the weather, too. When rain is coming, they stay in water and make a lot of noise. But on a nice day they are quiet and will jump out of water.",middle6824.txt
