2,A,"['the Ministry of Education supports the reform', 'the reform has started to work in college admissions', 'all the recommended students will be accepted', 'no more than 70% of the people are against the reform']",We can learn from the passage that  _,"Perhaps you do not know your school principal  well . But you might be wise to take him or her seriously . Beijing University will enroll  students recommended by high school principals this year . If the students recommended pass the interviews by Beijing University , they will have 30 extra points added to their national college entrance exam scores if they want to apply to the university.
Beijing University said the reason was a desire to give students with comprehensive or special abilities a chance to stand out .
However , a survey showed 10,046 out of 14,227 people are against the measure . Some experts agree to the criticism . Liu Daoyu , former president of Wuhan University is one strong opponent  . "" There are so many high schools in China . But only 39 schools are allowed to recommend students .""
Is it fair to the rest of the schools in China ? Besides , most of the 39 schools are in big cities , which is more unfair to other regions .""
     The reform is also unfair to other students , some day . According to Liu , in the competitive exam , one extra point can put a student ahead of a large number of others------never mind 30 .
     "" Principals do not know students well . How can they guarantee the recommendation will be fair ?"" asked Wang Xuming , an education expert .
      The Ministry of Education said the move is a good experiment in college admission reforms and the public should support it even if it is not yet mature . It said Beijing University promised a series of supervision  measures to avoid cheating . For example , the information of schools and principals that recommend students , and the recommended students will be put online for a week for public supervision .",high21930.txt
