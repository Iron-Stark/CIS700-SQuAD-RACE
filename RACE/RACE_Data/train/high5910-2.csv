The young man demanded Diaz's wallet, and Diaz passed it over without objection . But just as he turned to walk away, Diaz called, ""Hey, wait a minute. You forgot something.""
The young man turned around, surprised.
""If you're going to rob people for the rest of the night, you might as well take my coat to keep warm.""
The teenager looked at Diaz in disbelief, and asked why he would do such a thing. Diaz replied, ""If you're willing to risk your freedom for a few dollars, I guess you must really need the money.""He said he was heading out for dinner, and that he would be happy to take someone with him.
The young man decided to _ his offer. As they were sitting at the table, the manager, dishwashers and waiters all stopped over to say hello to Diaz, and the young man was amazed at his popularity.
""Haven't you been taught that you should be nice to everybody?""Diaz asked him.
