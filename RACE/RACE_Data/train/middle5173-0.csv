Then it reached a desert,""I went through so many difficulties. I should have no problem crossing the desert,""she thought. As she started, she found herself slowly disappearing into the sand. After many tries, she still failed.
At this time, a deep voice said,""if a breeze   can cross the desert, so can a river.""It was the voice of the desert. But the little stream answered,""that's because a breeze can fly, but I can't.""
""That's because you can't give up what you are. Let yourself evaporate   into the breeze, and _ can take you across,""said the desert.
""Give up what I am now? No! No!""The little stream could not accept this idea.
""The breeze can carry the vapor   across the desert and let it leave as rain. The rain will form a river again,""said the desert.""And whether you're a river or vapor, your nature   never changes.""
Hearing this, the little stream went into the open arms of the breeze. It carried her to the next stage   of her life.",middle5173.txt
