2,C,"['Toyota Camry.', 'Charlie Vansant.', 'Toyota Company.', 'The police.']",Who should be responsible for the accident?----,"Kate Anderson became an accidental car thief when she went to pick up her daughter's car near an Ohio University building last week.Anderson saw the nickelgray Toyota Camry and used her daughter's key to unlock the car,start the engine and drive home.
When Charlie Vansant left class a short time later,he found only an empty parking spot.He first assumed the car had been towed,but when the police couldn't find a record of it,they took a theft report.
The morning after Anderson took back the car,her daughter discovered the Camry in the driveway wasn't hers.She found Vansant's name on paperwork in the glove compartment and looked up his phone number on the Website for the university.
When she told Vansant the car was in her driveway,""It sounded real fishy at first,like maybe she wanted to hold the thing for ransom,""Vansant said!
He eventually went to the house with a police officer,where he was reunited with his car.According to a police report,the case was closed ""because of the mistaken car identity.""Anderson wasn't charged.
Vansant seemed to blame the car company more than the ""thief"".""Her key fit not only my lock,but my ignition as well--so highfive for Toyota,I guess,""he said.
Toyota spokesman Bill Kwong said  key technology wasn't as sophisticated as two decades ago,and there were so many ways to cut a key,making it possible for such a mixup to occur.He said the company now has a microchip embedded in the keys for 90 percent of its vehicles that allows them to start only with the correct key.",high1498.txt
