2,D,"['You should tell others about your bad memory.', 'You should believe in other people all the time.', 'You should ask others to improve their memory.', 'You should be confident in your memory ability.']","What does the sentence ""Never tell yourself that you have a bad memory"" mean?","The human brain weighs about 1.4 kilograms, but it can, hold much more information than most computers. However, there is another difference between humans and computers. Computers don't forget information they are given, but humans often do. No one remembers everything, and luckily we don't usually have to. But everyone can improve their memory if they want to. Here are some suggestions.
* Try to use new information immediately. For example, if you meet someone who says ""Hi! I'm Carlos,"" don't just say ""Hello."" Repeat the person's name. Say"" _ ""
* Break a big number into smaller parts. For example, it's hard to memorize 109244153. But if you break it into three parts--109/244/153--it becomes easier.
*Write out what you need to remember over and over again. This will help you keep it in mind longer, especially for memorizing formulas or facts.
*Always review information. If you bring what you've learned back to your mind, they become easier to remember. For example, before you go to sleep, it's a good idea to review the new things you learned that clay.
* Discuss with a friend. It is always easier to remember things through discussions. You can have a discussion about what's right and what's wrong, and it will lead to the right answer.
*Never tell yourself that you have a bad memory. You can always do something to help improve your memory. And everyone's memory gets better if they use it often enough.
All of the suggestions are helpful. If you follow them, you are certain to improve your memory.",high17221.txt
