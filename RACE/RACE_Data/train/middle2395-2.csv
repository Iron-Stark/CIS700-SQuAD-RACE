2,B,"['about 100', 'about 1000', 'about 200', 'several hundred']",Now I have collected  _   different kinds of bricks.,"I love collecting old paving bricks ( ). It is my favourite hobby. I started it last year when I needed to help our teacher to hold a fair display ( ) for our school. A few years earlier, I read an article about paving bricks in a fashion magazine. I found it was very interesting, so I decided to do the display on the bricks. But we didn't have so many bricks for a good display. Then I decided to go out and look for them.
Now I have collected hundreds of bricks. Most of them are from Ohio ( ). Actually , there are more than one thousand different kinds of bricks in Ohio. Sometimes, I bought some old but special bricks on the Internet. The price is from 5 to 10 dollars for one brick.
Sometimes, people can't understand why I buy bricks. I must say that it's my favourite hobby.",middle2395.txt
