              HOHHOT - China's first direct coal-to-oil project, operated by the country's leading coal producer, Shenhua Group, produced 866,000 tons of oil products last year.
              The direct coal liquefaction line is located in Ejin Horo Banner , Ordos city, North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region. It produces 3,000 tons of oil products by using nearly 10,000 tons of coal per day, said Shenhua Coal Liquefaction and Chemical  Co.,Ltd.
              With an investment of 12.6 billion yuan ($2.06 billion), Shenhua Group began construction of the project in 2004, using self-developed technologies.
              The project began trial production at the end of 2009 with a designed annual capacity of 1.08 million tons of diesel , naphtha and liquefied petroleum gas .
