1,C,"['It was held by MIT.', '11 high schools took part in it.', 'The winner of it must build the best machine.', 'Competing schools were from the United States.']",Which of the following about the competition is TRUE?,"At Carl Hayden High School in Phoenix, Arizona in the United States, four poor Mexican boys worked together on a strange electric machine. They were encouraged by their teacher Allan Cameron to build the machine. It only cost them $800 to build it. They used pipes , cameras, computer parts, and whatever they could find. All the other students wondered what it was. The machine was like a very small submarine . It could move around in a swimming pool. The boys could control  its movement from outside the pool.
Carl Hayden High School had been invited to a competition of high schools and universities. The schools were from the United States and Canada. The school that could build the best machine would be the winner. Many students came from schools that gave them lots of money and support. The Carl Hayden boys had hardly any support and very little money.
Students from eleven schools traveled with their machines to the University of California, including students from the famous university, MIT. When students saw the machine made by the Carl Hayden boys, some of them laughed. Its name was ""Stinky"" because it had a very strong smell. But when the competition started, _ saw that ""stinky"" was no joke. It did better than all the other machines, including the ones from MIT, and it took first place in the competition.
Since then, the boys from Carl Hayden High School have become famous. People have even offered them money for college, and a movie producer has asked them if it is OK to make a movie to tell their story.",middle4369.txt
