4,A,"['Next week.', 'That afternoon.', 'Next year.', 'That week.']",When would Lily's parents come back?,"It was a wet, rainy day during the school holidays. Lily looked out of the window and thought about her parents. They were on a long holiday. They said Lily was too young to go. So Lily was staying with her Aunt Bella. Today Lily was unhappy. She was all alone --Aunt Bella was out shopping.
Lily decided to go to the top floor. Maybe there was something interesting. She arrived at the top. There was an old door. Lily opened the door and walked in. The walls were changing colours. A sofa wasn't on the floor! It was in the air. Suddenly she heard a sound ""Whoooosh"" and after a minute she saw a boy appear .
""Hi,"" he said. ""I am the genie . Who are you?""
""I'm Lily,"" she answered, ""but you don't look like a genie.""
The boy looked at her. He said, ""Hocuspocusinversus!"" And then suddenly Lily was in the air. ""OK! I believe you,"" she shouted. ""Get me down!""
""So, how many wishes do you want?"" the boy said.
Then she told the cool genie she was lonely. She told him about having no friends. The cool genie just nodded his head . When Lily finished her story, she felt better.
The genie said, ""Well, I must go now!"" Then suddenly he was gone. Lily went downstairs  and found a postcard from her parents. It said, ""Dear Lily. Miss you, back next week, love Mom and Dad."" Then the front door opened and she heard Aunt Bella arriving with her shopping.
The next day Lily decided to say ""Thank you"" to the genie. She went to the top floor and opened the door. But there was nothing there except a dark old room with a few boxes.",middle4731.txt
