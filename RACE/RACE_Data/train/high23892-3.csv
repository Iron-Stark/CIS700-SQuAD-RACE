I noticed him because not many people wear a jacket and tie in the middle of a hot summer day, and I had already seen this man four times that afternoon.
To make sure he was following me, I walked on quickly, turned right into a shopping center and then stopped to look in a shop window.  Soon the man appeared and stopped at another shop window. I walked on and stopped several times. When I stopped , he stopped too.
I began to be rather worried and decided to try to lose this strange man.  When I saw a taxi coming, I jumped into it. As I was telling the taxi driver where to go, I found the man get into another taxi, which then followed mine. As the two taxies slowly made their way alongOrchard Road, I looked back at the taxi behind, and saw that the stranger was looking out at me. At MRT station, I told the taxi driver to stop and I got out. As I was paying my fare, I saw the man was getting out of his taxi.
By now I got angry, so I turned and walked straight to him.  I asked him why he was following me. At first he said he was not following me at all, but when I threatened  to call the police, he admitted he was.
