3,A,"['A Scientist.', 'A teacher.', 'A farmer.', 'An artist  .']",What did Qian Xuesan work as?,"My favorite physicist   is Qian Xuesen. He was born in Shanghai on December 11, 1911. He was a little fat and of medium height. And his eyes were wise. He liked music, art and science  .
He studied the important implementation   plan for the Chinese rocket   and the missile  . He worked very hard for our country. I liked him very much.
Qian Xuesen had famous words: I am very tiny  . It is the Chinese people that are truly great!
Qian Xuesen died on October 31, 2009. I'm very sad to hear the news, and Chinese people are the same as me. He is our hero. We should learn from him and I think I won't forget the great scientist for ever.",middle1814.txt
