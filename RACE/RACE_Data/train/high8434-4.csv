4,C,"['Tom McClean was the first person to set foot on Rockall', 'Hancock will rely on his large support team', 'Rockall is not suitable for humans to settle on', 'Hancock was already a famous online writer before making the plan']",We can learn from the passage that  _  .,"Nick Hancock hopes to set a new record by living alone for 60 days on a small island in the Atlantic.
Tom McClean, an SAS soldier who holds the solo record for occupying  Rockall for 40 days in 1985, told Hancock that being alone for two months was the greatest challenge Hancock would have to face.
""I'm fully expecting it to be tough,"" Nick Hancock said. ""I'm hoping that by doing my daily tasks fairly slowly, I'm going to be able to keep most of my time busy. I think the worst times will come if I'm boxed up for several days by bad weather.""
Hancock hopes to land on Rockall in early June and will carry out the last tests of his boat next week. He has a small wind turbine  and a solar panel for power, more than two months' food, a satellite phone and a laptop loaded with e-books to keep him going. Hancock will update an adventure blog, texting messages out on Twitter and emailing his wife Pam and friends every day.
Rockall has been occupied before, most famously by McClean but also by three Greenpeace campaigners, who set the long-stay record of 42 days in 1997 by occupying the rock in protest at oil and gas exploration in the area.
The last human inhabitants Hancock knows of are a small group of Belgian amateur radio enthusiasts, who are interested in broadcasting from distant islands; they were on Rockall overnight in late 2010.
Hancock has no large support team behind him. Except for the coastguard , his only lifeline will be the Orca III, the passenger boat which will take him to Rockall.",high8434.txt
