0,D,"['row 13 is replaced with 12 A', 'there is no gate 13', 'passengers complain that there is 13 dots on its logo', 'none of their planes have row 13']","When you go aboard the Ryan Air, you will probably find that_.","A failed plot to kill Barack Obama, uncovered by US federal agents recently, has reminded people of the ideas that some humans associate with simple numbers.
    Two white American Neo-Nazi racists   had planned to kill 88 African Americans, before finally assassinating   Obama. The number ""88"" is equated with ""HH"", initials   for the Nazi greeting, ""Heil Hitler"". ""H"" is the eighth letter of the alphabet .
Many people were not familiar with the Neo-Nazi importance of 88, but associations attached to other numbers are more well-known, if not always believed. The number 13, for instance, is considered deeply unlucky.
    In the US, many buildings do not have a floor numbered 13. They instead label it 12A, or use the letter M, which is the 13th letter in the English alphabet. New York's John F. Kennedy International airport does not have a gate number 13. And the popular Irish flight carrier, Ryan Air, has banished   row 13 from all its planes.
    Last year when Brussels Airline put 13 dots in their new logo, the flood of complaints was so vast the airline was forced to change their ""unlucky logo"" and add an additional dot.
    The fear comes from a Bible story, which states that Judas Iscariot, the disciple   who betrayed   Jesus, was the 13th to sit at the table in the Last Supper.
    But the most fascinating fear of the number relates to Friday the 13th. It's a day of double bad luck. In the US, many people would not schedule a wedding for Friday the 13th. According to the Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute in the US, an estimated 17 to 21 million Americans are affected by a fear of this day.",high17938.txt
