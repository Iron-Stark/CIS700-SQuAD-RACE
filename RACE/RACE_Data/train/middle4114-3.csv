You should say ""thank you"" when someone passes you the salt on the table or opens the door for you, or say you have done your homework well.  ""Thank you"" is used not only between friends but also between parents and children, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives.
""Excuse me"" is another useful short expression. When you hear someone say so behind you, you know he or she wants to walk past you without touching you.
