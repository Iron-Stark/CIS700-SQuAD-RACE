1,B,"['looks Norman', ""doesn't tell riddles"", 'is not angry with him', 'is usually quiet during dinner']","During dinner, Keith is relieved because T.J   _  .","The longest day of the month is the day after my younger brother T.J gets his new issue of Just Joking , a magazine filled with all kinds of jokes. When the new issue arrives, T.J tells me every riddle in it . But a constant stream of riddles can get annoying .
""Hey, Keith ! What did he hamburger name his daughter ?""
  ""T.J !"" I shout . ""Enough riddles !""
He is suddenly quiet.
""Keith , be nice ,""Mom says. ""T.J, honey, what did the hamburger name his daughter?""
""Patty,"" he says.
During dinner ,T.J doesn't say anything . Usually he brings Just Joking to the table with him and tells us some riddles in between bites of food .This evening, he does not .I'm relieved . At last --- some peace and quiet.
After dinner, I go to my friend Brad's house to work on a project for science class . We're painting the planets when Brad's little sister, Nita, comes into the room.
""Brad, can I help you with the project ?"" Nita asks.
""Nita !"" He shouts at her . ""Leave us alone!""
Nita walks out of the room looking sad. I feel bad for her. I can tell that she just wants to be around her big brother. The look on Nita's face reminds me of the look on T.J's face earlier in the evening . Now I don't feel so good about T.J's silence at the dinner table.
When Brad and I finish working on the project, I see Nita in the front of the room .She still looks sad.
""Hey, Nita! Do you know what the hamburger named his daughter ?"" I ask.
""I don't know. What?"" Nita says.www.ks5u.com
""Patty!""
Nita laughs and I laugh too . "" I heard that from my brother, T.J,"" I say. ""He's very funny.
When I get home, T.J still looks unhappy.
""T.J, guess what ?"" I say. "" I used one of your riddles tonight. Brad's little sister thought it was really funny. So let's find more riddles for the next time I go over there. And maybe you can come along with me sometime.""
""Really ?"" T.J's eyes light up . ""OK!"" T.J runs upstairs, and then comes back, smiling and carrying Just Joking.",high17052.txt
