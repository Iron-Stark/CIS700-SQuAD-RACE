2,C,"['lost 98.8 percent of their DNA shared with chimps', 'needed very good memories to survive', 'gained skills but also lost skills', 'learned to compete against chimps']","During evolution, humans   _  .","Do you have a good memory? Maybe you remember better than all of your friends. But even if you have a short-term memory, it's better than a chimpanzee's , right? Well, you may be wrong.
Tetsuro Matszawa, a scientist from Kyoto University, Japan has showed how chimps have far better memories than humans. ""We learn that chimps have great memories by doing tests,"" he told The Guardian ""You can do things to improve your memory.""
How do chimps have better memories than us? Scientists tested four chimps and human volunteers. They showed them five numbers on a computer screen. Chimps and human volunteers had to remember the numbers correctly. But to make it hard, the numbers disappeared  after seven tenths of a second. Then they will reduce  the time to two tenths of a second. While humans began to make mistake after mistake, the young chimps still did very well.
Why do they have better memories? We share 98.8 percent of our DNA with chimps. But during evolution , we lost some of our shared abilities. As humans learned new skills, like language, we had to lose some of our memory skills to make room in our brains. ""To get something, we had to lose something,"" said the scientist.
Chimps need good memories to survive . When a chimp looks up at the big tree and pick a banana, he must remember where he saw it as he fights off competition from other animals.",middle5681.txt
