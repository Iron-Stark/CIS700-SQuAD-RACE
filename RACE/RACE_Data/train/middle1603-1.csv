1,C,"['turning off lights', 'shutting down computers', 'turning up CD players', 'turning off TV']",We may use more electricity by  _  .,"When you watch TV and play video games you make global  warming worse! It may seem hard to believe, but when electricity is made, so are greenhouse gases . This means that every time you use electricity you help make global warming worse!
Cars are also making global warming worse. They burn fossil fuels  in their engines, and send lots of greenhouse gases into the air.
Global warming may be a big problem, but we can all help stop it. People can try to drive their cars less. Or even get ones that run on sunlight! You can also help. Let's try one of these top ideas:
(1) Try to use less electricity. Turn off lights, your television, and your computer when you've stopped using them. To make electricity, fossil fuels are burned in big factories. But burning fossil fuels also makes greenhouse gases. You should also try to watch less TV.
(2) Plant trees. Not only is it a fun thing to do, but it is also a great way to lower the number of greenhouse gases in the air. Trees take carbon dioxide out of the air when they grow.
(3) Don't throw away your rubbish, try to recycle it. If rubbish is not recycled, it is put in the ground. There it rots  and makes a greenhouse gas called methane .So try to recycle cans, bottles, plastic bags and newspapers. It'll make you feel great! And it'll help the Earth.",middle1603.txt
