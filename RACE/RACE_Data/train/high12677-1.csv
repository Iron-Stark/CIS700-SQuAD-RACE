The first gallery opened in the summer of 1997. In December of 1998 a second gallery opened. Both of these galleries are organized by the Airport Art Program and Georgia Art Education Association(GAEA). The GAEA aims to improve the conditions of teaching art across Georgia. They organize meetings for art students to improve their skills and provide exhibition chances for them to show their artwork. They also hold meetings twice a year for teachers.
