4,D,"['Specialists are more expensive to hire than generalists.', 'Formal schooling is less important than job training.', 'On-the-job training is, in the long run, less costly.', 'Generalists will do better than specialists in management.']",Which of the following statements does the author support?,"If you know exactly what you want, the best way to get a job is to get specialized training. A recent survey shows that companies like graduates in such fields as business and health care who can go to work immediately with very little on-the-job training.

Time and again labor-market analysts mention a need for talents that liberal-arts majors are assumed to have: writing and communication skills, organizational skills, open-mindedness and adaptability, and the ability to analyze and solve problems. David Birch, manager of the Boston Red Sox, claims he does not hire anybody with an MBA or an engineering degree, ""I hire only liberal-arts people because they have a less-than-canned way of doing things,"" says Birch.
For a liberal-arts degree, students focus on some basic courses that include literature, history, mathematics, economics, science, human behavior--plus a computer course or two. With these useful and important courses, you can feel free to specialize, ""A liberal-arts degree coupled with an MBA or some other technical training is a very good combination in the marketplace,"" says Scheetz.",high15898.txt
