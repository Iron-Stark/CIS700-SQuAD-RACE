1,D,"['only for three minutes', 'for an hour', 'in the evening', 'at any time']",People in Britain can watch TV news   _   every day.,"There are 5 channels on British television and each channel has several news programs all day long. Some programs are only for 3 minutes but some are one hour long. The people who read the news are called news presenters and because they appear on television every day, they are very famous.
This is a popular news presenter in England called Trevor McDonald, in the news studio. He presents a program called ""News at Ten""every Monday to Friday evenings.
Another popular news presenter is Kirsty Young. She has a more modern style of reading the news, as you can see, she sits on the desk not on a chair!
Television news presenters need to have worked as journalists because they have to write most of the news that they read. Sometimes an important new event happens after the program has started, so the presenter has to be able to read something without looking at it first. They must always keep calm even when there are many changes during the program. At the end of ""News at Ten""Trevor McDonald says ""And finally..."". Then he reads an unusual or interesting item. It's a famous saying in England now.",middle1277.txt
