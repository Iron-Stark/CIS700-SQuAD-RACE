3,B,"['Make gifts.', 'Help cook dinner.', 'Clean up the houses.', 'Go to an animal shelter.']",What will Megan do next week?,"I often walk dogs at an animal shelter  near our house. When they see me, they look so happy, because they know they will get to go outside, play with me and get lots of love from me.

Every weekend, I go to an animal shelter to help. They have adoption events at pet stores. I help out by talking to people about animals, feeding animals and making sure the cages are clean. It makes me feel great when a cat or dog gets a new home.

Sometimes I do things for my neighbors and ask them to give me some money or clothes. Then I can give these to the unlucky people.

I love volunteering! Last week, I cleaned up the houses for people who couldn't do it themselves. I also made gifts for many women on Mother's Day. And I'll help the older people cook dinner next week. I love the feeling I get when the people smile and I know I made a difference in their life.

I volunteer at an after-school reading program. I help young children to learn how to read. My favorite part of it is seeing a little child feels excited when he or she learns a new word.
