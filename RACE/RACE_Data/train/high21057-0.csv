    At the Beijing Comic and Animation Expo last week, that's exactly who Shi Jia was. The Senior 1 girl was cosplaying ""Curarpikt"", a character from the popular Japanese comic book Hunter X Hunter (<<>> ) by Yoshihiro Togashi.
    ""I cosplay Curarpikt because I like him,"" said the pretty 15-year-old girl. ""I'm moved by his sad story and I'm attracted by his courage and personality.""
    In the adventure comic story, Curarpikt, a handsome and kind-hearted boy, struggles to become a hunter so he can capture the people who killed his tribe.
    Shi has read all the comic books and is a big fan of the animated series of Hunter X Hunter. Then last year she saw a real ""Curarpikt"" in a cosplay show.
    ""I had watched cosplay shows before but only for fun,"" she explained. ""It's really exciting to see young people wearing the make up and costumes of characters that you've read about and are familiar with.""
    ""But that time I just fell in love with cosplaying, probably because I like Curarpikt so much. I thought I could play the character better, so I decided to have a go.""
    Shi bought some cloth and asked a tailor to make a Curarpikt costume for her. She was delighted to find out there was a cosplay show in Beijing in October.
    ""It's a great way to spend the national holiday. Posing on the stage for all the comic book fans, I knew I was doing something I had always wanted to do,"" she said.
    But she never talks about her hobby with her parents.
    ""They think it will distract me from my studies. I don't want to upset them, that's my secret hobby,"" she said. ""It's also why I don't dye my hair for cosplaying like all the others.""",high21057.txt
