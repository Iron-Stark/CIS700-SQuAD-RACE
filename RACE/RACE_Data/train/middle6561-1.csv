In 1961, a man found a strange cat on his farm in Scotland. The cat's ears were folded  , bent   forward, on its head. In fact, this was a new kind of cat. People named it the ""Scottish Fold"".
The Scottish Fold has a round head and big eyes. Its neck and legs are short. They make it look very lovely. Interestingly, all the Scottish Folds are born with straight and unfolded ears. And when they are growing up day by day, some cats' ears will begin to fold. So, the Scottish Fold comes in two types: folded ears and straight ears.
There is a nickname for the Scottish Fold. It is the ""Messenger of Peace"". Why? Because the Folds are sweet and friendly animals. They can _ with other cats. And unlike some other cats, they can even get along well with dogs! In many different places, for example, at a noisy house or in a cat show, you can see them playing with other animals happily.
Well, when you come to a new school, do you think it's difficult to feel comfortable in the new place? Perhaps you can learn from the Scottish Fold, which is always sweet and friendly to others.",middle6561.txt
