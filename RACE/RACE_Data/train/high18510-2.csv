2,B,"['Rich and shy.', 'Wise and sincere.', 'Proud and poor.', 'Naughty and wise.']",Which of the following words can best describe the young man?,"Once there was a rich,beautiful and wise princess.Tired of those who were only interested in her money,she said that she would only marry whoever managed to present her with the most valuable and sincere gift of all.
Soon the palace was filled with gifts of every kind.Among all these gifts,she found a simple dirty stone.She wondered who had offered this gift.She pretended   to be very angry because of the gift when the young man was brought before her. He explained,""Dear Princess,this stone stands for the most valuable thing one can give---- it is my heart.It is also sincere.And because it is not yet yours,it is as hard as a stone.Only when it is filled with love will it become softer than any other thing.""
The young man quietly left,leaving the princess surprised.She was so in love that she took the little stone with her wherever she went.And for months she gave the young man gifts and all her attention.But his heart remained as hard as the stone in her hands.Losing hope,she ended up throwing the stone into a fire. Then in the heat of the fire,the stone became a golden figure .Then the princess understood that she herself would have to be like fire.
During the following months,she contributed her life, her wisdom and her wealth to her country.And the people started to call her the ""Princess of Fire"".
And,as with the stone,the Princess of Fire melted the hardness of the young man's heart.And, just as he had promised,he became so soft that he made the princess happy till the end of her days.",high18510.txt
