1,C,"['They expect too much of Sara.', 'They put lots of pressure on Sara.', 'They love their daughter very much.', 'They advise Sara to make more friends.']",What do we know about Morn and Dad from the letter?,"Dear Sara,
As we drove off from Columbia,I wanted to write a letter to you to tell you all that is on my mind.First,I want to tell you how proud we are.Getting into Columbia College shows what a great well-rounded student you are.Your academic,artistic,and social skills have truly blossomed in the last few years.Whether it is getting the highest grade in mathematics,completing your elegant fashion design,successfully selling your painted running shoes,or becoming one of the top speakers in Model United Nations,you have become a talented and accomplished young woman.You should be as proud of yourself as we are.
College will be the most important years in your life.It is in college that you will truly discover what learning is about.This will be the period where you go from teacher-taught to master-inspired,after which you must become self-learner.So do take each subject seriously,and even if what you learn isn't critical for your life,the skills of learning will be important to you forever.
Follow your passion in college.Take courses you think you will enjoy.Don't be trapped in what others think or say.Do your best in classes,but don't let pressure get to you.Your mother and I have no expectations for your grades.If you graduate and learn something in your four years,we would feel happy.So please don't give yourself pressure.
I told your mom I'm writing this letter,and asked what she wanted me to say.She thought and said:""Just ask her to take care of herself.""Please listen to your mother and take care of yourself.
So please treasure your college years,make the best of your free time,and become an independent thinker;learn and grow through your successes and challenges.
Love,
Dad(& Mom)",high13935.txt
