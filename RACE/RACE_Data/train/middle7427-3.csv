3,C,"['Angry.', 'Excited.', 'Sorry.', 'Doubtful.']",How might the father feel after he knew the troth?,"He found the boy's father in the hall waiting worriedly.
On seeing him, the father cried out, ""Why did you take all this time to come? Don't you know that my son is in danger? Don't you have any sense of duty?""
The doctor smiled and said, ""I am sorry. I wasn't in the hospital and I came as fast as I could after receiving the call and now, I wish you'd calm down so that I can do my work.""
""Calm down?! What if your son was in this room right now? Would you calm down? If your own son dies while waiting for a doctor, then what will you do?"" said the father angrily.The doctor smiled again and replied, ""We will do our best and you should also pray  for your son's healthy life.""
The surgery took some hours after which the doctor went out happy, ""Thank goodness!Your son is saved!"" And without waiting for the father's reply he carried on his way running by saying, ""If you have any questions, ask the nurse.""
""Couldn't he wait some minutes so that I can ask about my son's state?"" shouted the father when seeing the nurse minutes after the doctor left.
The nurse answered, tears coming down her face. ""His son died yesterday in a road accident. He was at the burial   when we called him for your son's surgery. And now that he saved your son's life, he left running to finish his son's burial.""
