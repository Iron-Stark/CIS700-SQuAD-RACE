3,B,"['About five minutes.', 'About fifteen minutes.', 'About half an hour.', 'About fifty minutes.']",How long does it take a woman to change herself at least?,"One of the problems career people  have in the morning is dressing for the office when there will be an evening party immediately followed, with no time to return home to change. The easiest solution is to keep a full set of toiletries   and make-ups stored somewhere at the office. A woman going to an evening party should dress in one of her ""basic dresses"" in the morning--the kind that can change into a different look with an added scarf or jewelry. In fifteen minutes, when her office day has ended, she can metamorphose  herself into another person with freshly cleaned teeth, combed hair, a new face, a different and dressier  pair of shoes, and some sparkling jewelry. If she must wear a long dress for the party, she should bring it to the office in a protective bag and store it safely until she has to put it on.",middle910.txt
