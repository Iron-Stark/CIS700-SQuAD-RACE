1,D,"['Happy.', 'Sad.', 'Pleased.', 'Surprised.']",How did the writer's sister feel when she saw the son was angry with his mother?,"Children should be allowed to get angry. I remember many years ago, when I was visiting my sister in Australia, and I told my oldest son that he wasn't allowed to do something he really wanted to do. He thought about it for a minute and said, ""Mom, I'm very angry with you."" I replied, ""That's OK, darling, it's what you do with your anger."" I then asked him if he wanted to talk to me about it but he was too angry to talk to me. Then he stormed off .
My sister looked at me surprisingly. Now she has a son the same age as mine and she said angrily, ""How can you allow your child to be angry with you? If my son learns that from you, I will never forgive you.""
Then it was hard for me to stay with her, I ended up leaving earlier. Why shouldn't my son have the right  to tell me when I have made him angry? If he can't tell me then how can he tell others in his life?
Children need to be able to express how they feel. We need to teach them ways to do this in a right way instead of saying nothing. I want them to tell me. _ anger is not healthy for anyone and usually makes things worse.",middle7367.txt
