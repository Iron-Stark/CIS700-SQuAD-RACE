2,A,"['after the old man died', 'when the nurse sensed something strange', ""before the sailor came to the nurse's station"", ""when holding the old man's hand""]",The young sailor told the nurse that he was not the real son of the old man  _   .,"The story began on a downtown Brooklyn street corner. An elderly man had fallen down while crossing the street , and an ambulance rushed him to the nearest hospital. There, when he came to now and again, the old man repeatedly called for his son.
From a worn letter located in his pocket, an emergency-room   nurse learned that his son was a sailor stationed in North Carolina Camp. Obviously there were no other relatives.
Someone at the hospital called the Red Cross office in Brooklyn, and a request for the son to rush to Brooklyn was sent. Because time was short--the patient was dying, so they found the young man and rushed him to the airport in time to catch the only plane that night enable him to reach his dying father.
It was dusk when the nurse took the tired, anxious sailor to the bedside. ""Your son is here,"" she said to the old man. She had to repeat the words several times before the patient's eyes opened. The medicine he had been given because of the pain from his heart attack made his eyes weak and only saw the young man in uniform( ) standing outside the oxygen tent. He extended his hand. The sailor wrapped his strong fingers around the old man's, releasing a message of love and encouragement. The nurse brought him a chair, so the sailor could sit by the bed.
Nights are long in hospitals, but all through the night the young sailor sat there, holding the old man's hand and offering words of hope and strength. It was nearly dawn when the patient died. The sailor placed his lifeless hand he had been holding on the bed, and went to inform the nurse.
""Who was the man?"" the sailor asked.
""He was your father."" the nurse answered surprisingly.
""No, he wasn't,"" the sailor replied."" I never saw him before in my life.""
""Why didn't you say something when I took you to him?"" she asked.
""I knew immediately there'd been a mistake, but I also knew he needed his son, and his son just wasn't here. When I realized he was too sick to tell whether or not I was his son, I guessed he really needed me. So I stayed.""
Two days later a message came in that there had been two sailors with the same name and similar number in the Camp. Someone in the personnel office had pulled out the wrong record.
But _ And he proved, in a very human way, that there are people who care what happens to their fellow men.",high9850.txt
