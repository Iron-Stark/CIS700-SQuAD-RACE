The 14-year-old and her family had traveled by plane from Canton, Ohio. Now, as they approached the village, hundreds of cheering schoolchildren lined the entrance to the Hoa Lac School, a two-story concrete building that Carly had raised money for.
    Carly started helping others at eight, handing out Thanksgiving baskets at church to families in need. It was a snowy day, and she saw many girls didn't have warm coats. The next November, she went door to door asking for used coats, hats, gloves and scarves, and then handed them out with the baskets.
   But Carly wanted to do more. She remembered her grandmother's Rotarv Club ("""") had, years earlier, raised money to build a school in Vietnam. That was what she now wanted to do.
   At 12, she began to raise money for Vietnamese children with a PowerPoint presentation. ""The kids in rural Vietnam don't have decent schools. I want to give them a place to make their lives better,"" she told a room of 200 Rotarians.
  That summer, Carly set off with her family across Ohio, visiting three or four Rotarv Clubs a week. ""We traveled like crazy people to all these meetings,"" recalls her mother, Kris.
   At first they got no donations. But one night, Carly and her dad, Fred, pulled up to a building in Minerva, Ohio. Carrying a laptop, a projector and a screen, they walked into a bar where 15 people were sitting around a long table. There was dead silence after Carly finished her presentation. Fred thought that was never going to work. Then someone made a motion: ""Let's give this girl check right now."" Minutes later, Carly walked out with her first donation: $500.
   Not everyone was  _ about the idea of helping Vietnam. ""Why should we help it?"" asked one veteran  . Carly replied simply, ""They're kids. And I'm just a kid who wants to help out.""
   As word spread, individual donors sent checks for as little as $5. A restaurant chain contributed $1,000. Carly's coach organized a tournament that netted $4,000. A bible camp bought 500 backpacks for the children. In two years, Carly raised $50,000.",high20930.txt
