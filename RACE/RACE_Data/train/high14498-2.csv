2,A,"['giving explanations', 'giving examples', 'listing number', 'following the natural time order']",The author develops the passage mainly by   _  .,"I'm a travel lover. I think it is very exciting to go to new places, experience different situations and see new things. Here's what I have come up with about why my travel is so interesting.
To start with, whether we know it or not, every day is filled with anxiety about things that we don't need to worry about in the first place. Going to new places is a good chance to escape from our everyday worries. For example, after a whole day at work, I'm often physically and mentally tired and start to worry about things. However, the moment I get on the train or bus to my next destination  I forget all my tiredness and worries.
Next is one of the most important things in travel: movement. I always take along books to read on my train trips, but in the end, only about five pages or so ever get read, because I just look at things out of the window. Just the ability to move is very enjoyable. Movement also means that we are going to new places and seeing new things. But why is that important? Because experiencing new situations, people and ideas can help us to learn about new things and grow. I have never gone on a trip and come back as the same person; I have always changed and grown through travel.
So take every type of trip you can, at every chance you get, and you will not only experience more of the world, but will become a happier person with rich experiences.",high14498.txt
