1,A,"['Ruth and Joshua.', 'Pauline and Frank.', 'Richard and Stuart.', 'Joshua and Ben.']","According to the passage, which of the following names are better?","What's in a name? Well, apparently, our general happiness. Psychologists say that what we are called has a direct connection with our well-being  . 
     Those called Judy and Joshua are the happiest, while Lynn or Ben is likely to be the unhappiest, according to research. Psychologist Dr David Holmes found that this might due to the association that others made with the name. Hearing the name Judy may make them think of actress Judi Dench or TV presenter Judy Finnigan, people who are seen as good natured and happy. On the other hand, people think Paulines are unhappy because of the character Pauline Fowler from the TV programme East Enders. The research claims that this association influences the person with the name and so their personality becomes shaped to fit it. Dr David Holmes said, ""This also has some relation with the original meaning of the name. For example, the original meaning of Judy is 'praised'.""
     Certain names also work well in certain aspects of life. In the workplace Richard and Judy are happiest, while those called Ruth and Carly are happiest in relationships. At the other end of the scale the unhappiest workers are Stuart and Liz, with the unhappiest in relationships being Frank and Harriet. 
       Dr Holmes said, ""The relation we have with certain names, particularly important namesakes , also shapes how we see ourselves and so may have an effect on our confidence. Names are like product brands in having a powerful effect on attitudes and should therefore be chosen with care.""
      ""Other names are connected with being brave, outgoing or serious. Therefore, many celebrities change their names to ones which reflect these characteristics. This, in turn, influences parents when they choose names for their babies,"" said Dr Holmes, ""however, names connected with ordinary people are seldom chosen for their babies"".",high859.txt
