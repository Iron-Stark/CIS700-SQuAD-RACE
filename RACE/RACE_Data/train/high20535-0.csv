0,D,"['The Australian Open.', 'The French Open.', 'The Wimbledon Open.', 'The US Open.']",Which of the following tournaments is the last to be held?,"Beautifully cut grass, elegant   white clothes, cheering fans and exciting matches make Wimbledon, in London, the home of tennis.
    Last Monday, the famous British tournament   opened at the All England Lawn Tennis Club. It is the third Grand Slam tournament of the tennis season. Wimbledon comes after the Australian Open and the French Open, and is followed by the US Open.
    As the oldest tennis tournament in the world, Wimbledon is famous for its special rules and traditions. The players' clothing, including their shoes, must be entirely white.
    In 2002, the Russian player Anna Kournikova was forced to change from her black shorts into another pair on court. Between 1988 and 1990, US legend Andre Agassi refused to play because of the all-white rule.
    The UK's unpredictable summer weather is part of the tournament. If it begins to rain, players and fans have to wait patiently for it to stop. Then, they cheer when the covers come off the grass courts.
    Many British fans do not think the courts should have a roof, because they want to keep tradition.
    Wimbledon is not just famous for great tennis matches. Fans like to eat strawberries and cream while watching. Every year 27,000 kilos of strawberries and 7,000 liters of cream are eaten.
    Many British people are very proud of the tournament, but disappointment is another Wimbledon tradition for loyal   fans of British players. Wimbledon has not been won by a British woman since 1977, and not by a British man since 1938.",high20535.txt
