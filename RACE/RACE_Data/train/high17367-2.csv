2,D,"[""Foreign festivals can make Chinese shop owners' pockets full quickly."", 'The food at foreign festivals is too simple', 'Chinese festivals always have something to do with culture.', 'Foreign festivals are romantic while traditional Chinese ones are connected with reality']",What is the main difference between foreign festivals and traditional Chinese ones?,"Nowadays,people in China are increasingly interested in celebrating foreign festivals,especially those western festivals.
    A survey conducted recently by sina.com showed that among the 18,222 people surveyed 63.90%said celebrating Christmas is just another way of recreation,nothing serious while 17.85%surveyed considered the festival as a fashion act.showing they were not ""out"".These two parts clearly indicate the general opinion of the young.10.45%people involved said the celebration of a religious western festival with so much enthusiasm is  ly ridiculous pursuit of foreign goodness.Only 7.80%of people define Christmas as a kind of festival colonization 
    The arising of celebrating foreign festivals clearly has something to do, with the advancement of China's economy.In my point of view.Christmas and other festivals celebrated in China have difference from the origin.They have lost their religious background and turned into a big occasion to have fun and enjoy life.Shop owners' pockets are filled,the public's hunger for happiness is filled,and that is enough.Foreign festivals in China are more like carnivals giving people pleasure and enjoyment.
    The crisis of traditional Chinese festivals that are losing their attraction may be linked to the culture tradition and background of the festivals.Most Chinese festival culture is related more or less to real life ""The country is based on its people while the people are relied on their food"".
    But the western culture shows much of romance.Some festivals have their religious background while others have much to do with culture and people.At this point,food seems to be too plain.Flowers and chocolates are more welcomed.
    Foreign festivals in China today are celebrated for fun.They give people opportunities to relax mad celebrate,to show appreciation and gratefulness.The acceptance of foreign festivals generally depends on the openness of the public,the familiarity with the western culture,and most importantly,on people's economic status.",high17367.txt
