2,B,"['Chinese families will go to the cinema together', 'there may be more family films in prefix = st1 /China', 'making family films in Chinais not easy', 'family films are about love']","It can be inferred that in the future,_.","TWENTY-FIVE years ago director Stephen Spielberg captured the hearts of Western audiences with his family classic.E.T.Now his Hong Kong director Stephen Chow is trying to do the same trick in China.
Chow's latest movie CJ7(<<>> ),in cinemas now,is a heart-warming story about a poor migrant worker  and his son.When a strange alien enters their lives,father and son learn a lesson about the value of family.Chow hopes his movie will help to make family films more popular in China.
Family films have been the main part of the Hollywood market for the last 40 years.They have given audiences movies like E.T., Indiana Jones and Jurassic Park.However, there are few of these movies in China, where expensive history films are more popular.
A family film is not simply a children's movie.It is a film that is not only suitable for children, but appeals to the whole family.
According to Raymound Zhou,a famous film critic,these films are rare in China because ""very few families go to the cinema together"".Because of this,there is little demand for movies that appeal to the whole family.
However, in the West,it is common for the family to sit down and watch a movie together.Tim Bridges, from London,says:""I love it at Christmas when I sit down and watch a movie with my family.""
All family films contain similar messages about being honest, remaining positive and learning there is more to life than money.According to the American movie reviewer,Dave Johnson, this is because ""When parents watch a movie,they want their children to be learning good values"".
Just like when the alien in Spielberg's E.T.phones home to make contact with his family, Chow will hope Chinese audiences are tuned in and ready to receive his family movie message.",high24187.txt
