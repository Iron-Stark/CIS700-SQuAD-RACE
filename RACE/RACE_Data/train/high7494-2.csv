Recently, the recruiting started.
The recruiting of Beijing Olympics Volunteer starts from Aug 28, 2006 to end of March 2008.
Stage 1: Beijing Volunteers
From August 28, 2006, the program opens to applicants in Beijing (and Beijing only).
Stage 2: China Volunteers
From Dec, 2006, people from outside Beijing can submit their application.
Stage 3: Overseas Volunteers
By March 2007, people from outside China (including in other countries) can apply for volunteering in Olympics 2008.
The Program
Travel, hotel are not provided. Only working meal is available for volunteers (makes sense, isn't it?)
If you have any questions, just call Olympics Volunteer hotline: +86-10-12308
According to news, 100k college students have applied for the position after three days of recruiting. 50,000 to 100,000 volunteers are needed for the game.
If you want to participate, just call the number and ask more questions about the program. However, my guess is, to be admitted to the program is not easy.",high7494.txt
