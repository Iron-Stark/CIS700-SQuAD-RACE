1,B,"['Americans are all workaholic.', ""Many Americans don't choose to take vacations."", 'Unemployment is going from bad to worse.', 'US economic situation becomes worse and worse.']",What's the main idea of the text?,"More than half of Americans do not take all their vacation days,even though they think they need one more holiday. And nearly a third of workers who take a break check their emails from the boss every other day and some even keep in touch hourly.
""We're workaholics ',""said Samuel Nahmias.""From a general perspective,this has a lot to do with the economic situation in the US. More and more people are unemployed.""
With jobless numbers reaching 9.6 percent,people who have jobs seem to be unwilling to take time off."" _ People are not going on vacation as much and those who are going on vacation are being more selective about where they are going.""Nahmias explained.
Unlike European countries where four or more weeks of holiday each year is normal,27 percent of people questioned in the poll said they had 6 to 10 days of annual leave and 20 percent had less than 3 days.With more people on unemployment lists in America,those still with jobs are facing more responsibility at work,which is reflected in their lack of time off.
The majority of workers who did not take time off mentioned too many responsibilities or stress at work,while some people said they simply did not have time to plan a holiday.""People are more conscious of what they are doing and when they are going on vacation because they don't want to look bad in this situation,""Nahmias explained.
Technology is also playing a part with smartphones enabling workers to keep in contact in ways that were not possible before.It has to do with technology and the level of concern about what is going on in the office.",high8910.txt
