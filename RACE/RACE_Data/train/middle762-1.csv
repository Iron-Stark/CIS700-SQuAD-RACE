1,C,"['always', 'often', 'sometimes', 'never']",Difficult people  _  realize they are difficult.,"They are out there. They may be your friends, your teachers or your parents. Anyone can be a difficult person to someone else.
It is important to see if you are with a difficult person. The first solution  to any problem is that you realize the problem. Most of the time, difficult people do not realize  they are difficult. They think what they do is just normal. But do you know how to cope with  difficult people?
The best way is not to care what they said.
If this does not help, think about the following:
*Difficult people are easy to be very angry, and you just happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.
*Difficult people do not even hear the words you say, but are only guessing the meaning of your words according to their own thought.
So when you really look at it deeply, it is not wise  to take things personally.",middle762.txt
