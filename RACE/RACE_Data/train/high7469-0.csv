0,D,"['they need more independence', ""mothers want daughters to be mama's girls again"", ""they think their mothers' clothes are no longer in fashion"", 'all of the above']",The girls would argue with their mothers because   _  .,"What happens to mother-daughter relationships when girls become teenagers. It seems that girls go from playing ""dress up"", to arguing with their mothers about how they should dress.
When a girl is 3-4 years old they love to ""dress up"" in their mothers' clothes, put on their mothers' makeup, cook, and do whatever else their mother does. This is the time when she can be classified as being a mama's girl.
How come girls change so much from childhood to the teenage years? Many parents seek the answer when their daughter becomes a teen. Often when a girl enters high school her behavior changes as well as her physical appearance.
When I was young I always liked playing ""dress up"". It made me feel older and more like my mother. Even when I entered middle school, I still depended a lot on my mother to choose and buy my clothes. Once I entered high school there was a big change. To me, my mother's clothes were no longer ""in fashion"", and neither was her opinion. I started becoming interested in boys and tried to improve the way I looked. It was not that I wanted to look cool, I just wanted to look my age.
This is the time that the mother-daughter relationship can take a turn. It's difficult for a mother to know that her daughter is no longer totally dependent on her.
When the daughter starts wearing revealing clothing, dating, and just wanting to be more independent, a mother starts to feel left out, or not needed. The number of arguments increases, and the number of times when the mother and daughter get along happily decreases.
When these things start to happen, it is a sign that the daughter wants her independence and the freedom to grow up.
When you notice how much your relationship had changed, try to believe positive things come out of the change. Put all the negatives aside and concentrate on what your mother is feeling instead of just on what you're feeling.
When it seems too hard to handle, take some quiet time and write out your feelings. Maybe at another time, you can share them with your mother and try to find a way to better your relationship as mother and daughter. If you don't feel comfortable sharing your feelings, at least write them down so you can get them out. It's better than keeping them bottled up inside.",high7469.txt
