What's New in Washington's Seaside City?
Advice to visit Seattle's Pike Place Market may border on cliche--but for a good reason.
""Whether you're visiting Washington's seaside city for vacation or just stopping by en route to and from the coming Sasquatch music festival, Pike Place is an easy catch-all destination for shopping, eating and just plain walking around,"" said Kirk Johnson, The New York Times's Seattle bureau chief for the past three years.
The Seattle Great Wheel is one of many stops to consider in Washington's seaside city.
""Almost any day of the week, especially on the weekend, it's a crazy fun scene of people shopping,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""There's also pretty good food."" He recommends wandering into whatever place--especially a hole in the wall--catches your eye.
There is one specific restaurant Mr. Johnson likes: the Pink Door, which has no signage and can be found only by its rosy entrance. ""It's creative, interesting Italian,"" he said. ""In the summer they get a lot of great fresh vegetables and probably have the best tomato bruschetta I've had.""
He also recommends the nearby Pioneer Square, the oldest neighborhood in Seattle. Its historic architecture has charm, and the area isn't bad for a lunch break, he said. The clear favorite here is Salumi--which, as the name suggests, is known for its cured meats. Mr. Johnson did warn, however, that it's necessary to plan for the fact that the restaurant has a long line as soon as it opens.
Pioneer Square is also a portal to Seattle's maritime world that remains alive and well. Ferry rides are a short walk away. Mr. Johnson said the ferry ride to Bainbridge Island provides ""a great view of the city,"" and it's not a long ride back to the mainland.
At some point, you may see sculptures emerging on the horizon--that would be the Olympic Sculpture Park, which is operated by the Seattle Art Museum, Mr. Johnson said, and that's worth a visit itself.
People who want to experience Seattle's nearby charms can easily do so with a bicycle, Mr. Johnson said, if they want to get away from depending on a car. He takes a ride to Chateau Ste. Michelle, a famous winery outside the city. Starting in June, he said, Chateau Ste. Michelle hosts a summer concert series on its lawn.",high11518.txt
