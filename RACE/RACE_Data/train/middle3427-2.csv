One morning while she was walking in the forest, she found two weak birds in the grass. She took them home and put them in a small cage. She looked after them with love and the birds both grew well. They thanked her with a wonderful song every morning.
But something happened one day. Helen left the door of the cage open. The larger bird flew from the cage. She thought that it would fly away, so she _ it. She was very excited to catch it. Suddenly she felt strange. She opened her hand and looked sadly at the dead bird. Her great love had killed the bird!
The other bird was moving back and forth   in the cage. Helen could feel the bird want to go out. It wanted to fly into the blue sky. At once, Helen took the bird out of the cage and let it fly away. The bird circled, twice, three times...
Helen enjoyed watching the bird flying and singing happily. Suddenly the bird flew closer and landed softly on her head. It sang the sweetest song that she had ever heard.
The easiest way to lose love is to hold too tight. The best way to keep love is to give it freedom.",middle3427.txt
