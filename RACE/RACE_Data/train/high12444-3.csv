3,A,"['how the agent tried to help the writer find a flat', ""why the writer was satisfied with the agent's service"", 'how difficult it was to find a new flat', 'you can depend on the estate agents for a nice flat']",The main idea of the passage is  _  .,"I moved to this area seven years ago. For years I have had noisy neighbours. Ever since I moved into this flat, I've had to put up with noise during the night. I decided I'd had enough and I've been looking for a new flat since the beginning of the year. I haven't found anything till now. Every week I go to the estate agent's office, but it's the same story. ""I might have something by the end of the week"" he says, or, ""Wait till next week. I think I might have a few flats by then."" I've seen a few flats during my search, but I don't like any of them. One flat I saw has been empty for two years. ""It's got a busy road on one side and a railway on the other!"" I said loudly, ""I want peace and quiet."" Last week I visited the agent again. ""I won't leave till you show me something,"" I said. ""I've got just the flat for you."" I went to see it and I was frightened. ""But it's next to a cemetery!"" I cried. ""But you won't have noisy neighbours,"" my agent said. ""It's exactly right for peace and quiet!""",high12444.txt
