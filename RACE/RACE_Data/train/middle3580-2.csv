2,B,"['change our lifestyle', 'appreciate ourselves', 'make more friliends', 'learn from others']",We are advised to,""" To seek  happiness is to look for it"" was once said by the famous French author Jules Renard. Look for it? Sure...but don't spend a lifetime trying, especially if it's well within your reach but you're just too blind to see it. Discover the three keys to happiness that you have already understood, but that you are just too afraid to find it.
1. Accepting Yourself
The idea of happiness is difficult to understand if you are not at peace with yourself. Learn to accept yourself as you are. Your next step will be to improve your attitude for tomorrow, for the next day, for the day after that, and so forth.
By beginning to accept reality, you will come to the final point of true happiness. Only when you are at peace with yourself, will you finally be able to admit  that you are, in fact, a happy person.
2. Forgiving Others
Forgiving others is a true show of humanity  which also allows us to feel more at ease. When you learn to forgive, you also learn to keep a firm hold on your life. To forgive is to open the doors of personal satisfaction. Yet you simply open your mind to answer, "" Do I really want to allow my anger to grow and eat me from inside out?""
3. Helping Your Neighbors
When a friend seems to be suffering from a state of depression  , it's quite easy to help him or her out of the trouble. The best attitude to have in this situation is to make him or her understand that he or she is not alone.
If you come to save a friend in need, you'll feel a lot more at peace with yourself. You will feel high--spirited by knowing that someone is looking at life on the brighter side thanks to your kind words.
