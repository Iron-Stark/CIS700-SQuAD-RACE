Jerry Douthett, 48, who woke up on a Saturday night in late July in his Rockford, Michigan home to find his Jack Russell Terrier, Kiko, had _ his right big toe.
""The dog always lies with me on the bed"", said Douthett. ""That night, I woke up and looked down at my foot, and it was wet. When I looked, it was blood and there was the dog looking at me with a blood moustache.""
Douthett's wife, Rosee, rushed him to a hospital where doctors found he was suffering from Type 2 diabetes. His toe was badly infected and surgeons amputated the remainder of the toe.
Douthett's wife, a registered nurse, had been urging him for weeks to have his infected toe examined by a doctor.
On the night Kiko ate his toe, Douthett said he had been out with his wife and drank about six or seven beers and a pair of giant margaritas--big enough to put goldfish in.
""I was self-medicating at this point,"" he said. ""The moral of the story is that the dog saved my life, because otherwise I would never have gone to see a doctor.""
The couple said they were amazed that Kiko appeared to know Douthett had an infection that needed treatment.
""He kind of chewed off the infected part and stopped at the good bone,"" said Rosee. ""We joked that we shouldn't have had to pay the co-pay because he did half the job by chewing off half of the toe.""",high12449.txt
