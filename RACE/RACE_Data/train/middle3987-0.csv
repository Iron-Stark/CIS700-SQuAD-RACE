0,D,"['People who are in different parts can understand each other easier.', 'People who are in different parts can understand each other harder.', 'It gets harder .', 'It gets easier.']","By reading the text, how do you feel about the communication of the world today?","Now people who are in different parts of the world communicate easier than before. But it is a little hard to understand each other well. Some of them may not understand others' words, so it's easy to make a few mistakes.
For example, an important question about eating out, is who pays for the meal. If a friend of yours suggests you have lunch with him, you might simply say something like this, ""I'm afraid it will have to be some place inexpensive, as I have very little money."" The other person might say, ""OK. I will meet you at McDonald's."" This means it is agreed that the two will go Dutch, that is, each person pays for himself. He might also say, ""Oh, no. I want to take you to lunch at Johnson's"", or "" I want you to try the steak  there. It is great."" This means that the person intends to pay the bill for both of you. If you feel friendly towards this person, there is no reason why you shouldn't accept this invitation. You might simply say, ""Thank you. That would be very nice.""
