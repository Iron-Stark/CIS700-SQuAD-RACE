0,B,"['Working as a waiter.', 'Becoming a film star.', 'Parking cars for film stars.', 'Owning a big company.']",Which of the following was Larry really interested in?,"As far back as he could remember,Larry had longed to go to Hollywood and become a film star. The young man's hopes for success were broken again and again, however. Hollywood just did not seem interesting. When he first came to California, Larry had decided never to give up and return home without success. Therefore, he kept on trying. Someday, he told himself, his big opportunity would come.
Larry found a job parking cars for one of Hollywood's big restaurants. His pay was basic, but since the guests were kind enough to give him more money, he managed to make a living. One day he recognized an important film director driving into the parking lot and getting out of his car. Larry had recently heard that the man was ready to make a new picture.
Larry got into the car and prepared to drive it on into the lot and park it. Then he stopped, jumped out, and ran over to the director. ""Excuse me, sir, but I think it is only fair to tell you that it is now or never if you want me in your next picture. A lot of big companies are after me.""
Instead of pushing away the boy,the director laughed,then wrote something on a card and handed it to the young man."" Come and see me tomorrow.""
Larry got a small part in the director's next film.",high15983.txt
