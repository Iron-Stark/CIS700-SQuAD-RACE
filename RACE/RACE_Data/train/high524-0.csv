For the new Japanese study,researchers decided to examine the question of whether green tea drinkers have a lower risk of frailty and disability as they grow older.
Tomata and his colleagues followed nearly 14,000 adults aged 65 or older for three years.
They found those who drank the most green tea were the least likely to develop ""functional disability"",or problems with daily activities or basic needs,such as dressing or bathing.
Specifically,almost 13 percent of adults who drank less than a cup of green tea per day became functionally disabled,compared with just over 7 percent of people who drank at least five cups fl day.
The study did not prove that green tea alone kept people active as they grew older.
Green-tea lovers generally had healthier diets,including more fish,vegetables and fruit,as well as more education.lower smoking rates,fewer heart attacks and strokes,and greater mental sharpness.
They also tended to be more socially active and have more friends and family to rely on.
Although it's not clear how green tea might offer a buffer against disability,Tomata's team did note that one recent study found green tea extracts seem to increase leg muscle strength in older women.
