""I want to invent things,"" Philo answered, ""and these are the drawings of one of my first inventions. I have an idea for a way of sending pictures through the air. Please, just let me tell you about it. _ "" In the school library Philo had read about a man who had worked on an idea for television, but had failed. Philo was sure that his own idea was better and that he could succeed.
