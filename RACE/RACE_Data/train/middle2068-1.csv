So if you ""play cat and mouse"" with someone, it means that you change between different kinds of behavior when dealing with another person. For example, a girl might offer something sweet to her little brother and then take it away when he reaches for it.
Americans might say that something is ""the cat's miaow"" or ""the cat's pajamas "" to describe something that is the best or finest. ""A copycat"" is someone who acts just like someone else or copies another person's work. ""A fat cat"" is a person with a lot of money.
If you tell about something that is supposed to be a secret, we say you ""let the cat out of the bag"". If you are not able to speak or answer a question, someone might ask you if ""the cat has got your tongue ""
