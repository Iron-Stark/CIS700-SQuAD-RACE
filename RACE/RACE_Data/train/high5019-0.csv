0,A,"[""there was a Mother's Day"", ""there was a Children's Day"", 'people liked their fathers a lot', 'fathers were more important']",Father's Day was started just because  _  .,"Father's Day has a very short history. It was started because there was a Mother's Day. And just because some Americans thought that if we had a Mother's Day, we should also have a Father's Day. Father's Day has become important in North America. And shopkeepers found it was a good way to get people to buy presents for their fathers, presents from their shops.
By the way, very few countries have a Father's Day, though some have Children's Day, or a special day for boys and another for girls. More and more countries are having Mother's Day, so maybe Father's Day will also become popular before too long. Now, what do people in North America do on Father's Day? The newspapers, radios, and TV tell children what they should do-buy a Father's Day present for your father. They even tell a wife to buy a Father's Day present-not for her father but for her husband, even if he is not yet a father. And they tell grandchildren to buy a Father's Day present for their grandfathers.
The important thing to remember about Father's Day is that American children can show their love to their fathers in a more open way.",high5019.txt
