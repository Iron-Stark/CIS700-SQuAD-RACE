We all have weaknesses and strengths-no matter who we are. Sometimes the weaknesses seem to outweigh the strengths and sometimes it's the other way around. Some people get sick easily.

I attended a school prize-giving ceremony not so long ago and the guest speaker was Andrew Becroft, who had a severe stutter as a child. Instead of allowing this to limit him, he chose to work hard to overcome it. He is now the Principal Youth Court Judge for New Zealand. Not only did he become successful, but he did so in a profession where he had to speak in front of others regularly where his weakness is front and center for all to see. If he hadn't worked on his speaking ability, it would have been very limiting to his life and career prospects.
You can find similar people on New Zealand News channels, and I suspect the same in other countries. There are a number of presenters and reporters who have a noticeably unusual manner of speaking. Perhaps they have a peculiar accent or pitch of voice. These people have succeeded in spite of what would appear to be a weakness in their profession.
