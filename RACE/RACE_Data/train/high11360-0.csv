0,A,"['offers students the chances to have a natural living at college', 'was firstly built by two college students', 'was designed for saving building materials', 'is only applicable in few schools']",We can learn from the text that the EcoDorm in the US  _  .,"Across the United States, universities and colleges have been looking to become more sustainable   and more than 600 schools have already planned to become eco-friendly. The EcoDorm, home to 36 students at Warren Wilson College in Swannanoa, was designed to be sustainable from top to bottom, or in this case, from its rainwater-collection system to its garden. The dormitory is bringing new meaning to the concept of living ""green"" at college.
At Warren Wilson College, a biological science school with fewer than 1,000 students, the sustainability drive came from the student body. The EcoDorm concept was presented ten years ago by two students; a planning committee firstly suggested using building materials like corncob. Although the architects disagreed with the idea, they came up with other creative solutions: Wood siding was taken from the trees grown in the school yard that were suffering from a disease, and rainwater was collected in an old railway car and pumped back into the house to clean the toilets.
All in all, the dorm uses nearly two-thirds less electricity than a similar-sized traditional building world. But even the most sustainable homes need continued efforts from its livers. And in the case of EcoDorm, students live by their words. Most also take advantage of the dorm's bio-garden, planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables. ""I didn't have to worry about paper towels being wasted or feel bad about drying my clothes outside,"" Jeremy Lekich, the dorm's gardener, said. ""Basically, it has made my life easier.""",high11360.txt
