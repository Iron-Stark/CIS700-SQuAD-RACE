A good memory is a great help in learning language . Everybody learns his own language by remembering what he learns when he is a little child. And some children , who live abroad with their parents ,seem to learn two languages more easily . In native school it is not easy to learn a second language because the pupils have so little time for it . and they are busy with other subjects . A man's mind is like a camera, but it takes photos not only of what we see but of what we feel ,hear, smell and taste . When we take a real photo with a camera ,there is much to do before the photo is finished and ready to show to our friends . In the same way there is much work to do be done before we can keep a picture forever in our mind . Memory is the diary that we all carry about with us .
