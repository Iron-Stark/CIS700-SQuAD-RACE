This saying may have been on the minds of bosses at China's main online video providers, Youku.com Inc and Tudou Holdings Ltd, when the one-time rivals agreed to merge   on March 12. The deal will create the country's largest company in the online video industry, Youku Tudou Inc.
Three months ago, the two companies were involved in a copyright dispute. On December 12, Tudou charged Youku.com with illegally airing the entertainment series,Kangxi is coming. Tudou was the only company which had rights to the series. In response, Youku filed a lawsuit  against Tudou, claiming the company was broadcasting more than 50 Youku-owned TV series.
