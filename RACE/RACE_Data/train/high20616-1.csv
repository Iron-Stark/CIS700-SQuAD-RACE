1,C,"[""they couldn't pay for parking by check"", 'neither of them had money with them', 'they had no five-dollar bill', 'there was no parking lot near the conference']",The problem the author had in parking their car was that   _  .,"She handed me a five dollar bill through the car window, then turned and walked away. I don't know her name, nor where she was going ,but I know I will never forget that stranger who generously saved me from a lot of frustration  and prevented me from walking a mile or more to my destination. 
That day My husband, Leo, and I were already a half hour late for an important conference . We had taken the wrong fork in the expressway, and found ourselves stuck in traffic that was blocked for four miles due to a serious accident. 
When we finally were able to exit, we tried to find parking lots near the hosting hotel. But they were all full. Not expecting this, neither of us had brought change; all we had was a twenty dollar bill. When we did find some space in a lot two blocks away from the conference, we were unable to pay the automatic box for parking. So we needed five dollars.
  We asked several people approaching the pay box if they could change a twenty. ""No"", ""No"", ""No"" were their answers. So,  _ , we walked back to our car, got inside, and started to back out. We were going to look for other parking spot on the street that would surely have taken us a longer distance away.
Just then, one tapped on the window on the passenger side. It was a short, medium-built woman, who was all bundled up in jacket and scarf, wearing jeans and boots. Surprised, I was reluctant, at first, to roll the window down. What could she possibly want? I lowered the window just enough to hear what the woman had to say. Through the window, she shoved a five dollar bill. ""I don't have change,"" she said, ""but here is an extra five dollar bill. Use it to pay for your parking spot."" I was floored! Was this woman, whom I'd never seen before, actually giving me this much money? Yes, that was exactly what she was doing! She wouldn't take the check I offered her for the cash. She just walked away.",high20616.txt
