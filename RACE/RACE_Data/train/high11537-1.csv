What follows is a list of some of these untruths and some tips to help you do your best at your next interview.
Myth 1: The aim of interviewing is to obtain (means ""get"") a job offer.
Only half true. The real aim of an interview is to obtain the job you want. That often means rejecting job offers you don't want! So before you please an employer, be sure you want the job.
Myth 2: Always please the interviewer
Not true. Try to please yourself. Of course, don't be hostile--nobody wants to hire someone disagreeable. But there is plainly a muddle ground between being too ingratiating and being hostile.
Myth 3: Try to control the interview
Nobody ""controls"" an interview. When someone tries to control us, we resent it. When we try to control others, they resent us. Remember you can't control what an employer thinks of you, just as he can't control what you think of him. So he is ready to give and take when being interviewed; never control the interview.

Just _ Try being yourself for a change. Employers will either like or dislike you, but at least you'll have made an impression. Leaving an employer indifferent is the worst impression you can make.",high11537.txt
