2,D,"['he was too old to learn drawing', 'he suffered an accident.', 'he was not used to holding a pen or brush', 'his hands were out of shape as a result of hard work']",Albert refused his brother's offer because.,"Born into a poor family,two of the Durers' children still had a dream for art,but they knew their father could not afford to send either of them to the academy .
After discussions,the two boys finally agreed to toss a coin.The loser would go to the nearby mines and support his brother while he attended the academy.Then,when the winner completed his studies,he would support the other brother,either with sales of his art work or,if necessary,by working in the mines.So they tossed a coin.Albrecht Durer won the toss and went to Nuremberg.Albert went to the dangerous mines and financed his brother,whose work at the academy was almost an immediate success,and by graduation,he was beginning to earn considerable fees for his works.
When the Durer family held a dinner to celebrate Albrecht's homecoming, Albrecht drank a toast to his brother,""Now,Albert,it is your turn to go to Nuremberg and follow your dream,and I will take care of you.""
Albert wiped the tears from his cheeks,glanced at the faces he loved,and said softly,""No,brother.It is too late for me.Look....look what four years in the mines have done to my hands! The bones in every finger have been broken at least once,and lately I have been suffering from arthritis so badly in my right hand that I cannot even hold a glass to return your toast,much 1ess make lines on canvas with a pen or a brush.No,brother ...for me it is too 1ate.""
Therefore,Albrecht took pains to draw his brother's injured hands with palms together and thin fingers stretched skyward.The entire world almost immediately opened their hearts to his great masterpiece and named it ""The Praying Hands"".",high15523.txt
