1,C,"['Micheal was kicked three times.', 'Micheal kicked the boss.', 'The boss was kicked twice', 'The boss kicked the author.']",What can be inferred from the text?,"My husband, Micheal, and I were at a restaurant with his boss, a rather stern  elderly man. When Micheal began a story I was sure he had told before, I gave him a kick under the table. There was no response, so I gave him another kick. Still the story went on. Suddenly he stopped and said with a smile, ""Oh, but I've told you this one before, haven't I ?"" We all chuckled and changed the subject.
Later, on the dance floor, I asked my husband why it had taken him so long to get my message. ""What do you mean?"" he replied. ""I cut off the story as soon as you kicked me.""
""But I kicked you twice, and it still took you a while to stop!""
Suddenly we realized what had happened and returned to our table. The boss smiled and said, ""Don't worry. After the second one I thought it wasn't for me, so I passed it along!""",high1018.txt
