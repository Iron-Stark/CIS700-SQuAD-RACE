1,C,"['Having an equal chance for the young in China.', 'Having the best education for her children.', 'Managing a bookstore or a flower shop in her middle ages.', ""Taking a four weeks' vacation every year.""]",Which one is Yiqiong Zhang's dream?,"Recently, China Dream has been the subject of a public topic. Although it is quite common for Chinese people to dream of a developed China, most people also have their own dreams. I interviewed several young Chinese students with higher US educational backgrounds. They all had their own dreams for their native country.
Fred Wang, an MBA student in the US, said, ""I dream of equal chance for the young in China. Equality means all young people can compete fairly, based on the rule-of-law no matter whether they are rich or poor.""
Yujie Zhao, another MBA student in California, said, ""I dream of having the best education for my children so they will not lose at the starting line, and I dream of being able to take good care of my parents after they return home from work.""
Yiqiong Zhang, an MBA graduate from the US, shared her dreams. ""I have a dream which I have been holding for many years, that is after working hard for about 20 to 25 years, I can have enough money to build and manage a bookstore or a flower shop. Besides working hard, I am able to enjoy life, to play the piano, to hike and to enjoy a two-month-long vacation every year. This may be a common dream among young Chinese students.""
There is no doubt that all of these young students have their own China Dream. They all love chasing their dreams. The beautiful China Dream requires everyone's hard work. Everyone should work hard to make their dreams come true.",middle3264.txt
