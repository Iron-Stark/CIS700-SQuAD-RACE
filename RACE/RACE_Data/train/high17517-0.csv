0,A,"['He is very fond of traveling.', ""He doesn't drink wine now."", 'He cannot speak a foreign language.', 'He used to be a housekeeping manager.']",What do we know about Estrella?,"Juanito Estrella has been a housekeeping manager on the US-based large passenger ship Carnival Spirit for 18 months and feels he  has found the suitable position in his career .He has always wanted to travel. ""I guess I am a really restless spirit. I like traveling, so when the chance came, I jumped at it,"" he says.
    The chance came in the form of a newspaper advertisement for work on cruise ships .At the time Estrella was the housekeeping manager at a Melbourne hotel. He applied and, after two interviews, a medical check and police clearance, the job was his.
    Estrella is responsible for the cleanliness of the ship, making sure that 160 crew work properly. ""I enjoy it because there is no other work-you wake up each day in a different place and a different culture. It's exciting when you go to the next country and you don't understand the language,"" he says.
    Estrella likes being busy and getting to know people from all over the world. The 1,000 crew come from 94 countries, and Estrella has learnt Spanish and a little Croatian.
    But there is a downside .""You cannot get really drunk...because you have safety responsibilities to yourself and others,"" he says. ""You don't really think about home. You start to think about home only when you get closer to your vacation and wonder what you'll be doing.""
    Life on the ship is anything but cruising. Estrella and his fellows work at least 10 hours a day, seven days a week. He warns the job is not for everybody. ""You have to love being busy and be prepared to work every day-and to give up drinking too much alcohol."" In his spare time, if the ship sails into a port, Estrella explores it, otherwise he works out in the crew's gym, goes on the internet or calls home.",high17517.txt
