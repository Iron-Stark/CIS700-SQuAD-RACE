3,C,"['A Smart Student---- Evalthus', 'A Great Teacher---Protagoras', 'Come Here One Hundred Years Later', 'A Fight Between Teacher and Student']",What is probably the best title for the text?,"Protagoras was among the great teachers of ancient Athens. He taught many subjects, including the laws of argument  and the right use of language. It is said that he was the  first teacher to accept money for his services.
A student, Evalthus, heard of this famous teacher and asked him to give him lessons. However, Evalthus didn't want to pay for his lessons at once, and after some discussion it was finally agreed between them that Evalthus should pay only if he won his first case in the court. For if he won, it would prove that he had been taught well.
The lessons began and Evalthus proved himself to be a good student. But he refused to pay Protagoras anything at the end of his studies.
Protagoras therefore took Evalthus to the court and told the judges that he wanted his money. He explained that he must be paid whether he won or lost the case. ""Whatever you decide,"" he declared to the judges, "" I must be paid. For if you decide in my fovor , then I win the case, and so I must be paid . But If you decide against me, then Evalthus has won his first case in the court; according to our agreement, he must pay his lessons. Therefore I shall get my money whatever happens.""
The Athenian judges found no fault in it, so they asked Evalthus to reply.
""No, it's quite clear,"" said Evalthus, "" that I need not pay. If the judged decide in my favor, then I have won the case, and I need not to pay. But if Protagoras wins, then I have lost my first case. Therefore, according to our agreement, I do not have to pay. So I need not pay in any event.""
As both arguments appeared to be faultless, the judges were unable to come to a decision. They therefore ordered the two men to appear before them again one hundred years later.",high9038.txt
