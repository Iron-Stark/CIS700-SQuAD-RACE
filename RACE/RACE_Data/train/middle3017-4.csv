4,C,"[""If we have only a little, we shouldn't help others"", 'When we have problems, we must ask others for help', 'We should learn to be thankful and share what we have with others', 'When we meet with difficulties, we should complain about them.']",What can we learn from the passage ?,"Today, I felt terrible. My head was full of problems and confusion . I decided to take a walk even though I didn't know where to go. The most special thing happened when I was out for this walk.
I saw an old man sitting on a chair. He was a seller of second-hand shoes. I thought he looked at least 70 years old. He seemed so tired and nobody was buying his shoes. I wanted to give him something but I had not brought anything with me.
Then, a little girl came toward him. I heard the child say, ""Grandfather, may I polish   your shoes?"" That old man took pity on her, smiled and gave her a shoe to polish.
The girl told him she needed money to buy her brother a new school uniform.
""Oh, little girl. Just stop doing this. Come with me and I will buy you a uniform."" Then they walked to a market , and he bought her brother a uniform.
The girl said ""thanks"" to him and left, leaving the old man smiling.
He walked away from the market, but I stopped him. I whispered in his ear, ""You are a hero! Thank you for your kindness!""  As I walked away, I looked back and I could see him still smiling.
I was blown away by the kindness I had just seen.  Someone who had so little was so generous! Amazing! My own sadness had completely disappeared, chased way by the light of this kind act.
I began realizing that I have a lot to be thankful for. I hope, some day, I can show my appreciation   of what I have by following the example of the old man. He only had a little, but shared it so beautifully with someone who had nothing.",middle3017.txt
