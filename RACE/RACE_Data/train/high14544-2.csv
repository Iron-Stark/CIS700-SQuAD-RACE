2,D,"['Functions of the road in the future.', 'Development of solar energy.', 'Free energy on the road.', 'Solar road of the future.']",What is the text mainly about?,"Free energy is everywhere around us. There are many ways to make and collect energy from various sources like sun, wind and water. People also realize that everyday stuff can be a source of energy too. For example, riding a bike, running or just walking, etc. We simply have to change our way of thinking if we want to change the world.
So comes the idea of solar roadways. Are they the road of future? Why use roads just for driving and collecting tolls  ? Why don't we use them for collecting energy?
The US Department of Transportation recently awarded $100,000 to Solar Roadways to build the first ever Solar Road Panel. So how do these future roads work?
The Solar Road Panels will contain embedded   LEDs which ""paint"" the road lines from beneath to provide safer nighttime driving as well as to give drivers instant instructions such as detour   ahead. The road will be able to sense wildlife on the road and can warn drivers to ""slow down"". There will also be embedded heating elements in the surface to prevent snow and ice buildup, providing safer winter driving.
Replacing asphalt   roads and parking lots with Solar Roadway Panels will be a major step toward stopping climate change. Fully electric vehicles will be able to recharge along the roadway and in parking lots, finally making electric cars practical for long trips.
We just can't wait to see more of these roads all over the world in the near future.",high14544.txt
