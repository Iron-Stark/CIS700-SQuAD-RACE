0,D,"['Earthquake.', 'Flooding.', 'Traffic Accident.', 'Heavy snowstorms.']",What took place in Long Chuan's hometown last winter?,"Many children love to play with snow in winter. But Long Chuan has come to hate it.
This year his hometown suffered from snowstorms   for nearly a month. The heavy snow stopped cars and trains, broke the electricity   tower and turned tap water to ice.
Every day Long Chuan had to walk several kilometers to carry drinking water. ""I couldn't ride a bike and it took me 3 hours to walk to school. I can't remember how many times I slipped   on the hard ice, "" said Long Chuan.
Long is not alone. This year millions of people in central and southern China had a freezing winter without enough water and electricity. The biggest snowstorms in 50 years killed more than 100 people. They also cost the country 111.1 billion yuan.
Experts   say a special type of climate condition  , La Nina, caused the storms. During a La Nina, the water in the Pacific Ocean   near the equator   becomes colder than usual. It changes the weather around the world.
Besides China, Canada, the US and Middle Eastern countries also met with heavy snowstorms this winter. The special climate caused the recent flooding   in Australia, too.
