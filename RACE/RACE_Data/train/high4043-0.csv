0,D,"['is the present Cambodian Prime Minister', 'went for an interview with CCTV the other day', 'made the right choice to encourage investment in China', 'had great influence on Sino-Cambodian relations']",We can learn from the passage that Sihanouk   _  .,"Cambodians are continuing to mourn the death of King-Father Norodom Sihanouk, who died in Beijing this week. In an exclusive interview with CCTV, China's ambassador to Cambodia, Pan Guangxue, says Sihanouk made indelible  contributions to Sino-Cambodian relations and his death will not affect the friendship between the two countries.
Since its founding, the People's Republic of China has maintained close contact with Cambodia. Bilateral  trade volume has increased rapidly in recent years, from 200 million US dollars in 2002 to nearly 2.5 billion US dollars in 2011.
China is now not only Cambodia's third largest trading partner, but for many years has been Cambodia's number one investor. Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's ""King-Father"" pioneered the relationship.
Pan Guangxue said, ""If we look back at previous decades, I think Sihanouk made the right choice, a choice good to Cambodian national development. It was because of his commitment to the development of Sino-Cambodia friendship that we've achieved what we have today.""
In 2010, the two countries established a comprehensive strategic partnership, during its Prime Minister Hun Sen's visit to China.
And 2013 is set to be China-Cambodia Friendship Year.
Pan Guangxue said, ""Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said on many occasions that China does not tell Cambodia what to do or what not to do. China does not point fingers at Cambodia. I think this is a true evaluation of Sino-Cambodian relations. China pursues an independent peaceful foreign policy of non-alignment  and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.""
The ambassador says Sihanouk's death is a huge loss to both China and Cambodia, but that bilateral relations will not be affected.
Pan Guangxue said, ""I believe the bilateral relationship will be sustained and grow even stronger.""
With both countries enjoying the benefits of the fruitful relationship, the governments of China and Cambodia have promised that Sihanouk's legacy  will continue to be the foundation of even stronger ties.",high4043.txt
