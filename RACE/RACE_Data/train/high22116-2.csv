2,C,"['Easterners believe using the eyes to express feelings is the best way', ""it's polite to focus on other people's eyes in some Asian countries"", 'Easterners tend to use the eyes to express their emotions', ""it's easier for Easterners to communicate using the eyes""]",The Asian volunteers may have focused on the eyes because  _  .,"Several decades ago, US sociologists developed a series of universal facial images supposed to represent the seven basic human emotions: happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, disgust, anger and neutrality  . But now, a new study by researchers at the University of Glasgow indicates that these standardized facial images aren't so universal at all.
For the study, the Scottish researchers found 13 Western Caucasians (mainly Europeans) and 13 East Asians (mostly Chinese students). The volunteers were shown the standardized facial images and asked to identify the emotions being expressed. At the same time, the researchers electrically monitored the eye movements of the volunteers.
According to the results, published in the journal Current Biology, the Asian participants had a harder time than the Caucasians telling the difference between a face meant to look fearful compared with one showing surprise, and a face supposedly expressing disgusting compared with one displaying anger. ""This strongly suggests that the meanings of facial expressions are different across cultures,"" says Rachael Jack, who led the study.
The study also showed that the volunteers focused on different parts of the face in their efforts to understand the underlying  emotions. ""Westerners look at both the eyes and the mouth to the same degree, yet Easterners favor the eyes and overlook the mouth. This means that Easterners has difficulty distinguishing facial expressions that are similar around the eyes,"" Ms Jack says. The faces representing fear and surprise"" both have big, wide open eyes, while the mouths are very different,"" she notes. ""It would be difficult to distinguish between the two if you didn't look at the mouth.""
So why would different cultures express emotions in different ways? Ms Jack thinks it may be considered impolite in some Asian cultures to display certain emotions in an obvious manners, and that they use more subtle ways to express them. In particular, muscle movements around their eyes could be more important for expressing feelings than over-expressive mouth movement, explaining why the Asian participants focused on the eyes.",high22116.txt
