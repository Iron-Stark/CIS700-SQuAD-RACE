Eddie Morra, the main character in the movieLimitlesscan do all these things. But he isn't Superman or Harry Potter. Eddie has taken pills called NZT.
ThrillerLimitless came out in China on October 13. In the movie, Eddie is faced with ""writer's block"". He hasn't written a single word of a novel, and his deadline has passed. And there's more bad news: his girlfriend breaks up with him. By chance, Eddie runs into a relative who is a drug dealer. He gives Eddie some pills called NZT that allow people to make use of 100 percent of their brains. With the magic pills, Eddie's life changes completely. He can recall everything he has ever read, seen or heard. He gains a sixth sense that allows him to predict future events. He even becomes a kungfu master by simply memorizing actions in Bruce Lee's movie.
Before long he has finished his novel, won back his girlfriend and stepped into the financial world. He becomes rich incredibly quickly and is soon employed by a powerful Wall Street company. However, bad side effects are just around the corner. The effects of the pill last for only one or two days, and Eddie has to find more supplies of the pills. Meanwhile, the pills start to have other effects on him. Eddies' mind loses the ability to control the actions of his body. What does destiny hold for him? Will he be able to go back to his normal life?
""Eddie's fate turns out to be a barbed   joke... a sharp-eyed comic fable for an age of greed  and speed."" writes A. O. Scott, a movie critic with the New York Times.
