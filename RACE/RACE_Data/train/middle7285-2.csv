2,B,"['Listening to music.', 'Joining an English club.', 'Translating texts, dialogues and songs.', 'Reading a lot.']",Which way of learning English is NOT mentioned in the passage?,"I started to study English when I was a child because of Michael Jackson. He has been my idol   since 1991. I really wanted to understand him and his music. I used to use a dictionary to learn the meanings of words of songs written by him.
There was a lot of work to do to learn English, but I never felt tired. At first I learned about pronunciation, which was the hardest part for me. Because music was my
only source   of spoken English, sometimes I had to use a pronunciation dictionary. Then I made lists of words in order to remember them and their meanings. I would spend hours learning English grammar. What's more, I read a lot. I also tried to translate texts, dialogues and songs.
Because of my hard work, my English improved a lot. In the end, I entered a college and had a great chance to further improve my English. Now I am an English teacher. And I am still making progress in English.",middle7285.txt
