0,A,"['Different attitudes British men have towards crying.', ""British men's dream of the World Cup."", 'Advice on how to control emotions.', 'Impression of British men.']",What does the passage mainly deal with?,"British men are encouraged to cry.
There are certain things British men like to believe about themselves. The first is that one day they will again win the World Cup. They also believe they do not cry. Over the centuries, Britons are believed to have a ""stiff upper lip"". But is this true?
Yes, it is. A recent study arranged by Kleenex on how the British express their emotions reveals that 95 percent of them still _ their emotions.
Moreover, while 72 percent think this is unhealthy, 19 percent can't remember the last time they ""let it out"". As a result, Kleenex is launching the ""Let It Out"" campaign that encourages Britons to grab a tissue and have a good cry.
These days, however, the male Briton's attitude toward crying is changing. Though the majority still struggles to open up emotionally, a 2004 study by Oxford's Social Issues Research Center found that 77 percent of British men considered crying in public increasingly acceptable. Half of London males admitted crying in front of their mothers. Scotsmen are the least emotional, although they are the most likely to cry at weddings.
Peter Marsh, director of the center, said, ""Crying can now indicate sensitivity rather than weakness. Like with David Beckham, crying because you're dropping off your boy at nursery isn't seen as weak.""
Winston Churchill was said to be a frequent crier, shedding tears at seeing a survivor in an air raid shelter , and when he saw his wife after a long absence.
Psychologists say that while society has accepted that men can cry, there are limits. Ronald Bracey, a consulting psychologist, said, ""If a man began to cry when he was having stitches in hospital, he would be considered as a wimp . Men still need to be seen as strong when it comes to physical pain. """,high8806.txt
