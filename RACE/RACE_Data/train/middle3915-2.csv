All examinations they want to pass require them to first pass English. English has become the most popular course in tutorial classes and even in the self-study classroom.
When nearly all students' attention is focused on English, looking at the situation of our mother language, even Chinese _ get confused about its use. Not only have many new words and phrases which are very popular on the Internet started to fill in every corner of the society, common use of Chinese is full of mistakes and misunderstandings are all around.
Chinese has the most speakers of any world language and also one of the oldest in history. Around the world, many countries have started enthusiastically learning Chinese and Chinese has become one of the most important foreign languages in some foreign countries.
