0,A,"['Cheap and good.', 'Cheap but bad.', 'Expensive and bad.', 'Expensive but good.']",How was the food in White Rose Restaurant?,"The food in White Rose Restaurant was cheap and good, but nobody seemed to want to eat there. There were very few people going to eat there. The owner was very worried about it.
Then he thought of a good idea. A few weeks later, his restaurant was always full of men and their girlfriends.  Whenever a gentleman came with a lady, a kind waiter would give each of them a beautiful menu. The menus looked exactly the same on the outside, but there was an important difference inside. The menu that the waiter handed to the man gave the correct price for each dish and each bottle of wine, while the menu that he handed to the lady gave a much higher price! So when the man calmly ordered dish after dish and wine after wine, the lady thought he was much more generous than he really was! The man could make a good impression on the lady.",middle7943.txt
