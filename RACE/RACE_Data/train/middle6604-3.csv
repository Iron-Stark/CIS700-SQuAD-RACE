3,D,"['on weekdays', 'on Saturdays', 'at weekends', 'A and C']",The students can borrow the library books   _  .,"Our school is No 1 Middle School. It is not big, and it has a short history, but I'm lucky that I am a student of this school.
Ten years ago, there were not any teaching buildings and not a library in our school. The playground was so small that we could only play basketball there.
Now great changes have taken place in our school in the past ten years. There are three modern teaching buildings and there four modern computer classrooms. We have computer studies every week. On the left side of the school stands a modern lab building. On the right side of the school there is also a modern building--the library. In the library there are 20 thousand books and magazines. We can go to the library to borrow books and magazines at any time. We have built a new playground. It is much bigger than before. We can play not only basketball but also football and many other sports there. There are a lot of flowers, grasses and trees in and around our school. We usually take a walk or chat with our classmates after lunch and supper between the flowers and trees. We always feel very happy.
In a word, our school is more and more beautiful and modern. We love our school.",middle6604.txt
