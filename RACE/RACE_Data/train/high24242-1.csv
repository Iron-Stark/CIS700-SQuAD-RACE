1,B,"['in a long street', 'far from the city', 'near where I live', 'with me']",My parents live   _  .,"I lived in a big city. It's noisy and dirty and I got very tried. At the weekends I like to leave the city and get some fresh air and a good rest. A few weekends ago I decided to see my parents. I was really looking forward to it.
My parents live a long way away. I went to see them with James, a friend, and we drove down on Friday night. In the middle of the trip it began to rain. The roads became very wet and it was difficult to drive. We arrived home just after midnight, feeling tired. The next morning it was still raining. James took his car to the local garage which was very good.
In the afternoon the weather became better. We wanted to go for a drive. My parents lent us their car. That was no good. Their car didn't work! We rang the garage. ""Oh, no."" they said, ""your car won't be ready until tomorrow."" So it wasn't possible to go for a drive. We decided to play a word game. When we didn't agree about a word we looked for a dictionary. It wasn't there. Suddenly my mother remembered. ""I lent it to your sister. She took it with her when she left."" The word game wasn't any good without a dictionary.
On Sunday my mother dropped a suitcase on her foot and we had to hire a taxi to take her to hospital. When James and I drove back we got stuck in a traffic jam. Next time I want to have a rest. I'll stay in the city!",high24242.txt
