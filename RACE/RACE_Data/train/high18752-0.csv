0,C,"['They are against it since the unemployed are poor.', 'They are for it since the unemployed should keep fit.', ""They are for it since it's unfair for the employed and unemployed."", ""They don't care as there're a few unemployed people having welfare benefit.""]",What will most British people think of the new reform according to William Hague?,"Britain's longterm unemployed could be forced to carry out manual work or risk losing their welfare benefits under plans being put forward by the government. 
The U.S.style scheme would see the longterm jobless ordered to take up fourweek placements in order to get them used to having a fulltime job.
The idea is part of major reforms, due to be unveiled this week, to make cuts to Britain's huge welfare bill, reduce dependency on benefits and weed out those earning money but not declaring it, papers said.
""What we are talking about here is people who have not been used to working having both the opportunity and perhaps a bit more of a push as well, to experience the workplace from time to time. The vast majority of people in Britain will think that is the right thing to do."" Foreign Secretary William Hague told BBC TV.
Shortly after the ConservativeLiberal Democrat Union took power in May, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith unveiled plans to simplify the complex web of benefits available to reduce errors and inefficiencies.    
Duncan Smith said the system had become regressive and was not giving people the right encouragement to work as many were financially better off unemployed.  
Under his plans separate benefits for items such as housing, income support or disability will be replaced by a ""universal credit"" system whereby   individual households would get a single welfare payment to ensure those in work would be better off.
The Observer newspaper said that in return, longterm unemployed would be told to take up work placements of at least 30 hours a week for a fourweek period.
If they refuse or fail to complete the programme, their jobseekers' allowance, worth 64.30 pounds a week for those over 25, could be stopped for at least three months.",high18752.txt
