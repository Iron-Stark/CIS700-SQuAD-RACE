Malia and Sasha have to play two sports: one they choose and one selected by their mother.

The girls have to eat their vegetables, and if they say they are not hungry, they cannot ask for cookies or chips later.
While these might be shocking to some, Michelle said, ""They're not little princess. It's just basic rules, boundaries, and expectations that we would have normally.""
Michelle also mentions another set of rules:

They must play a team sport, because it's about learning how to play on a team, how to lose and how to win gracefully.
