0,C,"['Education', 'A Mastery of English', 'A Good Education', 'Something About Study']",The best title for this passage might be   _  .,"What is a good education? The question is far from being answered. Once more, colleges and universities are changing their programs: they _ ""fun courses"" and restart some of the traditional subjects neglected   since the 1960s. Many great schools are again requiring the students to take a number of classes in English, history, literature, the social sciences, philosophy, the natural sciences, and art if they want to get a degree. Meanwhile, the experts are trying to describe the good education of our time. Obviously the purely vocational training once favored is not enough. But neither is the gentleman's education of the nineteenth century. Educational programs must meet the demands of a modern world where men and women have to work and to deal with big problems.
What, then, is a good education of this century? Some educators suggest that it should include foreign languages and the study of foreign cultures; a mastery of English, including the ability to write and speak well, because communications have become all-important in the modern world, and also because ""a person who doesn't speak and write clearly doesn't reason clearly either""; some knowledge of the social sciences (sociology, psychology) that deal with human relations and human problems; some basic knowledge of modern science, which would enable future voters to be better informed about current problems like nuclear. Finally, many educators insist that all college graduates should be familiar with computers and modern information system since the educated professionals of tomorrow will have to understand their machines. Is that all? ""No, of course not."" answer the educators. ""We have not mentioned the two great building blocks of education: history and literature!""",high3652.txt
