So far,scientists have named about 1.8 million living species ,and that's just a small number of what probably exists on Earth.With so many plants,animals,and other living things covering the planet,it can be tough to figure out what type of grass is growing by the roadside or what kind of bird just flew by.
A soon-to-be-started Web site might help.An international team of researchers has announced the creation of Web-based Encyclopedia  of Life(EoL).The project aims to list every species on Earth in a single,easy-to-use reference guide.
To get the encyclopedia started,the creators will use information from scientific databases  that already exist.And eventually,in special sections of the site,non-scientists with specialized knowledge will come to help.Bird-watchers,for example,will be able to input what birds they've seen and where.To make sure the encyclopedia is accurate,scientists will review much of the information added to it.
As the EoL develops,you might find it useful for school projects.The site will feature(......) _ special pages for kids who are studying ecosystems in their neighborhoods.Another convenient feature of the EoL is that you'll be able to pick the level of detail you want to see to match your interests,age,and knowledge.
It now takes years for scientists to collect all the data they need to describe and analyze species.The creators of the Encyclopedia of Life hope that their new fool will speed up that process.",high8264.txt
