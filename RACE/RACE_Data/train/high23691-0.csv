Many of us use a lift several times a day without thinking about it. But Lee Gray, PhD of America, has made it his business to examine this overlooked form of public transport. ""The lift becomes this interesting social space where manners are sort of strange, ""Gray told the BBC, ""They are socially very interesting but often very awkward places.""
We walk in and usually turn around to face the door. If someone else comes in, we may have to move. And here, according to Gray, lift users unthinkingly go through a set pattern of movements. He explained that when you are the only one inside a lift, you can do whatever you want -- it's your own little box.
If there are two of you, you go into different corners, standing diagonally across from each other to create distance.
When a third person enters, you will unconsciously form a triangle. And when there is a fourth person it becomes a square, with someone in every corner. A fifth person is probably going to have to stand in the middle.
New comers to the lift will need to size up the situation when the doors slide open and then act decisively. Once in, for most people the rule is simple -- look down, or look at your phone.
