She creates a new language and teaches it to her friend, Jean. Mary and Jean like to talk to each other in their own language because they think no one understands them and it is funny. When they go shopping, they say things like: ""Look! He is fat."" ""This CD is awful."" ""I want to eat free hamburgers."" A clerk comes but he can't understand what they say.
