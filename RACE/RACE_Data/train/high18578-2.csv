Running
  No other exercise will help you lose weight faster than running. It also strengthens your heart, lungs, and leg muscles. But it can hurt your joints. If you feel pain in your knees, you need to stop and choose a different activity.
Walking
  This activity puts less stress on the body than running. But to see results you need to get your heart beating faster. This means you'll need to walk fast.
Swimming

Cycling
  Riding a bicycle will help you lose weight and work your leg muscles. But be careful! If you live in the city, stay on bike path, away from traffic. Or you can ride indoors on a stationary bike.
