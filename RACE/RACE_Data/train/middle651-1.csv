1,A,"['Talking about weather', 'Keeping silent', ""Asking each other's name"", 'Talking what they eat']",_  is a common way to begin a talk.,"Everyone talks about the weather, but no one does anything about it. It is true. People usually begin their talks with""Isn't it a nice day?""
Many people think they can tell what the weather is going to be like. But they hardly  agree with each other. One man may say,""Do you see how cloudy it is in the east? It's going to rain tomorrow.""Another man will say,""No, it's going to be fine tomorrow.""
People often look for the weather they want. When a farmer needs water, he looks for
something to tell him it's going to rain; he won't believe anything else. When friends have a travel, they are sure the weather is going to clear up very quickly.
