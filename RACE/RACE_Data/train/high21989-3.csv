3,B,"['Being a Good Father', ""Father's Day"", ""Dodd's Father"", 'Showing Love to Your Father']",What's the best title for this passage?,"It's time to do something for your father - the man who for many people has been an encouragement and support since birth.
The third Sunday of June is Father's Day. The holiday honors not only fathers, but also all men who act as father figures, such as stepfathers, uncles and grandfathers. 
The idea of Father's Day came from the love and appreciation of American lady called Sonore Smart Dodd in 1909.
Dodd wanted a special day to honor her father, William Smart. He raised six children by himself on a countryside farm in Washington State after his wife died during the birth of their sixth child.
When Dodd became an adult, she realized the selflessness her father has shown in raising his children as a single parent.
It was her father who did all for his children. In the eyes of his daughter, William Smart was a courageous, selfless and loving man.
Dodd's father was born in June, so she chose to hold the first Father's Day celebration in Washington on June 19th, 1910.
In 1924, US President Calvin Coolidge supported the idea of a national Father's Day. Finally, in 1966, President Lyndon Johnson declared the third Sunday of June as Father's day.
So this is a perfect chance to let your father know what he means to you. To show your love and respect, you need not buy an expensive gift. You can send him a home - made card; You can call him every day; Even you can give him a sweet smile when he comes back from work. All these little things are easy for us to do, but they can show your care and love to your father.",high21989.txt
