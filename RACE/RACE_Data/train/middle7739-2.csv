2,C,"['Because he lived near there', 'Because he had a good friend there', 'Because he thought it would make a change from sitting by the seaside', 'Because he wanted to enjoy the fresh air in the country']",Why did Alan decide to spend his holiday at Willow Farm?,"Alan worked in an office in the city. He worked very hard and really wanted to take a
holiday. He usually went to the seaside, but one day he saw an ad in a newspaper. ""Enjoy
country life. Spend a few weeks at Willow Farm. Good food, fresh air, horse riding, walking,
fishing. Good prices ."" ""This sounds like a good idea,"" he thought. ""I'll spend a month at
Willow Farm. I'll enjoy horse riding, walking and fishing. They'll make a change from sitting by
the seaside.""
Four days later he returned home.
""What's wrong with Willow Farm?"" his friend Jack asked him. ""Didn't you enjoy country
life?""
""Country life was fine,"" Alan said, ""but there was another problem .""
""Oh, what?""
""Well, the first day I was there a sheep died, and we had roast mutton   for dinner.""
""Fresh meat is the best.""
""I know, but on the second day a cow died, and we had roast beef for dinner.""
""Lucky you!""
""You don't understand,"" Alan said. ""On the third day a pig died and we had roast pork for
dinner."" '
""A different roast every day,"" Jack said.
""Let me finish,"" Alan said, ""on the fourth day the farmer died and I didn't dare to stay for
dinner!""",middle7739.txt
