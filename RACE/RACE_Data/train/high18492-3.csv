3,A,"['Entertainment.', 'Science.', 'Medicine.', 'News.']",In which part of a magazine can we read the passage?,"Sunshine is a great film, which takes us on a voyage into space when mankind is in danger. 
In 2057, our Sun is dying and mankind faces extinction. A spaceship named IcarusII, carries an enormous bomb to return life to the dying star. 
As the movie begins, the spacecraft is approaching the Sun. Suddenly, the operating system is out of control;then the crew receive a frightening signal from the original IcarusI which was sent to carry out the same task seven years ago. Should the crew continue flying to the Sun in the endangered ship? The question is not so much about whether any crew member can survive--the chances of that hardly exist--but should they try to grab the other bomb in IcarusI and take it to the Sun? Two shots at saving mankind are obviously better than one. 
After the decision is made, a crew member makes a mistake that places the mission in extreme danger. More accidents occur, and the crew face a difficult situation:there isn't enough oxygen for them on the ship.  www.ks5u.com
Among the most exciting scenes is a space walk by Capa and Kaneda when the ship's shield is damaged and must be inspected and repaired. 
Then when docked with IcarusI, the crew find it will be difficult for them to achieve the goal of the voyage. The film reaches its climax when the computer in IcarusI detects the presence of an unknown crew member. 
Indeed, the major task of the flight is to take back the world by restarting the failing Sun. However, Sunshine also makes clear the psychological and physical danger of space travel.",high18492.txt
