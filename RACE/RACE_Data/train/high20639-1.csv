1,D,"['Paul hid his secret of success', ""Paul knew his boss wasn't smart"", ""the boss didn't understand what Paul said"", 'the boss disagreed with what Paul had said']","From the dialogue between Paul and the boss, we can infer that   _  .","My son Paul got a job in a large chain   of guitar stores. It was the first time for him to do such a job. The pay was based on a small salary and his sales. They offered him some training on how to get close to a customer, introduce the product and make the sale. However, he wasn't doing well. He was very  _ .
One morning Paul said to me, ""Mum, you used to be a sales trainer. Can you tell me why I'm not doing well?"" I said, ""The key is that you must love the people you are selling your product to, not count the money you will make in your mind. Do what is best for them even though they are just buying something small or a cheap guitar.""
He promised he would try it. After some time, his sales began to increase. He became the top salesman in the store and his salary was increased. Within six months, he was one of the top ten salespeople in the whole chains of guitar stores around the country.
His company held a big party to honor the top ten salespeople. New cars, great hotels and delicious dinners were the prizes. Paul was of course included. After the dinner, the boss of the company asked, ""Paul, how did you make it?""
Paul answered, "" I don't want to tell you. You won't believe me.""
""Of course I'll believe you. Tell me.""
""I started loving the people who came in,"" Paul told him.
The boss replied, ""Okay Paul, now tell me how you REALLY make it.""",high20639.txt
