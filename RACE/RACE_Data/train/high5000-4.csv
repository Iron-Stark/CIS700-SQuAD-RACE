4,A,"['Sleep Matters', 'Disadvantage of Sleeping Binge', 'Advantage of Routine Naps', 'How to Sleep Well']",What would be the best title for the passage?,"Ceaseless technology. A punishing workweek. That to -do list that keeps multiplying. It is no wonder many of us find it difficult to have a sufficient amount of sleep. But will sleeping more on the weekend make up for hours of lost snoozing  ? One sleep expert, W. Christopher Winter raised the question.
Sleeping binge
Getting eight hours of shut-eye each night is generally recommended, but many people don't. As the week rolls from Monday to Friday, they accumulate a sleep debt. Spending a few extra hours in bed on a Saturday morning, people assume, will help them "" catch up"" on lost sleep. They're likely right, "" Nobody knows how long the horizon is, probably a few nights, but studies show that recovery sleep in the short term does work,"" says Dr. Winter, a member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.
Sleep banking
Recent data suggests that banking sleep in advance of a long night can actually offset   upcoming sleep deprivation . If you knew you were going to have to stay up all night on a particular day, for example, you could sleep for 10 hours a day for multiple days before the event, and be fine, Dr. Winter says. Just plan ahead.
Routine  naps
A scheduled nap is healthier than catching up on or banking sleep. "" Because sleep extension can make you feel groggy  , I always recommend a short nap [if a person feels they need it ], at the same time, every day,"" says Dr. Winter. He adds that 25 minutes is ideal. "" When you schedule a short nap, your body anticipates it and slows down, without falling into a deep dream sleep,"" he says. That refreshing, scheduled break is better than an occasional weekend lie-in. "" The body likes routine,"" he says, "" When it's prepared, it works more efficiently.""",high5000.txt
