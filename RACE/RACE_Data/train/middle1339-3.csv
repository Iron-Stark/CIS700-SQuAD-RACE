3,C,"['days', 'nights', 'trees', 'animals']",There are no   _   near the North Pole.,"Do you know Eskimos? Let me tell you something about their lives.
Eskimos live near the North Pole .There are only two seasons there, winter and summer.
There is no spring or autumn there. The winter nights are long. You can't see the sun for more than two months, even at midday. The summer days are long. For more than two months, the sun never goes down and there's no night.
Eskimos have warm clothes. They make their clothes from the skins of animals. From skins  they make coats, caps and shoes.
Near the North Pole trees can't grow, for it is too cold there. The Eskimos have to make their houses from skins, snow or stone. When they got out in storms and can't get back home, they make houses of snow. They leave these houses when the storm is over.
Life is hard for the Eskimos, but they still like to live there.",middle1339.txt
