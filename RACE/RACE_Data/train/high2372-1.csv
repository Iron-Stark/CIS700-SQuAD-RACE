1,B,"['Their major is the same, which is journalism.', 'Both of them want to go back to China after graduation.', 'Their parents are against their decision.', 'They are forced to study in a foreign land by their parents.']",What do Guo Gaoqi and Yang Fan have in common?,"Luo Gaoqi hopes to join the increasing number of Chinese students in the United States because he wants the experience of studying in a foreign land as it will help his future job at home. ""I want to try Western education because people there think differently,"" said the 21-year-old who is in his final year of undergraduate studies. ""I also hope to meet friends from different cultures. The social connections may help in the future.""
The latest report from the US-based institute of International Education said China, for the first time, has become the top country of origin for international students in the United States.
For Yang Fan, a journalism student, said studying in the United States is a way to escape the competition for places in China's top universities.
""Due to limited education resources, only about 60 percent of high school graduates in China enter college, and a much lower rate enters the top-level ones. ""A foreign degree will definitely help when I seek a job in China,"" Yang said.
Both Yang's and Luo's parents are supportive of them studying abroad. Neither of them is thinking of settling down in the United States after graduation.
""It is not realistic to do so. As a journalism student, there would be no advantage for me to work in the United States,"" Yang said. ""But in China, with a US degree and good English, I may stand out against other students who have only studied in China.""
China still needs to improve its environment for scientists and high-level talents, said Xiao Mingzheng, director of the Center for Human Resource Development and Management Research of Peking University, adding that, in particular, the country needs to improve its policies relating to research environments.
In June, the Chinese government published a plan concerning talent development for the next 10 years. In it, it has improved policies and increased budgets to attract talented students back home.",high2372.txt
