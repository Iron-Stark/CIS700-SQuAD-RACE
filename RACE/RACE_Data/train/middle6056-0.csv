0,B,"['The pencil.', 'The pen.', 'Jack.', 'The pencil box.']",Who is the king now?,"Jack is 10 years old, and I am his pencil. I'm Jack's helper .
Jack's pencil box is my home. I have some friends here. They are seven crayons, a ruler, a pencil-sharpener and an eraser. Because Jack loves me, I'm the king  in the pencil box. My friends and I are happy every day.
Today, I am not happy because a pen comes in. It's new and nice. It's a music pen. It can write and sing. But I'm old and I can only help Jack to write. Jack likes it very much! The new pen is his helper now. It's the new king. What can I do now? Shall I go to a new home?",middle6056.txt
