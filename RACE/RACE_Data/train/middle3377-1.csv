When we knew it might be his last birthday, the whole family decided to have a big birthday celebration at the nursing home.
Dad was a good storyteller. But this time I told Dad to listen to some stories for a change. One after another, people told stories from their hearts  , while Dad listened with tears   in eyes. People thought of kinds of stories-stories about when they were little, stories about when Dad was young.
Everyone seemed to have more than one story. Even the little grandchildren couldn't wait to tell Dad why they loved him. For a man who was kind to so many hundreds of people in his life, here was a change to tell him how much we love him.
