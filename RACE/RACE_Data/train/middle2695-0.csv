0,C,"['the same side in Beijing as', 'the right side of the road', 'the left side of the road', 'both sides of the road']",People drive on  _   in London.,"Dear Peter
How about your study? It's Sunday today. I'm writing a letter to you. I'm going to tell you something in Beijing.
Beijing is different from London. In our country, we drive on the left side of the road, but here people drive on the right side. Most people go to work by bus or by bike. The rush hours are from seven to nine in the morning and five to seven in the afternoon. People in China work around eight hours a day, five days a week. They usually begin to work at eight in the morning, and rest on Saturday and Sunday.
I have Chinese classes every morning from Monday to Friday. The students in our class are from many countries. We're all working hard and friendly to each other. The Chinese students are ready to help us with our Chinese. We also help them a lot with their English. We are getting along very well.
That's all for today. Please write to me soon.
Yours
