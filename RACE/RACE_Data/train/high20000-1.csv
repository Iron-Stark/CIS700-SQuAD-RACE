 But this time there was no superman to save the people or the famous building. The attack destroyed one of the world's highest skyscrapers and left 5,000 people dead or missing.
 Movie fans have become used to such events after years of Hollywood films showing disasters, terrorism  and danger, The Empire State Building, the White House, New York City and even the American president himself have all been threatened by terrorist attacks in these exciting films.
     The film""True Lies"", released  in 1994 is considered to be a good example of this kind of movie. The special effects, including explosions and missiles, make the action look like a real thing.
 ""Independence Day""in 1996 took this type of movie one step further by blowing up the White House. This science fiction movie is about a war between human beings and aliens  from another planet. In the movie, the WorldTradeCentertowers are destroyed.
 Violence has become a major part of Hollywood movies. And this is what people enjoy. Soon after the attacks, many famous film companies stopped the planned releases of some of their new movies, especially if their films showed terrorist attacks or plane crashes. ""Swordfish"" was top of the American box office in June, 2001. But the movie's story was frighteningly similar to the Sept.11 disaster. The film would have been stopped in American and British cinemas after the attack.
