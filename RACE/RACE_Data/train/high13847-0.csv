They form a natural border between Zimbabwe   and Zambia  .
The falls are named after Queen Victoria by Livingstone. They were known to the native people in the 18th century as: ""the smoke that thunders"". The waterfall is formed as the two-kilometer-wide Zambezi River spills   over the edge of its giant stone riverbed and falls into the gorge   below. At their highest point, the Victoria Falls drop a distance of 108m, almost twice as far as the Niagara Falls. As much as 546 million cubic meters of water per minute falls over the edge from that height.
Viewing the falls from the Zambian side means that visitors can follow a path that goes right up to the falls. The falls can also be viewed from the Boiling Pot, right in the depths of the gorge at the bottom of the falls. The 111-meter-high Victoria Falls Bridge, a railway crossing, is now a popular place for Bungee jumping. It can be crossed on foot for excellent views of the falls and the winding blue-green waters of the Zambezi River. It is also possible to see the falls from a plane.
The area around the falls is a major game-viewing place. The best time to view the Victoria Falls is between December and July, when the water level is the highest.
