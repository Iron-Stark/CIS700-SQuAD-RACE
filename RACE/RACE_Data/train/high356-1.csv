1,D,"['They are all of the same age.', 'They are as famous as Kid Cudi and Eminem.', 'There are five members in the band.', 'They have fans around the world.']",What do we know about KTD?,"A group of teenagers: they laugh and talk over each other, dance and make faces -- you wouldn't believe they had just played on the same stage as famous American singers Kid Cudi and Eminem.
These seven kids, all under the age of 20, are members of the band Kids These Days (KTD).
Fresh out of high school, the band already has done things that most teens couldn't even imagine. They played at festivals including the recent SXSW in Austin and Lollapalooza in their hometown, Chicago, to crowds of loyal fans.
KTD uses a mix of hip-hop, jazz, blues and classic rock to make a sound of their own.
""KTD simply mixes most, if not all of my favourite music styles,"" said Kamia Jones, as Chicago high school student.""I like that they aren't afraid to be different and that their music is real and speaks to the soul.""
The band formed two years ago. Now, as well as local fans, they are becoming popular around the world. Their facebook page is filled with supportive posts from admirers from California to Tokyo.
""It's really strange to me that people from London, Australia and Russia... They have heard
of us and they like our music because it's really cool feeling,"" says Marcie Stewart, who plays keyboard for the band.
Despite their recent fame, KTD is a group of normal teenagers and they remain very close to one another. While talking to the reporters, they dance and make fun of each other.
When asked what advice they would give to other teen musicians, Greg Landfair, KTD's drummer, said, ""Keep your heart in it. Never lose the music and what you are doing, because that's what you're here for. Let the music always be first.""",high356.txt
