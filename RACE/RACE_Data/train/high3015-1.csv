It is one of life's frequent affairs: You hand over some money; you might get change; you drive off.
Late one morning in 1984, headed for lunch in San Francisco, I drove toward a booth. I heard loud music. It sounded like a party. I looked around. No other cars with their windows open. No sound trucks. I looked at the toll booth. Inside it, the man was dancing.

""I'm having a party,"" he said.
""What about the rest of the people?"" I looked at the other toll booths.
He said, ""What do those look like to you?"" He pointed down the row of toll booths.

I can see the Golden Gate, San Francisco, and the Berkeley hills. Half the Western world vacations here......and I just stroll in every day and practice dancing.""",high3015.txt
