3,D,"['increasing homework', 'changing schools', 'changing teachers', 'reducing homework']",Some education reformers think we should improve our school education by  _  .,"People hold different views on what or how much homework should be. It is partly due to  the fact that people can't seem to agree on the purpose of homework.
Some teachers think that homework is necessary to reinforce  what is learned in school. And so they ask their students to memorize what was discussed in class through homework. Some teachers think the point of homework is to cover material that the class didn't have time to get to, so their homework is to let students learn additional things. Other teachers like homework simply because they want students to form work habits and still others believe homework is necessary because it's the best way for parents to learn what their children do in school.
However, many parents seem to have different ideas. Elisa Cohen, who has twins at Lafayette Elementary School, doesn't like the fact that third-grade students in DC elementary schools are asked to write about 25 book summaries a year. She said, ""They do the same thing over and over without really getting into alternate   ways of thinking about books, reading and writing.""
Some education reformers  , such as Howard Gardner, a Harvard University professor well-known for his theory on multiple intelligence, think that Cohen is on the right track. But it's often hard to persuade overworked teachers to give much thought to homework tasks.",high12650.txt
