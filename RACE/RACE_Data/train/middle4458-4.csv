People like the person who is willing to act on their sudden inspiration to create something particular. Think of the things and people that have affected you most deeply. They moved you because their creations were caused by inspiration, not desperation . The world is changed not by those who do similar work before them but by those who do creative work. Creative people are full of new ideas. The problem a creator faces is not running out of material; It is what to do with the material to knock at the door of imagination.
Study your role models, accept the gifts they have given and leave behind what does not serve you. Then you can say, ""If I have announced my success, it's by learning lessons from my ancestors' failure.""",middle4458.txt
