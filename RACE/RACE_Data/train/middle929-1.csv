1,B,"['She ws afraid she would fall', 'She was too far away from the pool', 'She thought the bees would follow her', ""She didn't want her face to be unprotected""]",At first why didn't the writer want to climb down the rocks?,"It was a very hot afternoon,and we decided to cool off in the river near my home.As we climbed down a small rocky hill toward the water, my boyfriend John suddenly started to shout,then jumped into the water below. Peter and Mary quickly followed but I was too far away to jump. I was strapped.
I heard a low hum  , which was growing louder .From a distance,the group of bees looked almost like a cloud of smoke.As it got closer,I realized it was actually thousands of bees flying towards me.
All I could do was cover my face with hands.Crazily I thought that if I sat very still(  ),the bees would think I was just another rock.
After a few seconds,I knew my plan hadn't worked.The bees were attacking me. I could hear my friends shouting at me to get down to the pool fast.
But it wasn't easy.I was in great pain and the only way I could get away was to use my hands to climb down to the rocks.However, I was afraid to do that at first because my face would be unprotected.The noise the bees made was so loud and frightening ,but I had no choice.
I rushed down the rocks and jumped into the pool,but I don't remember doing it.I was just so happy to be free from the pain. I was safe,and the water felt wonderful.
But we still weren't out of danger. Every time we tried to climb out of the pool,the bees flew back over our heads.We spent the next three hours in the water, putting our heads under the water from time to time to avoid the bees until they finally lost interest.",middle929.txt
