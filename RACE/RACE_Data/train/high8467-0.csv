0,B,"['Because he had no courage to face his shortcomings.', ""Because he never thought he had so many annoyances in his wife's eyes."", ""Because he was sorry that he didn't find any annoyance about his wife."", ""Because he didn't think he deserved to have such a perfect wife.""]",Why were there tears in the husband's eyes when the wife read his annoyances?,"A man and his girlfriend were married. It was a large celebration. All of their friends and family came to see the lovely ceremony. Everyone could tell that the love they had for each other was true.
A few months later, the wife came to the husband with a piece of advice, ""I read in a magazine, a while ago, about how we can strengthen our marriage,"" she offered. ""Each of us will write a list of the things that we find a bit annoying with the other person. Then, we can talk about how we can fix them together and make our lives happier together.""
The husband agreed. So each of them tried to think of the things that annoyed them about the other and wrote down what they came up with. The next morning, at the breakfast table, they decided that they would go over their lists.
""I'll start,"" offered the wife. She took out her list. It had many items on it, enough to fill three pages. In fact, as she started reading the list of the little annoyances, she noticed that tears were starting to appear in her husband's eyes because he never thought that he had so many shortcomings.
The wife continued to read until she had read all three pages to her husband. ""Now, you read your list and then we'll talk about the things on both of our lists,"" she said happily.
Quietly the husband stated, ""I don't have anything on my list. I think that you are perfect. I don't want you to change anything for me. You are lovely and wonderful and I wouldn't want to try and change anything about you."" The wife, touched by his honesty and the depth of his love for her and his acceptance of her, turned her head and wept.
In life, there are enough times when we are disappointed, depressed and annoyed. We don't really have to go looking for them. We have a wonderful world that is full of beauty, light and promise. Why waste time in this world looking for the bad, disappointing or annoying when we can look around us and see the wonderful things before us?",high8467.txt
