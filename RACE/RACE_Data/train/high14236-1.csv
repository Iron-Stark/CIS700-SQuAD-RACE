The guidelines, released on Wednesday, advise that both adults and children cut back on their sugar intake  to stay healthy.
In a statement, Francesco Branca, director of the WHO's nutrition department, said there is evidence that reducing daily sugar intake reduces the risk of being overweight and tooth decay .
The guidelines do not apply to the sugars in fresh fruit and vegetables or those that are naturally present in milk. According to the WHO, there is no reported evidence of negative effects of consuming those sugars. Instead, the new guidelines focus on ""added"" or ""free"" sugars. These include sugars that are added to processed foods and drinks such as candy and soft drinks.
Added sugars are sometimes described as "" hidden"" sugars because they exist in foods we might not think of as sweets, such as honey and ketchup . Health experts advise that consumers look at ingredients on food packages to help make better-informed decisions.
The WHO recommends that people in the United States, Europe and other Western societies should cut their average sugar intake by about two-thirds, or down to just 10% of their overall calories. For developing countries, where dental care is less advanced, the WHO recommends that sugar intake be reduced to 5%.
Scientist Kieran Clarke, of the University of Oxford, notes that for those people who can't shake their love for sweets, getting more exercise is a good solution. ""If you get enough exercise, you can eat almost anything,"" she said ""But it's very hard to avoid large amounts of sugar unless all you're eating is fruit and vegetables.""",high14236.txt
