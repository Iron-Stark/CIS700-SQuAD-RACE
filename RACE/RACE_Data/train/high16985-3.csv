3,B,"['With the help of his assistants.', 'By experiment and comparison.', 'Through interviews and questionnaires.', 'By cooperating with some teachers.']",How did Mr.Dweck reach his conclusion?,"If your child does well on a test,of course,you're going to praise or her-but if you focus too often on achievements, children may not get the right message.Why?
An experiment by psychologist Carol Dweck at Columbia University in New York shows what happens when kids are praised for their efforts,and what happens when they're praised for their intelligence.
Dweck got a group of ten--yearolds to do a series of puzzles easy enough so that all could do them well.Then they were told either,""You must be smart at this,""or,""You must have worked really hard.""
In the following tests,the kids praised for their efforts chose to do a harder set of puzzles.when give a task two years beyond their grade levels ,they worked hard and enjoyed the challenge , even when they didn't succeed. And in a final test at the same level as the first ,their scores improved by 25 percent. And the ""smart"" kids? They refused to try the harder puzzles, choosing the one that guaranteed them good scores. When they did work in the ""too hard"" tests , they became discouraged and upset. And when retested with the original puzzles, their scores declined by 20 percent.
Dweck's conclusion:""When we praise kids for their intelligence,we tell them:  'Look smart,don't risk making mistakes.'""By contrast,""emphasizing effort gives children an inspiring factor that they can control.""",high16985.txt
