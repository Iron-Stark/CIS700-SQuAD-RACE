The technology of inlaying jade into metal can date back to the Han Dynasty almost 2,000 years ago.It is not easy to bond jade perfectly with metal.The key to the process lies in the inner layer of the metal and the groove of the jade ring.A seal ring is put between the inner layer and the groove to join the metal and jade together.
Jade rings used for casting Olympic medals have been subjected to strict quality controls,and those not up to the standard have been thrown away.
To make use of those jade rings that do meet the quality criteria,metal medals were produced to fit the jade tings,and more than ten different sizes of seal rings were designed.
To avoiding any loosening of the jade rings due to aging of the seals,glue has been used in casting the;Olympic medals,which is a painstaking manual process.
Experts from the International Olympic Committee(IOC)were concerned about the risk of fragility when the jade ring design was proposed.The IOC required that jade rings should be strong enough to withstand a 2-meter drop test.The Shanghai Mint raised that standard to 3- meters.Medals call survive a 3-meter drop test with only minor cracks on the jade rings.",high16791.txt
