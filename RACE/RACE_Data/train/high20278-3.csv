3,A,"['Big day for Fiaui--a new Canadian', 'The story of Fiaui, a firefighter', 'Canada Day--the day to celebrate independence and freedom', 'A five-year journey of Fiaui']",Which of the following might be the best title?,"BIG DAY: New Canadian citizen Pemelika Fiaui poses with his son Tyler, 4, outside of The Playhouse on Tuesday.
       The ceremony marked the end of a five-year journey for Pemelika Fiaui of Western Samoa.
       Fiaui, a 6'4"", 240-pound member of local rugby team Black Spruce, said the day was emotional.
       ""I was really happy to get my citizenship today; it was a long process,"" he said. ""I couldn't have done this without the support of my wife, my in-laws and my two kids, who have been so supportive of me.""
       Fiaui, a firefighter by trade, arrived in New Brunswick in 2003 and found work with the parks and trails department with the City of Fredericton. He became involved with the local rugby scene, and for the past three years is back in his chosen field as a relief firefighter with the Fredericton Fire Department.
       ""I've met so many great people since I've been in Fredericton, and this is a very special day for me and my family. I'm happy to be a Canadian, but I'm also glad that I still hold dual   citizenship in Western Samoa as well.""
       The citizenship ceremony was overseen by a number of dignitaries , including Lt.-Gov. Hermenegilde, Chiasson, MP Andy Scott, Mayor Brad Woodside and John Barrett, director of operations for Citizenship and Immigration Canada.
       Chiasson joked by welcoming the new Canadians ""to the country that invented ice skates, maple syrup and the case of beer with the built-in handle.""
       The day was also special for Jean-Jacques Tshimenga, his wife Sarah, and their three children, formerly of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
       ""Canada Day is the day to celebrate the independence and freedom that we have in this country,"" he said.",high20278.txt
