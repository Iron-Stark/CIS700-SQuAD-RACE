Teens who take in less vitamin E, found in vegetable oil and nuts, are more likely to have asthma , Jane Bums at the Harvard School of Public Health found.

Proper amounts of fatty acids are protective, Bums said, though fish, the best source of fatty acids, is particularly unpopular with teenagers.Fatty acids are also found in some nuts as well as some green vegetables'.Smokers who avoid vitamin C will increase their chances of coughing, wheezing and developing phlegm .
More than 80 percent of teens are getting their recommended doses of vitamin C - mainly from fruit drinks.""I wouldn't approve of drinking them, but at least they're getting their vitamin C from somewhere,"" Burns said.
