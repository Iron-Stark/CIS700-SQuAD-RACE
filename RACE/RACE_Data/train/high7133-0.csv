He asked if I would give him some money so he could get something to eat. After a short hesitation, I shook my head and kept walking. With helplessness, he said, ""I really am homeless and I really am hungry! You can come with me and watch me eat!"" But still, I kept on walking.
The incident bothered me for the rest of the week. In fact, I had money in my pocket and it wouldn't have killed me to hand over a dollar or two even if he had been lying. On a freezing cold night, I wondered what would happen to a hungry man.
Flying back to my hometown, Anchorage, I couldn't help thinking of him. I tried to find excuses for my failure to help. After all, government agencies, churches and charities were there to feed him. Besides, you're not supposed to give money to beggars.
But I just couldn't forget the incident and began to think I must do something. At that time, I was writing a garden column  for the local Daily News. Suddenly, I came up with an idea.
