Come to Xinxin zoo to see the Australian koalas and lions from South Africa. The American tigers are waiting for you. Do you want to see penguins? They are kind of interesting. We also have very cute pandas, but they are a little shy, so please be very quiet. You can play with the dolphins. They are smart and cute. Do you like the giraffes? They are fun. And there are many other animals, too. It's really exciting!
