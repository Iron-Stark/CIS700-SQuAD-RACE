0,B,"['wo', 'Three', 'Four', 'Five']",How many ways of keeping a healthy lifestyle are mentioned in the passage?,"Most people hope to have a memory which helps them succeed in study, work and life. Can memory be improved? Luckily, hundreds of studies in the past 50 years have already given us a definite* answer.
A healthy lifestyle keeps your brain young and memory sharp. First of all, it is necessary to have a healthy diet. Eating more food rich in B vitamins and Vitamin E, such as vegetables and lean meat, helps you have a better memory. Doing exercise can keep your brain alive, too. Proper exercise provides much needed oxygen for the brain. Running ,riding a bike ,swimming and even walking two or three times a week are helpful. Moreover, getting enough sleep is important. Only when your brain gets a good rest, can it work well. The healthier your lifestyle is, the better your memory will become, but do not expect a sudden change---it takes a long time to make a difference.
Memory skills help you remember things better. The following three are the most widely used. Chunking* is a way of remembering a piece of information by cutting it into smaller ones. For example, to memorize a ten--digit telephone number 2127983630,you can divide the digits into three groups: first 212,then 798,and lastly 3630.This method is far more effective than remembering a string* of 10 digits. Organization means organizing information into groups of the the same kind. For example, trees, grass and flowers are plants; tigers, panadas, horses and cows are animals ,Imagery is remembering newly learnt information by using your imagination and connecting it with something that you are familiar with.
However, memory skills will hardly work if you don't understand the information. What's more, only a regular review can make the memory last long. That is why students are always advised to go over what they have learnt after one day and then after three days, and then use it as regularly as possible.
Human brains are like muscles that need nutrients and exercise to become stronger. If you make a few lifestyle changes and try some memory skills, you can certainly improved your memory.",middle3006.txt
