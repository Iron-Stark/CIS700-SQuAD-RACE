1,C,"['Satisfied.', 'Puzzled.', 'Disappointed.', 'Excited.']",How did the mother feel when hearing her daughter's first answer?,"A mother of a cheerful five-year-old just returned from a meeting of the National Organization for Women. Inspired by exciting dreams for the possibilities of womanhood, she asked her daughter what she wanted to be when she grew up. Little Lisa quickly answered, ""A nurse.""
There was a time when nursing was thought of as a woman's job and the answer somehow seemed not to be satisfied. She had, after all, just returned from a new meeting.
""You can be anything you want to be,"" she reminded her daughter. ""You can be a lawyer, a doctor, a banker, president of the country -- you can be anything.""
""Anything?"" Lisa asked.
""Anything!"" her mother smiled.
""I know,"" Lisa said. ""I want to be a horse!""
Lisa's dream may need some improvement, but there is plenty of time for that. When do we give up dreaming about the future? When do we resign   ourselves to simply replaying dreams from the past?
Maybe her dream needs to mature   a bit, but would you rather have the optimism   of a five-year-old girl who wants to be a horse, or the pessimism   of an adult who says in despair, ""I can't be anything at all""?
Teddy Roosevelt said, _ believe that is the way to make those dreams come true. It begins with looking up and dreaming of something beautiful.",high6934.txt
