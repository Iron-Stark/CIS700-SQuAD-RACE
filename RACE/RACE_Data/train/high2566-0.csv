It is taken between four and five. If you are a friend of the family, you may come for tea at any time. Very often it is not taken at a table. The members of the family and visitors take the tea in the sitting room. Each person has a cup and saucer  , a spoon   and a small plate for bread and butter   and cakes.

Do remember: Though you can eat as much as you want, do not put more than  one piece of bread or cake on your plate each time.",high2566.txt
