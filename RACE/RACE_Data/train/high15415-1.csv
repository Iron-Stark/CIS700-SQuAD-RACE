sometimes. Seeing an injured seal wrapped in a blanket at a marine  mammal center gave Haley Humes and Hayley Jeffries an idea for a special Girl Scout project. They decided to make blankets to keep injured animals warm. They would give these blankets to the Pacific Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach, California.
""We knew we wanted to help animals,"" Haley said. ""We went to the center to ask questions about what they needed. They don't have a heated floor, and all the babies crowded together to stay warm.""
Friends since kindergarten, Haley and Hayley made 12 blankets to keep the Marine Mammal Center's seals and sea lions warm. Using fun images like Winnie-the-Pooh, the girls took two hours to make each blanket. The first sea lion to test out a blanket looked pretty in pink.
""It was a sick baby and really liked it,"" Haley said. ""It curled up in it right away.""
""The blankets are beautiful and the animals love them!"" said the Mammal Center's Michele Hunter. ""It's nice to see children taking pride in their work and doing something to help animals.""
During the project, the girls took dozens of pictures for the PowerPoint presentations they gave to Girl Scout leaders. Those presentations helped Haley and Hayley raise $250 to buy additional supplies the center needed.
This was the first project the girls ever worked on and took months to plan and carry out.
""I learned that in order to make something happen, you have to take it slowly and step by step,"" Hayley said. Just as important, the girls discovered that two people really can make a difference. ""Knowing you're making a difference......with these animals is amazing,"" Haley said. ""It was like the animals became my new friends.""
The Pacific Marine Mammal Center cares for sea lions and seals, as well as for other marine mammals. Since opening in 1971,the center has saved more than 5,000 injured marine mammals.",high15415.txt
