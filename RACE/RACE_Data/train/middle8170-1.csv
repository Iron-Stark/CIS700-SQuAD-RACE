1,B,"['God was kind to him', 'the second man prayed for him', 'God thought he was unlucky', 'the second man prayed for nothing']",The first man could get all the things because    _   .,"A ship met a storm at sea and only two of the men were able to swim to a small, deserted island. Not knowing what else to do, they agreed to pray  to God on opposite sides of the island.
Of course, the first thing they prayed for was food. The next morning, the first man saw a fruit tree on his side. But there was nothing on the other man's side.
Later the first man prayed for a house, clothes and more food. The next day, all of these things were given to him. However, the second man still had nothing.
Finally, the first man prayed for a ship so that he could leave the island, and the next morning he found a ship.
The first man decided to leave alone. As the ship was about to leave, the first man heard a voice, ""Why are you leaving your friend on island?""
""My
gs are mine alone, since I was the one that prayed for them,"" the first man answered. ""His prayers were all unanswered.""
""You are wrong!"" the voice said. ""He had only one prayer, which I answered. If not for that, you would not have received any of our blessings.""
""Tell me"", the first man asked, ""what he prayed for?""
""He prayed that all your prayers would be answered.""
For all we know, our blessings are not the fruits of our prayers alone, but those of others' prayers for us",middle8170.txt
