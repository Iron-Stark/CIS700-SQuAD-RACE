2,D,"['How to grow vegetables in hot areas.', 'How to grow crops in tropical climates.', 'How to cool the soil.', 'How to use sea water.']",What is the report mainly about?,"Did you know that vegetables can grow in the climates they are not used to? Cool climate vegetables like asparagus   are now able to be grown in places as hot as Hawaii. In Hawaii, marine  engineers have been able to actually let you believe such vegetables that they are living in cooler climates. In that way they grow faster and taste better. What these engineers have been using is very simply cold sea water. How did they use it? They place pipes in the soil and cold water flowing through them cools the earth. This causes plant growth and enables gardeners in tropical climates   to grow crops from cooler climates. Also some of these pipes are exposed to the air and they make the air ""wet"" and thus water the gardens. What especially makes people happy about this process   is that nothing to the natural conditions is being used. Another new use for cold ocean water is to cool buildings. Engineers believe that for example the entire west coast of the prefix = st1 /United Statescould be air-conditioned using seawater.",high22890.txt
