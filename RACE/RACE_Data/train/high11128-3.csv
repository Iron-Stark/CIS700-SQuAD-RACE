3,C,"['The new high-speed railway line is good for all people to go home.', 'The new high-speed railway line benefits businessmen to carry goods.', 'Taking the new train is safer than driving home from Urumqi to Lanzhou.', 'Businessmen seldom went home for Spring Festival before.']",Which of the following is true according to the passage?,"The new high-speed railway line between Urumqi,capital of the Xinjiang Uygur self-governing region,and Lanzhou,capital of Gansu province,has cut train travel time by half to less than 12 hours.
The dramatic improvement will benefit many families planning reunions for Spring Festival.

The 1,776-km line,which passes through Qinghai province and is the country's first    high-speed railway to be built in a high-altitude region,came into service on Dec 26.
""We normally drive home for Spring Festival to avoid the difficulties of buying seven train tickets for the whole family during the peak season,""Liang said.""Driving can be very tiring and dangerous sometimes,so one year we even decided not to go back to Lanzhou simply to avoid the trip.""
More than 600,000 passengers traveled on the line during its first month,and the Urumqi Railway Bureau said the introduction of high-speed services will ease transport pressure during the Spring Festival peak season.
The existing usual railway line could no longer support Xinjiang's development.All    passenger trains will gradually shift to the new link,leaving the old one to be used for goods.As a result,Xinjiang's annual goods ability could reach 200 million metric tons from the current 70 million.
The line passes through areas that experience high winds,and it also crosses parts of the    deserted Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the bone-dry sands of the Gobi Desert.
