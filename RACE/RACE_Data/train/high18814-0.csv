0,D,"['1%', '5%', '23.5%', '20%']","According to the estimation, what is the percentage of illegal fishing?","Experts estimate that one out of every five fish sold was caught illegally. It threatens  food security and hurts the environment. Officials are using new observational technology to fight illegal fishing.
""Thank you for taking the time to join us here in Harwell (UK) in the Operations Center to what we call 'Project Eyes on the Seas.'"" says Tony Long, who leads the Ending Illegal Fishing program for Pew Charitable Trusts. The group created Project Eyes on the Seas. Large three-dimensional images of a globe can be seen on a video.
""It looks different from what you might expect because this globe only shows you the boats that are coming into this system from a live automated information system or AIS.""
The screen shows 120,000 fishing boats have AIS. They are required to have the technology. But those who are fishing illegally often turn it off. The technology does not tell observers when that happens. Project Eyes on the Seas combines satellite information with secret government records on every ship's past activities.
Mr. Long says that permits researchers to understand exactly where the fishing boats are operating. The Pew team gives the information it gathers to port officials to help them decide if they should take action against a ship. Tony Long says he would like to be able to provide port officials all over the world with clear lists. They would inform the officials about ships to inspect, ships to bar from entrance, and ships to permit entrance for trade activities.
The Pacific island nation of Palau was an early user of the technology. Palau has one of the richest fishing areas in the world. Last year, it announced a plan to ban commercial fishing in a 630,000 square kilometer area. K.B. Sakuma is a special adviser to the president of Palau. He says Palau is trying to deal with a recent increase in illegal, unsupervised and unreported fishing.
""And it's come to a head in the last year or two. From our southern island in the evening you can see on the horizon just dotted lights of these illegal fishermen that come into our waters, fill their ships with our fish, our resources, our food security...""",high18814.txt
