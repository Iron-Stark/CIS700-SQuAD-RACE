1,A,"['Ma Moomia May', 'Muckamoo Mee', 'Randy and his parents', 'the cows of Cobblonia']",On the top of the cliff lived   _  .,"The cows of Cobblonia Kingdom lived in a large field. This field had a lot of rich and green grass. There was water on three sides and a cliff to the east. The cliff was as tall as the sky and as steep as a wall.
On the top of the cliff lived a very special cow. All the other cows called him ""Ma Moomia May"" It meant ""The Wise One"" in the old language. Nobody knew much about him, and nobody ever asked anything about him, except for one cow.
His name was Randy, but all the other cows called him ""Muckamoo Mee"". It meant ""The Annoying One"". Randy never stopped asking questions. He woke up with many new questions to ask his parents every morning.
""Why is the sky blue?"" Randy asked his dad.
""Nobody knows,"" said Randy's dad.
""Then how do we know it won't be yellow or red tomorrow?"" Randy asked another question.
""I can't spend all day answering your questions, Randy why don't you go and play in the stream?""
He did so.
""How does the grass grow?"" Randy asked his mom the next day.
