0,D,"['They often get dirty when eating.', 'They often refuse to take a shower.', 'They often read stories to their children while sleeping.', 'They love their children too much and ask for nothing in return.']",What do we know about the Chinese parents?,"Where has the Time gone? is the hottest song that has moved thousands of Chinese. Chinese parents give their children endless love and want nothing from them. However, sometimes, daughters and sons are too busy growing up and forget that their parents are getting older and older. What should  we do? Let's have a look at a letter of a father's.
Dear son,
One day if you see me old and I am not myself, have patience and try to understand me. If I get dirty when eating.. ., if I cannot dress.. ., have patience. Remember the hours I spent teaching it to you. If, when I speak to you, I say the same things one thousand and one times, do not stop me and listen to me. When you were small, I had to read to you one thousand and one times the same story until you get to sleep.
When I do not want to have a shower, neither shame me nor scold  me. Remember when I had to chase you with a thousand excuses I made, in order that you wanted to bath.
When you see me meet something new, give me the necessary time and don't laugh at me. I taught you how to do so many things _  to eat well, to dress well... to face life.
If I do not want to eat, do not force me. I know well when I need to and when not. When my legs do not allow me to walk, give me your hand the same way I did when you gave your first steps.
When sometimes I lose the memory during our conversation, let me have the necessary time to remember. And if I cannot do it, do not become nervous because the most important thing is not my conversation but to be with you and to have you listen to me.
Yours,
Father",middle4129.txt
