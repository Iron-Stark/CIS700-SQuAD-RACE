0,D,"['personal possessions', 'American culture', 'personal rights', 'gun control']",The writer's purpose is to give his opinion about  _  .,"As a foreigner,I don' t know the situation in the US well. Seeing all kinds of recent shooting incidents,I think it should be controlled more strictly than now. Somebody said that the person who has it in mind to kill another can do it without a gun,so the causes of murders are not guns but the trend of despising   life in the US. And they also insist that there is no clear evidence that the increasing number of murders is connected with possession  of guns,so the personal rights should not be restricted  by the reason that there is not enough evidence.
Several months ago,I agreed with that partly. But as we know,the private groups like NRA have used the public opinion and persuaded the government to protect their profit. Other weapons such as knives,razors ,bats are made for their own usage. But guns are made for only one reason--to kill someone. Of course,there are people who have guns to protect themselves from the criminals. But crime is getting more cruel and severe nowadays,so actually even if someone has a gun,it is impossible to guard himself completely.
As a substitute ,I think,if the possession of guns is controlled more strictly,people can live safer lives than now. There are other reasons to oppose the gun control (e.g.the possession of guns is historical inheritance  and represents that people's resistance  will be against tyrannical   government),but none of them can justify and explain today's serious situation in the US.",high22677.txt
