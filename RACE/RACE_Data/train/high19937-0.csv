0,C,"['Lack of international cooperation.', 'Not sharing timely information.', 'Lack of professional equipment.', 'Too many natural disasters.']",What is China's most urgent problem to be deal with in rescue work according to the passage?,"Weeks have passed since the world lost contact with Malaysia Airlines flightMH370and its 239passengers and crew.
Although there is little hope of finding any of the passengers and crew alive,China has been making all-out efforts to find what remains of the plane in the southern Indian Ocean,where the plane is believed to have crashed.The search operations involve the navy,the marine police,scientific research and so on.While China's authorities and military forces have passed the test,the search operations have also shown some weaknesses.It is necessary to address these problems because China is a nation that faces many natural disasters.
Lack of professional equipment has been the most notable problem.Among all the ships involved in the search for MH370,only Nanhai jiu 115and Donghai jiu 101and a few other ships have professional rescue equipment.There are also gaps between China and the US in other technologies such as sea-probing  equipment and telecommunications.China mainly sent transporter planes,which lacked the necessary equipment to probe the ocean.While the United States sent P-3C and P-SA planes and MH60-R helicopters with equipment that can probe to depths of 76meters and cover 770sq kilometers in four hours.
China's technology clearly needs to be improved,After the plane lost contact on March 8,more than one satellite received signals from it,but there is no report of any of China's satellites receiving a signal.
Besides technology,China urgently needs to strengthen its international soft power,because almost all the important information was first obtained by Western media,which put pressure upon the Malaysian government for more timely and accurate information.Chinese media mainly forwarded the news broken by their Western colleagues.
Last but not least,more attention should be paid to international cooperation.The search and rescue efforts could well have been a race against time to save lives,but limited by international laws and the absence of cooperation mechanisms,China and some other countries involved did not fully share timely information.",high19937.txt
