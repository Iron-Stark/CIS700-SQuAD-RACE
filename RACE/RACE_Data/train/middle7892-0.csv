0,D,"[""The writer didn't like swimming at all."", ""The writer' s father bought a new truck this morning."", ""The writer's father lived in another town."", 'The writer had a good time with her father yesterday.']",Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?,"Yesterday, Dad and I made a big snowman. I was very cold, so Dad made some delicious soup and bread. When I got sleepy, Dad carried me to my bedroom and said, ""Good night, Pumpkin  .""
This morning, there was a truck   in front of our house. A truck is not a bad thing unless it' s carrying your dad's things to the other side of town.
""I'll see you tomorrow morning, Jzzie,"" Dad said, giving me a kiss,
I said ""bye"" and ran to my bedroom. I got a stomachache again. I' ve had lots of stomachaches since Mom and Dad told me about the divorce   because I can't get used to _ .
When Mom told me it was time for dinner, I told her. I was not leaving my room.
Mom led me downstairs anyway. Dad's chair was empty. We didn't talk. We didn't eat.
The phone rang.
""Hi, Izzie. My new apartment building has an indoor pool, so bring your swimsuit tomorrow, OK?""
""I don 't want to go swimming, Daddy. ""
""Well, think about it,"" he said. ""It could be fun.""
But I didn't want to have fun. In fact, I thought I would probably never have fun again.
I waited for him to say ""Good night, Pumpkin."" But all he said was ""See you tomorrow.""
When. I lay in bed, I found something under my pillow . It was an envelope. I opened it and pulled out a picture of a pumpkin. It was not even close to Halloween. I turned the picture over and saw the words  ""Good night"". I held the picture to my face and thought of Dad. Then I opened my top drawer, pulled out my favorite swimsuit and put it on my desk.
