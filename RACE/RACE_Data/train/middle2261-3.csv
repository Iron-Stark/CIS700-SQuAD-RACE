My name is Tony. I am English. I am twelve years old this year. I am tall, and I am good at playing football. I am in Grade Seven. There are thirty boys and twenty girls in my class. We are learning Chinese in our school. Our Chinese teacher is Mr. Wu. He is a little short, but he is very strong. He is very nice to us. I have some good friends in my class. Tom is a tall boy with short black hair. He is good at playing football, too. Alice is short and she loves wearing red dresses. She is good at English. Mary has long hair. She can speak Japanese and she likes swimming. We all study hard.
What about your school and your friends? Please write soon.
Yours,
