0,C,"['Because that day is quite close to the summer holiday.', ""Because the opening celebration won't be ready until that day."", 'Because the number SIX is considered to be ""lucky"" in China.', ""Because Shanghai Disneyland won't be completed until that day.""]","Why did the company decide to open on the date of ""June 16, 2016""?","DISNEY's theme park, its first on the Chinese mainland, Shanghai Disneyland, has already been completed, and will open its doors on June 16, 2016. ""Six is a lucky number to Chinese people,"" the Walt Disney Company said.
Shanghai Disneyland will host an opening celebration to welcome its first guests. At the opening, it will hold more Chinese-style activities instead of Western-style ones, because the host wants to show China's local traditional culture. ""We have prepared a three-day celebration and are hiring more than 8,000 actors,"" Philippe Gas, Shanghai Disneyland's general manager, told Shanghai Television yesterday.
So why has Disneyland been so popular? Well, it's described as ""the Happiest Place on Earth"" and ""a place for the young and young at heart"". Disney's storytelling in rides like roller coasters is a big reason for their parks' success. ""We tell a story in everything we do,"" Pressler said.
However, Disney's parks haven't always been popular everywhere. When Disneyland Paris opened in 1992, some French people felt that American culture was invading  France. But still, the park stayed open and today it is a popular place for European visitors.",middle7043.txt
