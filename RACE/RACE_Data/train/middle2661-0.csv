Her parents and friends couldn't understand why she chose the hard work. But facing all the confusion( ), Yang just smiled and said, ""Tibet is full of charm .""
When Yang finished her studies at the university three years ago, she had two choices: being an exchange student in Germany, or volunteering for Tibet. Finally, she chose the latter . Her father said, "" I'll support(  ) you. But no matter what happens, you have to face it on your own.""
