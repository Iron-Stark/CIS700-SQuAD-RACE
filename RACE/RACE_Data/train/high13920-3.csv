3,D,"['for the kings', 'for the people', 'for wars', 'for the gods']",The pyramids in ancient Mexico were built  _  .,"The kings of ancient Egypt planned strong tombs to keep their bodies safe after death and to hold their treasure.The Great Pyramids along the Nile are on its west bank.The ancient Egyptians compared the rising of the sun to the beginning of life and the setting of the sun to the end of life.This is why their dead bodies were buried on the west bank of the Nile.
The people of Mexico also built pyramids.They did not build the pyramids for tombs.They used to build a pyramid and then a temple on top of it.The pyramids of Mexico are not as high as the pyramids of Egypt,but they are bigger.Each of the pyramids has a wide stairway  that goes from the bottom to the top.
The biggest pyramid in Mexico is almost 2,000 years old.Scientists think it took 10,000 men more than ten years to build it.On the top they built a temple of the sun.The temple is no longer there,but people still call it the Pyramid of the Sun.Near it is another huge pyramid,the Pyramid of the Moon.",high13920.txt
