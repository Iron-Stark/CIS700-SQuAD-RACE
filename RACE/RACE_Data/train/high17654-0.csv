0,C,"['Poe is too busy to spare time for her family.', 'Poe decided to be a doctor when she was in Grade 5.', ""There are three doctors in Poe's family."", ""Poe's husband takes pride in her.""]",Which of the following statements is NOT true?,"As the only physician in a small local clinic and hospital, Katrina Poe sees dozens of patients on any given day. She's on call at the hospital in Kilmichael every day, and she gets little time with her sons, aged 3 and 3 months. But the country doctor doesn't complain about her job. It's the one she chose for herself 25 years ago while she was a fifth-grader in Kilmicahael.
The daughter of two workers in a town that had produced only two other doctors, Poe might not have been expected to go to college at all, let alone medical school. But it was a challenge at first, being the town's first female and first black doctor. She even had patients who refused to see her at first. But a lot of those patients who were unwilling in the beginning are now some of her most favorite patients and have accepted her, finally. Many patients, in fact, now refuse to seek health care elsewhere.
Though she's working at least 80 hours a week, Poe is sorry that she sometimes has to turn patients away. ""I just can't see everybody,"" she says. ""I'm seeing patients after hours, so it's just very busy."" 
In addition to her work at the hospital and clinic, Poe cares for all residents of the local nursing home and the local mental health facility during monthly visits. ""This town and the little hospital are fortunate to have her,"" says Calvin Johnson, Poe's husband. He says it is without a doubt ""the love and support of the people"" that make living in Kilmichael worthwhile for the family.
In recognition of her services to rural medicine, the Texas-based physician staffing firm Staff Care Inc. named Poe, 35, the ""2005 Country Doctor of the Year.""",high17654.txt
