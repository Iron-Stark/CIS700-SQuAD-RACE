I wasn't the jelly maker in this family. My mother-in-law was. She didn't provide a wide range of flavors  , either. It was either grape or blackberry. And since we liked both flavors, we usually picked whatever jar was at the front of the pantry  .
It was always there. Jelly making was just a way of life for her. She always did it, following the same habits ---from picking the fruit to setting the finished jelly on the homemade shelves.
This past December, my mother-in-law passed away. Among the things in the house to be divided up were the remaining canned   goods. Each of us chose from the many jars of tomato juice, green beans and jelly.
The other day I reached in there to get jelly for a quick sandwich, and there it was. Sitting all alone on the far side of the shelf was a small jar of grape jelly. Written on the lid with a black marker was ""GR"" for grape and the year the jelly had been made.
As I picked up the jar, I suddenly realized something that I had failed to see earlier. This was the last jar we would ever have from my mother-in-law's patient, loving hands. Our children had never known a day without their grandmother's jelly. It seems like such a small thing, but it was a great treasure.
Holding that last jar in my hand, my heart traveled back to meeting my mother-in-law for the first time. I saw her crying on our wedding   day, and later, kissing and loving our children. I saw her walking in the woods or riding the wagon  . I saw her surrounded by loving children at her funeral. 
I put the jelly back on the shelf. No longer was it just a jar of jelly. I guess I believed that as long as it was there, my mother-in-law would always live on.",middle4620.txt
