1,A,"['has two birth parents and their children', 'has two birth parents and only one child', 'is traditional but complicated', ""doesn't have any children""]","We can learn from the text that a ""nuclear"" family   _  .","""Reconstituted"" families are more and more common in the UK.
Steve and Debbie got married in 2001 and had two children,Lily and Alex.Unfortunately,Steve and Debbie's marriage didn't work out and they got divorced in 2006.The children live with Debbie.In 2008,Debbie remarried.Her new husband,Martin,has three children from his previous marriage and they visit Debbie,Martin,Lily and Alex at weekends.In addition,Debbie is pregnant with her third child.She's expecting a boy who will be a halfbrother to Lily and Alex and also to Martin's three other children.
Confused?Debbie's family arrangements might have seemed strange 30 years ago but nowadays this kind of ""reconstituted"" family is increasingly common in the UK.Almost half of all marriages in Britain end in divorce and over 40% of marriages are remarriages.More than 10% of all British children live with one birth parent and a stepparent--a parent who isn't their biological mother or father.The traditional ""nuclear"" family of two parents and their children is not so traditional any more.
What does all of this mean for parents in these ""reconstituted"" families?""There  are  difficulties  and  challenges,""  says Debbie.""Different families have different routines and it can be difficult for children to move between their two families.Birthdays and holidays can be tricky.Where do the children go?Who should they spend their time with?Also,when my children are naughty it can be difficult for Martin to _ .Things that might be simple in a traditional family can be a bit more complicated.""
And how about the children?Martin's eldest child,Ella,is 12.""I like my two families,"" she says.""I live with my  mum but visit my dad quite often and I'm happy that my mum and dad get along OK.They're not married any more but it's good that they can still be friends.""  Of course divorce and separation are never easy but many families in the UK are finding ways to make family life work in new ways.",high7555.txt
