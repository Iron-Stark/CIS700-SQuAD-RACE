They spend most of their time watching people around them. The yentas have this title for this. ""Yenta"" is a Yiddish word. It means a trouble maker or a talkative person. Nobody in the street is safe from their eyes or tongue.
Yentas certainly are not bad people. They pass on messages and advice. They give _ weather reports. They know who is doing what. They see,hear,and know all and usually repeat it. They have called themselves reporters.
