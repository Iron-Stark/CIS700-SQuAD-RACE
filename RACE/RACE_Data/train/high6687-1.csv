1,A,"['became more considerate in his job', 'regretted taking a ""gap year""', 'was eager to explore ancient buildings', 'Improved his speaking ability']","After his gap year, Dr. Sinar   _  .","Dennis Sinar, 51, a doctor from Washington, N. C., is quick to explain why he took a yearlong break from his job. ""I was pretty burned out after practicing medicine for 26 years. I needed a recharge."" So he took a ""gap year"", from July 2011 to June 2012, to explore things like ancient buildings, antique restoration, and traditional Eastern medicine, in locations including Alaska, Nepal and Romania.
""Taking a break from work is an excellent way for adults to go into a new career or refresh an old one,"" said Holly Bull, president of the Center for Interim Programs in Princeton, N, J., which sets up gap-year programs. The group works mainly with college-age students, but it has also served older adults since it was formed 28 years ago. ""In recent years, mid-career breaks have been gaining more interest,"" she said. A report on adult gap years published this year by a market research company also described the potential American market for gap years as a ""sleeping giant.""
""A gap year is a challenge for the older individual to step out of a comfort zone and take a risk. I enjoyed that side most."" said Dr. Sinar, who kept a daily blog about his experience. His time studying Eastern medicine ""reaffirmed the reasons I went into health care,"" said Dr. Sinar, who returned to practice medicine at his old job, although he works fewer days. ""I use those experiences to provide my patients with more care,"" he added. ""And I listen better than I did before.""
George Garritan, chairman of the Department of Leadership and Human Capital Management at New York University, certainly agrees with Dr. Sinar. He said a gap-year experience could be worthwhile for employees and companies. For employees, investing in themselves and improving skill sets is a move that will benefit throughout their career. He added that returning employees feel refreshed and have given more thought to their career. For companies, offering unpaid leaves makes good sense for attracting and keeping talented employees.
""My hope is that this takes off,"" Dr. Garritan said. ""We're all thinking, 'What's my next act?' """,high6687.txt
