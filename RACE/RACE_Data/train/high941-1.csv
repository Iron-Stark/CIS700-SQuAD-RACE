1,C,"['climate change', 'London Olympics in 2012', 'global warming', 'green environment']",The topic of the meeting in Seoul might be   _  .,"Mayor Boris Johnson Monday outlined plans to make London ""the cleanest"" by the 2012 Olympics and called for commitments from other world cities at a climate change conference. Leaders of the world's 40 largest cities are meeting in Seoul this week for a summit on _ global warming ---- the third to be held since 2005.
""What we should do in Seoul is agree that we will stop the endless addiction of mankind to the internal combustion engine  ,"" said Johnson. He told a press conference the world's cities consume 75 percent of its energy and produce 80 percent of the emissions which cause climate change. ""The problem of our planet is an urban problem,"" Johnson said.
He said the British capital wants to use the Olympics ""to drive the greening and the improvement of our city"" and noted that London is committed to reduce carbon emissions by 60 percent by 2025.
Johnson said the key measure was addressing the problems relating to domestic and commercial buildings, which accounted for 70 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in London. This involved retrofitting   ---- installing lagging   ---- in large numbers of public buildings.
Johnson proclaimed himself a ""passionate cyclist"" and said he would push ahead with cycle super-highways around London.
London's air quality problem, he said, was caused by vehicle emissions from 8,300 antiquated   diesel   buses, which could be replaced by low-carbon vehicles. There were also 32,000 taxis running on diesel fuel, which could be replaced by electric vehicles.
Johnson said there would be a substantial   program in the next few years to produce a ""cleaner, greener"" bus for his city. ""The age of the diesel-emitting bus has got to be over in London.""",high941.txt
