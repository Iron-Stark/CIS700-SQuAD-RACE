Aiden McDonald amazed the doctors who arrived at Jeanine McDonald's house 10 minutes after Aiden called 000. The boy was very calm and spoke to the doctors as his mother got into an unconscious state. 
Sacha Lewis took the strange call and sent out an ambulance immediately. Aiden answered questions during the 19-minute call that made it clear it was a serious matter.
Lewis said, ""He sounded worried and was telling me things like 'Mummy is not awake', so I got an idea that it was a fairly serious matter.""

 ""Mummy's not well.""
 ""How old are you, sweetheart?""
 ""I got a duck.""
 ""Can I talk to Mummy?""
 ""I can't get my Mummy.""
 ""Where is she?""
 ""On the floor. Mummy's had a faint ""
 ""Do you live in Kallangur?""
 ""We've got milk in the fridge and, urn, (pause) I can't find the ambulance (crying,) Mummy, Mum...Mum...Mum...""
