1,B,"['be calm and confident', ""react bravely and you're your confidence"", 'hang around and argue with them', 'stay with friends always']","To avoid bullies, you are advised to   _  .","What do Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson and Phil Collins all have in common? They were all bullied at school. 
If you're being bullied, it doesn't mean there is something wrong with you. You have a right to feel safe. If you are being bullied at school, it is the school's responsibility to stop it. If you are being attacked outside of school, the police have the responsibility to help you.
The bully is the one with the problem.
 A lot of bullies are already being bullied themselves. They feel powerless and so they look for ways to feel tough at school or in the street.
 Often, the bully is envious of other kids, so he picks on those who are cleverer, or those kids who have cool dress or more money. Usually bullies don't like themselves, so they take out their frustrations on someone else, e.g. you.
 What can you do?
  * Look calm and confident even when you are not! You can practice this in the bathroom mirror.
* If possible, ignore the bully. Bullies want a reaction --if you don't seem upset, or angry, they'll often leave you alone.
* Walk away. Just because a bully starts an argument doesn't mean you have to hang around and finish it.
  * Avoid being alone. Bullies are cowards who only pick a fight when they know they can win. If you are with friends, they are more likely to leave you alone.
 Get help!
 Tell an adult you can trust. This doesn't mean you are weak. In life you often need to get help from other people. When you have a broken leg, you get help from a doctor--it doesn't mean you are weak. If you are being bullied you also get help. Bullies want you to keep quiet. When you speak up, you refuse to play the bully's game. Telling others about the problem is a brave move.",high21740.txt
