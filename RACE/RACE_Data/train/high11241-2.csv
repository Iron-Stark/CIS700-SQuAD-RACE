Wash Your Hands
And wash them often, in hot soapy water, and for the amount of time it takes you to sing ""Happy Birthday"" twice.
Get Enough Sleep

Keep Hydrated
Drink enough water each day to clear poisonous matter from your system and keep up good moisture production in your body.
Eat Immune-Improving Foods
Keeping you body strong and ready to fight infection is important in flu prevention. Fatty foods can slow your metabolism , make you feel inactive, and weaken your immune
system. So stick with whole grains, colorful vegetables, and vitamin-rich fruits.
Avoid Alcohol

Proper exercise-for example walking for 30-40 minutes 3-4 times a week-supports the immune system by increasing circulation, oxygenating the body, removing poisonous material through sweat, and reducing tension and stress. So get moving!
Avoid Contact with Sick People
If you're coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth(and then wash your hands),and if you have to be around someone who is sick, try to stay a few feet away from them and avoid physical contact.
Know When to Get Help
A/H1N1 can look like regular flu, so don't feel like you necessarily are infected if you're exhibiting flu-like symptoms . But do go to your doctor if you live in an area where there are recorded cases, or if your symptoms are very serious.",high11241.txt
