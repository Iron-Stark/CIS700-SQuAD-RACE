2,B,"['Tourism industry in that state will welcome a boom.', 'The :best job in the world: winner will choose not to leave the island.', 'The tough economic climate in the state will be greatly eased.', 'The local people will persuade the successful candidate not to go home.']","According to Desley Boyle's prediction, what will happen when the 6-month contract is over?","SYDNEY--- An Australian state is offering internationally what it calls ""the best job in the world""---- earning a top salary for lazing around a beautiful tropical island for six months.
    The job pays 150,000 Australian dollars ($105,000) and includes free airfares from the winner's home country to Hamilton Island on the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland's state government announced on Tuesday.
    In return, the island caretaker will be expected to stroll the white sands, snorkel  the reef, take care of ""a few minor tasks""----- and report to a global audience via weekly blogs, photo dairies and video updates.
    The successful applicant, who will stay rent-free in a three-bedroom beach home complete with plunge pool and golf cart, must be a good swimmer, excellent communicator and be able to speak and write English.
    ""They also have to talk to media from time to time about what they are doing so they can't be too shy and they'll have to love the sea, the sun, the outdoors,"" said acting state Premier Paul Lucas.
    ""The fact that they will be paid to explore the islands of the Great Barrier Reef, swim, snorkel and generally live the Queensland lifestyle makes this undoubtedly the best job in the world. ""
    Lucas said that the campaign was part of a drive to protect the state's 18 billion Australian dollar a year tourism industry during th tough economic climate caused by the global financial meltdown.
    ""Traditional tourism advertising just doesn't cut it sometimes and we are thinking outside the box by launching this campaign.""
    Queensland Tourism Minister Desley Boyle said some people might question whether it was risky to let an unknown person become an unofficial tourism spokesperson for the state.
    ""I think the biggest risk will be that the successful candidate won't want to go home at the end of the six months,"" she said.
    ""This is a legal job which is open to anyone and everyone.""
    Applications are open until February 22, 2009. Eleven shortlisted candidates will be flown to Hamilton Island in early May for the final selection process and the six month contract will commence on July 1.",high20117.txt
