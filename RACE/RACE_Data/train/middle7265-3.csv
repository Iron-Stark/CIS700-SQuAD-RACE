3,A,"['a whole day', 'a quarter of a day', 'three hours', 'two days']",It took Mrs. Lincoln   _   to make a trip to the town.,"When Abraham Lincoln was just a boy, he had to help his father to look after their farm. It was hard work and there wasn't anything interesting for him. Abraham wanted to go to school, but there was no school there. He was sad most of the time.
Mrs. Lincoln loved the boy very much. She tried her best to make Abraham happy. One morning she got up early and went to the town. It was a long way, so it took her a long time to get there. She bought something there and went back. It was late in the evening when she got home.
The next morning Mrs. Lincoln said to Abraham,""Today is your birthday, so we're going to have a party.""She put some food on the table, and then brought out a present.
""A book!""Abraham cried. It was an old book, but he liked it. A smile came on his face. He looked up at Mrs. Lincoln and said,""Thank you, Mom.""",middle7265.txt
