Joe Heim: What misunderstandings are there of you?
Valerie Jarrett: A little-known fact is that I started my life very shy and remained very shy well into adulthood. Painfully shy, I would call it. And I often share this, particularly with young people, because it's something I really had to work hard to overcome. And for all the shy people out there I say, you, too, can overcome it. But it took a lot of hard work on my part, and I discovered along the way that just because you're nervous and you have butterflies in your stomach doesn't mean that it has to show. My point in sharing it with you is that part of life is pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone  . And if you're going to grow, you have to learn how to take on new challenges that you might not be good at.

Valerie Jarrett: I serve at the pleasure of the president. If he wants me to stay, I will.",high14411.txt
