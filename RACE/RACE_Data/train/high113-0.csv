0,C,"['is an effective way of punishment', 'does not make much sense in class', ""can improve pupils' confidence"", 'makes pupils more creative']","According to Dr. Helen Lees, ""enforced silence""   _","Encouraging pupils to keep noise to a minimum should be a valuable component of all children's education, according to new research.
Dr. Helen Lees, from Stirling University's school of education, says that ""enforced silence"" is seen as a punishment and often acts to _ children's natural ability. But she says that teaching children about the benefits of ""enforced silence"",--- deliberate stillness that gives them the opportunity to focus and reflect in a stress-free environment--- can have a significant effect on pupils' concentration and behavior.
It is the latest in a string of researches to establish a link between the classroom environment and pupils' academic ability.
A study almost a decade ago in London found that children's exam results were cut by as much as a third if they were taught in noisy classrooms. Teaching unions have also called for a limit of 26degC to be put on classroom temperatures because teachers and pupils struggle to work in hot conditions, and some educationalists claim that too much clutter on classroom walls can prevent children from concentrating.
Dr. Lees said, ""When we take some research on school settings and put it all together, what we see is that education without silence does not make much sense. In areas of better learning outcomes, better self- confidence and well-being measures, enforced silence in a person's life and an individual's education is shown throughout the relevant research to be a benefit.""
Dozens of schools across Britain have already introduced periods of ""reflective silence"" into the timetable.
Kevin Hogston, head of Sheringdale Primary, south London, has just introduced a minute's silence at the start of twice-weekly meetings in which children are taught breathing techniques and encouraged to reflect. The school plans to introduce it into classrooms every day.",high113.txt
