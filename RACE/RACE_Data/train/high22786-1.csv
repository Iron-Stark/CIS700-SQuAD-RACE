Amanda Keddie and Martin Mills
Bridges the gap between theory and practice to offer a practical and sustainable framework for teaching boys in classrooms of all levels.
Sales points
    Teaching boys remains one of the most concerned issues in education today.
Many books have been published analysing why boys perform less well than girls, and why some boys struggle at school. But they don't show teachers what will work: this book does.
The authors offer a research-based framework for classroom strategies that work with boys--and don't disadvantage girls.
Description
Boys' education continues to be a focus of public anxiety among teachers. Concern about boys' general educational under-achievement and the impact this under-achievement has on the boys themselves, as well as on the broader society, continues to fuel disagreement and debate on the best approach to take in response.
Teaching Boys provides a framework for developing practical and sustainable ways to improve boys' education. The book indicates how what teachers do in the classroom can enable boys' academic and social outcomes. With detailed case studies, Keddie & Mills outline a range of practical classroom strategies that will assist teachers to meet the challenge of teaching boys, without neglecting the girls in the process.
