2,D,"['Did You Know the Danger of Water', 'Be Responsible Parents', 'The Fast Running Mill Creek', 'Beginning Swimmer Saved Drowning Boy']",What would be the best title for the passage?,"An 18-year-old high school student who had just learned to swim in the last summer vacation saved the life of a drowning Ohio boy on Friday afternoon.
Tom Erickson was credited with (......)saving the life of Jason Pryor,10, in Mill Creek   Park. Young Jason Pryor, from Chillicothe, was visiting  s from Anchor Point when he fell into the Mill Creek.
The Pryor boy had no business playing nea k*s5&u r the edge of the river, but he had no idea of the danger.
The Creek, with much more water than usual for the recent spring rains, flowed fast and carried the boy around a bend and out of sight from his parents, who took Jason out there and said they had not even witnessed the incident.
Luckily for Jason, one of the most unselfish students from Brentwood's Central High School was taking a walk alone through the park.
As soon as he found the boy struggling in the water, Erickson jumped into the Creek and managed to pull the drowning boy out of the water. And it was reported that Erickson had never received any life-saving instruction before.
""I wasn't sure I could do it,"" Erickson said. ""I didn't know if I could swim through the river by myself, not to mention getting another person out with me.""
This incident should be a lesson to young children who do not know how to swim. Stay away from dangerous bodies of water.",high16978.txt
