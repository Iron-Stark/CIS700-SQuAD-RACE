2,B,"['Benjerman was sent back immediately after Atkins put up the notices.', 'Atkins and her friends made a great effort to look for Benierman.', 'The thief gave the dog back but kept the sports car.', 'The dog was back at 1 pm on a Friday.']",Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?,"A woman whose sports car was stolen with her dog in it put up notices all over the area that made it clear getting back her pet was more important than her car.
""Whoever did this can keep my car. Please let Benjerman come home,"" the notice said.
It is not known whether the thief showed any pity, but almost 30 hours after the 1 pm theft Friday, Kimberly Atkins of Dover and Benjerman, a 12-year-old black retriever  , were reunited after police located them in Barrington.
""He's hungry, he's dirty, but he's very happy to be home,"" Atkins said.
The car was found at about 5 pm Saturday off Route 125 in a swampy   area frequented by off-the-road cars and dirt bikes. However, the police couldn't control Benjerman, and they had to call Atkins to come and get him.
Atkins said the thief cared for Benjerman a little by providing him with some dry cat food. She believed Benjerman ended up drinking some muddy water in the area. She said they have been together for nearly 11 years after she took him back from a society shelter in Dallas, Texas.
Before Benjelman was found, Atkins and several friends put up notices all over the city and in Somersworth. They also contacted animal shelters,throughout southern New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
The notice stated there was a reward, and also that the dog needed medication. Any caller could remain anonymous  .
Atkins had parked the car outside a hardware store with the keys inside and gone in to rent a carpet cleaner. ""It was l0 minutes and I came out and my car was gone along with Benjerman in broad daylight,"" Atkins said. The car thief threw Atkins' wallet and other personal items out of the car before escaping from the scene.",high283.txt
