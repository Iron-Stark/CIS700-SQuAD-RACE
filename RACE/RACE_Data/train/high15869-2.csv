2,C,"['App Store will offer you great fun .', 'Many apps have been developed for the iPhone.', 'Most apps are very expensive.', 'Pandora , Facebook, MySpace and the New York Times are popular websites.']",. Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage ?,"The new iPhone 3G should please everyone . Its look and feel are only slightly improved, but a faster network loads Web pages more quickly , true GPS functionality allows it to easily find places nearby , and the new $199 price(down from $400) makes it an affordable luxury.
Before deciding whether to buy, however , make sure you can actually take advantage of the iPhone 3G's high-speed data network. 3G stands for third-generation , which in non-geek speak translates to Web pages and mail messages that, ideally, load about three times faster than on the original iPhone. Even better, 3G coverage enables you to make a phone call and surf the Web at the same time . That's great, if you live or work in a place where the 3G network of AT&T (the sole wireless carrier of the iPhone) is active. That's not so great in cities like New York where AT&T's cellular  coverage is awful. As one of my colleagues in New York City, who bought the original iPhone , commented , ""It's just a toy . You can't make phone calls on it, so I carry my Verizon phone with me all the time.""
The real fun begins when you tap on the icon called ""Apple Store"" and start browsing   the hundreds of add-on applications that have been developed just for the iPhone. You will find tons of games (I like JirboBreak , a free game inspired by the Atari classic Breakout ) and mobile version of popular websites like Pandora , Facebook , MySpace and the New York Times . Most apps will cost you , but the vast majority are $9.99 or less. The apps work on the old iPhone too, but you'll enjoy them a lot more on the iPhone 3G because many of the programs , including Yelp(local business reviews ), Whrrl (mobile social networking) and UrbanSpoon(restaurant reviews), use you exact location --- provided by the iPhone 3G's GPS chip --- to make recommendations. The apps also load much faster over the 3G network.",high15869.txt
