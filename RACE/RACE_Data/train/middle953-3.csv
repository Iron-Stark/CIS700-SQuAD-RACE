Whenever she took me out for shopping, I found she wouldn't take any notice of the shop assistants when they suggested that some dresses were popular. She would say, ""We're not interested in that. Haven't you got anything a little unusual?"" And then the assistants would bring out all the strange colours no one else would buy. And later she and I would argue because I wanted to be ordinary but my mother wanted to be unusual.

""Couldn't you please wear something else?"" I asked one day when she was dressing for Parents' Day in tight   trousers and a bright pink sweater.
""What't wrong with it!""
""It's just that I wish you'd wear something ordinary."" I said, ""People won't laugh at.""
She looked at me angrily, ""Are you ashamed of your mother? If you are, Mary, I feel sorry for you.""",middle953.txt
