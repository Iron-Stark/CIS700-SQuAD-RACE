3,B,"['Making friends with some lonely people will bring them warmth', 'Your friend should not make mistakes in face of you.', 'Mother told me what friend is.', 'You should care about your friend.']","According to the passage, which is WRONG?","It doesn't matter if you have one friend or 20, because there are only a few people in this world that can make you truly happy. For me, my family and my three best girlfriends mean everything to me.
Some days I didn't want to go to school because I felt so disappointed in myself but I don't regret a thing. It makes you stronger as a person, and if you are able to mend your friendships like I have done, then you can do anything.
My mom always told me, ""Stephanie, remember that a friend is a gift that you give to yourself. A friend will always be there for the good and the bad. A true friend will never make fun of you. If a friend is a piece of work, then he or she has never been a friend at all. A friend is the biggest gift to you.""
Everyone is going to make mistakes but please don't push them away, especially if it's someone you really care about. I know when I make mistake I beat myself up about it. I just wish someone would have reached out a hand to help me back up on my feet like my best friend did. If someone is new or doesn't have a friend, please reach out and befriend them because that small action could mean the world to them. Now that I'm older, I understand what my mom has been trying to tell me, and now I know that the friends that I choose will also be the kinds of friends that I would want to be surrounded by forever.",high1585.txt
