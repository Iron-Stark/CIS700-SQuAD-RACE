China's present plastic identity cards were introduced 17 years ago, and a similar system is used by many other countries. However, the information shown on a card differs from nation to nation. Most ID cards show the holder' s name, sex, date of birth and photograph, as well as the card' s expiry   date and number.
Germany,  France and Spain all use ID cards, but there are some developed nations who dislike the idea. The US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and Britain are among those with no national ID card. However, some of the countries have ID cards for particular uses. For example, Australia and the United States use a driving licence   to identify people.
Identity cards are introduced for a variety of reasons. Race, politics and religion were often at the heart of older ID systems. In recent years, though, ID cards have been linked to national information databases, which form the basis of how a government manages a country.
The US, Britain and some other countries are considering a national ID system as a way of preventing possible terrorist attacks.
