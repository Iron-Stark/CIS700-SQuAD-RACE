3,C,"['Great hopes make a great woman.', 'Time and tide wait for no man.', 'Life wonders can really take place.', 'Misfortune will tell what fortune is.']",What can we learn from Thompson's story?,"After nearly 50 years of separation,an elderly woman has been reunited with the family that she feared was lost to her forever.
Celestine Thompson left Mississippi when she was 14 years old and eventually settled in New York,where she spent more than 30 years of her life,according to WLOX 13News. After surviving a fire in 1992,Thompson was in a coma for two years and has since experienced memory loss. The 90-year-old found it difficult to recall details about her family.
But later she remembered the name of her nephew Clarence Woodway. Then another woman who knows Thompson in Mississippi was able to track Woodway down and help reunite Thompson with her large family.
""In our minds,my brother and I were talking that she wasn't here anymore,because we hadn't heard from her for a very long time,""Donald Davis,another one of Thompson's nephews,told the media.""You know,we were overjoyed when we found out that we had gotten in contact with her.""
A few of Thompson's relatives visited her in New York,and then arranged a larger reunion which was held this past Saturday in Gulfport,Mississippi,the Associated Press reported.
Thompson now lives in Greensboro,Alabama,with a caretaker,and,although she is yet to meet them all,she has regained quite a sizeable family of 23 nieces and nephews,64 grand nieces and nephews,66 great-grand nieces and nephews and 34 great-great-grand nieces and nephews,according to the Associated Press.",high10412.txt
