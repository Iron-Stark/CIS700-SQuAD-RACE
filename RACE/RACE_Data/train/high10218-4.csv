4,A,"['The robot can help people change their lifestyle habits.', ""The robot can't speak English except Cantonese and Mandarin."", 'The robot that can speak many languages has been popular with the users.', 'The robot that can speak many languages meets the demand of the customers.']",What can we infer from the passage?,"Ask anyone what is the most difficult part of changing their lifestyle habits and they are most likely to say, ""Staying motivated."" But a 36-year-old professor from Carnegie Mellon University claims it may have the answer in the form of robot weight loss coach that dishes out daily health advice and encouragement.
Autom is the work of Intuitive Automata, a company based in Sha Tin which claims to be a pioneer in commercial socially-interactive robots.
The robot, which stands around 38 centimeters tall, has a head that swivels  , blue eyes, and a touch screen which allows the user to input information daily about exercise and diet Its creators say Autom will have a daily conversation with its user lasting up to five minutes, giving feedback and encouragement.Over time, it will interact more with the user as it gathers more information about them.
Cory Krdd, a research team manager with the Federal Emergency Management Agency claims research has shown that people find robots a more reliable source of information than on-screen-based character.
In a controlled study in Pittsburgh City Council, 15 dieters were given Autom for six weeks. Another 15 received a touch-screen computer with identical software and 15 were given a paper log.The study found, people using the robot are more likely to stick with their diets longer, in fact twice as long as those using just a paper log.
""While not one person among the computer or paper groups continued past six weeks, most who had Autom did not want to give her back at the conclusion of the study,"" he said.
The bottom line is that a robot creates a more powerful and long-lasting relationship with the user than a character on the screen.
Autom is expected to go on sale later this year in the United States for around $500.A robot which speaks and understands Cantonese and Mandarin in addition to English according to the demands is also being developed.",high10218.txt
