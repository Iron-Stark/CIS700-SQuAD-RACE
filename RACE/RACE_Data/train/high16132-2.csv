2,B,"['International Development Brings in Climate Change', 'Global Warming Is a Bigger Threat to the Poor', 'International Groups Work Together to Reduce Poverty', 'Worldwide Poverty Shall Be Avoided']",What is the best title of the passage?,"Global warming threatens to hold back human progress, and make unachievable all UN targets to reduce poverty, according to some of the world's leading international development groups.
In a report published today, Oxfam, Greenpeace, Christian Aid, Friends of the Earth, WWF and 15 other groups say rich governments must immediately address climate change to avoid even ""unbearable levels"" of worldwide poverty.
""Food production, water supplies, public health and people's living environment are already being damaged,"" the report says. ""The world must meet its promise to achieve poverty reduction and also deal with climate change.""
The report, which draws on UN predictions of the effects of climate change in poor countries over the next 50 years, says poor countries will experience more flooding, declining food production, more disease and the worsening or disappearing of entire ecosystems on which many of the world's poorest people depend.
""Climate change needs to be addressed now. The poor will bear the burden of it. The frontline experience of many of us working in international development indicates that communities are having to fight against more extreme weather conditions.""
Climate change will play havoc   with agriculture and water supplies and will increase diseases. ""By 2025 the proportion of the world's population living in countries of great water stress will almost double, to 6 billion people. Tropical and sub-tropical areas will be hardest hit -- those countries already suffering from food shortage"".
Poor countries mostly do not need high-tech solutions, but would most benefit from education, research and being shown how to farm better. The report says unchecked global warming, more than wars or political confusion, will displace millions of people and destabilize   many countries.",high16132.txt
