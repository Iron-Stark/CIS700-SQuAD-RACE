3,B,"['About 70 kilos', 'About 42 kilos.', 'About 32 kilos', 'About 30 kilos']",How much ground coffee will be used to cover a distance of 126 miles in this car?,"A car that runs on coffee is unveiled(shown to the public for the first time)today but at between 25 and 50 times the cost of running a car on petrol, the invention won't please any motor industry accountants.
Nicknamed the Car-puccino, it has been created using a 1988 Volkswagen Scirocco bought for PS400 and it was chosen because it looked like the time-traveling DeLorean in the movieBack To The Future.The car will be driven the 210 miles between Manchester and London powered only by roasted coffee granules  .It has been built by a team from the BBC1 science programme Bang Goes The Theory and will go on display at the Big Bang science fair in Manchester to show how fuels other than traditional petrol can power vehicles.
The team calculates the Car-puccino will do three miles per kilo of ground coffee   -- about 56 cups of espressos   per mile.The journey will use about 70 kilos of ground coffee which, at supermarket prices of between PS13 and PS26 a kilo depending on brand and quality, will cost between PS910 and PS1,820, or between 25 and 50 times the PS36 cost of petrol for the journey.In total, the trip will cost 11,760 espressos, and the team will have to take 'coffee breaks' roughly every 30 to 45 miles to pour in more granules.They will also have to stop about every 60 miles to clean out the 'coffee filters' to rid them of the soot and tar which is also generated by the process.So despite a top speed of 60mph, the many stops mean the going will be slow, with the journey taking around ten hours.
Sadly, the inventors will still have to pay duty on their coffee fuel---even though tax collectors at Her Majesty's Revenue and Custom haven't yet worked out how much.
Nick Watson, producer of Bang Goes The Theory, said, ""Coffee, like wood or coal, has some carbon content so you can use it as a fuel.The coffee needs to be very dry and in granules to allow the air to move through the pile of coffee as it burns.The brand doesn't matter."" He said the same technology could be used to power a car on other unusual fuels, such as woodchips or nut shells, construction or agricultural waste.",high11273.txt
