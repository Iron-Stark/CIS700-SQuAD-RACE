0,A,"['Four', 'Five', 'Six', 'Seven']",How many pieces of advice does the passage give us?   _,"If you think you're too shy and want to be a little brave, try the followings:
You can make it. Tell people you're shy. There's no need to hide it. When they get to know you're a shy kid, they'll understand you better. This also helps you feel more _ in talks.
Try to smile more. When you smile, people think you are friendly and easy to talk. Remember that other people have feelings, too; and most people will stay away from an angry-looking face.
Learn to be a good talker. If you find it hard to start talks, say something nice about people around you. Think about how great you feel when someone says something nice to you. Doesn't it make you want to keep talking to that person?
Get your attention elsewhere. Think more about ways to enjoy parties and games. Don't waste time, say to yourself ""You did it"". Keep trying and one day you'll never feel ""shy"" when you talk about yourself",middle7823.txt
