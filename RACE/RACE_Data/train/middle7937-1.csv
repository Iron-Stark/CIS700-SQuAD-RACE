1,D,"['excited', 'surprised', 'thankful', 'lucky']",Suzanne felt  _   to take part in the project 'World Class'.,"Dear Estelle,                                                 Saturday, 5th June
I hope you' re well and not working too hard! I' ve been revising for my exams now for the last two weeks. That' s why I haven' t written for such a long time.
Since the beginning of this year we' ve been doing a project called ' World Class'. Have you heard of it.'? Not everyone in the class could take part, but luckily I could. The school chooses a 'twin school'   in a different area of the world. Our head teacher chose a school in Uganda. They gave us someone to write to from that school. For three months, I've written to a girl called Louisa, who is the same age as me.
It' s been more interesting to hear about her life. She' s told me all about her school and described her daily   life. I can' t believe that her School doesn' t. have any electricity. She goes to 'school from eight o' clock in the morning until six. O'clock. in the evening. I can' t believe how lucky we are here! She' s also told me that she often can' t go to school because she has to look after her baby brother and sister. She's tried to teach me some of her language and it' s really difficult.
I love it because it' s the first time I' ve thought about what life must be like somewhere else. I can' t believe people miss classes here when everything is so easy for us. I think more people should help out with projects like this. At the weekend we' re going to have a sports day to help raise money to send to the school. Perhaps one day I'll be able to go to Uganda and meet Louisa myself--who knows?
Lots of 1ove,
Suzanne",middle7937.txt
