3,D,"['he was ill', 'he was very excited', 'he became very poor', 'he felt cold and hungry']",The reason why the man was trembling was that   _   .,"Keving Rogers used to be my boss.At that time he always told us to sell more.As soon as I could,I left his shop and got a new job in another place.The last time I saw Rogers was more than ten years ago.At least that's what I thought.But now I am not so sure.
I was on my way to my office in the centre of town.There is a small park nearby,which I sometimes walk through after lunch.The park was almost empty except for a shabby-looking man on one of those benches .The man looked about fifty years old and was wearing an old gray coat.It was cold and windy,and he was trembling .
""It's a long time since I had a meal.Can you help me?""he said.There was something about his voice that sounded familiar.I gave him a few pennies.As he went past me I looked at his face closely.I wondered where I had seen him before.Then it suddenly came to me.Could it possibly be...? No!Impossible,I thought.I watched him walking away.He was the same height as Rogers but looked a lot thinner than I remembered.
Yesterday I ran into someone who had worked for Rogers at the same time as I did,and had stayed on longer.I started telling him about the man I had seen in the park.""For a moment I thought it was our old boss.But it couldn't have been.Rogers must be the head of a company now.""I said.
My ex-workmate shook his head,""I thought you knew."" ""Knew?Knew what?What are you talking about?""
""Rogers was sent to prison six years ago.He's probably been out by now.For all I know he is sleeping on park benches and begging money from passers-by.""",high15532.txt
