0,D,"['It was quite expensive.', 'It was made especially for Eric.', 'It was a prize for his good behavior.', 'It helped to organize his life.']",What do we know about Eric's watch?,"Time never had any importance to me until I received a watch from my father that organized my life and made me more responsible.
I received this gift on a gray-sky day. I had to go to the airport at 9:00 a.m. to pick up my uncle Ali and take him to my father's house. However, I was late because I was hanging out with my friends. Later that day, around 11:00 a.m., I remembered my uncle, but I was very late. He had already left the airport and taken a taxi to my father's house.
I got to my father's house at 2:00 p.m. on the same day and looked at my angry father's face. I felt ashamed. After I said hi to my angry father and tired uncle, my father asked me to sit next to him and handed me this watch as a gift. Then he asked, ""Eric, did you have fun with your friends today?"" I answered, ""Yes, father, and I am sorry about not picking up my uncle."" He said, ""What you did was not very nice and you should be sorry for your actions."" I was ashamed. ""Father, I'll never do it again. I promise."" Then he replied, ""I hope today you learned something important, and this watch will be a reminder for you."" He told me to take this watch and use it as an organizer of my life.
I learned a very important lesson from my father that day: to respect time and never be late to meet someone. This watch is important to me, not because of its price, but because of the lesson that I learned from it.",high13954.txt
