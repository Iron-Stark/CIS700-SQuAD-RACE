1,D,"['full of fun but time-consuming', 'widespread but unnecessary', 'quick but difficult to do', 'common, used and cheap']",The writer believes that instant messaging is  _  .,"I credit my typing skill to so many hours of chatting online. Unfortunately, as my typing speed increased on the Internet, all grammatical rules _ You see instant messages have their own shorthand language and grammar isn't important, of which even a newbie   is aware. They can leave out articles, subjects  , pronouns, etc. They can misspell or ""respell"" almost any word. They often ask ""A/S/L"" when they first chat. Abbreviations   and capitalizations   are particularly important. English-speaking instant messengers also refuse to burden themselves with punctuation and capitalization.
After I came back China, I discovered not one but two instant messaging crazes. The first, which brought back memories of my previous addiction to the computer, was QQ. I can see evidence that the Chinese have the same kind of separate instant messaging language, even when they chat in English. My first word in this language, for example, was ""ft"". This abbreviation for ""faint"" is used whenever there is a need to express surprise. I also discovered that Chinese use the same kind of abbreviation for a laugh. And there is an extraordinary number of smileys   to the ""vomit"" and ""army soldier"" smileys. There is even a SARA smiley.
After QQ, there is another, perhaps more widespread messaging trend. You guessed it --- cell phone text messaging. I now understand how useful text messaging is and why it is so common. I admit that I have been guilty of sending text messages while walking outside or sitting on the subway. Who hasn't ? No matter where I go, I see people on their cell phones, messaging. In fact, it's rare to see someone actually talking on their phone!
So it looks as if there is no escape from the instant messaging crazes, no matter where in the world I go. And that's plainly not going to change. In the end, though, I can't complain: instant messaging is quick, it's cheap, it's easy and it's extremely fun too. And after all, everyone's doing it.",high570.txt
