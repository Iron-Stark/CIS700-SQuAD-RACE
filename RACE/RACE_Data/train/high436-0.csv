""No air conditioning? How can you sleep?"" a friend asks, horrified. I tell her my family has decided to shut the air conditioner off and reduce our electric bill. On this first night of our cost-cutting plan, it's only 85 degrees. We're going to suffer, but the three kids complain anyway.
They have grown up in 72-degree comfort, protected from the world outside.
""It's too hot to sleep,"" my 13-year-old daughter complains. ""I'm about to die from this heat,"" her brother complains down the hall. ""Just try it tonight,"" I tell them. In truth I'm too tired to turn for long. My face is sweaty, but I lie quietly listening to the cricket choirs outside that remind me of childhood.
The neighbor's dog howls. Probably a passing squirrel. It's been years since I took the time to really listen to the night.
I think about grandma, who lived to 92 and still helped with my mom's gardening until just a few weeks before she died. And then, I'm back there at her house in the summer heat of my childhood. I move my pillow to the foot of grandma's bed and turn my face toward the open window. I turn the pillow, hunting for the cooler side.
Grandma saw me turn over and over. ""If you just watch for the breeze ,"" she said, ""you'll cool off and fall asleep."" I stare at the filmy white curtain, willing it to move. Lying still, waiting, I suddenly notice the life outside the window. The bug chorus. Neighbors, porch -sitting late, speak in unclear words that calm me.
""Mom, did you hear that?"" my seven-year-old son cries, ""I think it was an owl family.""
""Probably,"" I tell him, ""just keep listening...""
Without the working air conditioner, the house is peaceful, and the natural night noises seem close enough to touch. I hope I'm awake tonight when the first breeze comes in.",high436.txt
