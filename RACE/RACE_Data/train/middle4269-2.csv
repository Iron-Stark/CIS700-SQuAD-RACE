2,B,"['the writer never helped her', 'the writer helped her all the time', 'the writer always felt guilty herself', 'the writer lost touch with her since they met']","According to Judy's words, we can learn that  _  .","I can still remember the day I met my best friend Judy. She had just moved into the neighborhood and her grandmother brought her down to meet me. I hid behind my mother and she hid behind her grandmother,scared to look at each other. Soon we lost the shyness and started playing with each other.
In the 7th grade ,I first lost touch with her. She was going through family problems and I _ her to be with the cooler people. None of my new friends liked her as much as I did because they knew she had problems. However, every summer we would always sit at each other's house, watch soap operas and talk about all the boys we like.
It was last year when I noticed the problem. I guess I was too doveted in high school to realizeshe needed someone there. Anyway ,she made a new best friend and so did I. Then I didn't know why, but she started cutting herself!
She then was diagnosed with clinical depression .At first, I was very upset, but we still stayed in touch. I wanted to be there with new her best friend basically deserted her and people were calling her crazy.
Yesterday she came to me and said,""I never knew what a best friend was until you, the only person, would stop me cutting. I appreciate your help so much, and you didn't even know you were helping me.""
We both cried. And I guess a kind of lesson from my life so far is never to give up on your friends. Even if they aren't as cool as others, or people think they are crazy, they need someone there. If you desert them, you will only be guilty yourself.",middle4269.txt
