It became an accepted name for fake goods   after ""Shanzhai Cellphones"" produced by small workshops in southern China became popular in the mainland market over the past two years.
Besides ""Shanzhai"" electronic products, there are ""Shanzhai"" movies, ""Shanzhai"" stars and even a ""Shanzhai"" Spring Festival Gala , a copy of the 25-year-old traditional show presented by CCTV on Chinese Lunar New Year's Eve.
 ""Shanzhai"" has become a culture of its own, standing foranything that _ something famous,which has caused a public debate over whether it is healthy or sick being a copycat.
In southwestern China's Chongqing, a ""Shanzhai""-version ""Bird's Nest"" built by farmers with bamboo attracts wide attention and the ""Shanzhai""-version ""Water Cube"" is popular with tourists. Both are copies of the famous Olympics places in Beijing.

  Tian said different kinds of cultures developing together are an ideal situation and they are for the public to choose.",high21035.txt
