2,D,"['Spending time chatting and playing cards.', 'Often asking some friends to drink together.', 'Playing computer games all day.', ""Never leaving today's work for tomorrow.""]",Which of the following is a good habit of saving time?,"A proverb   says ""Time is money."" But in my opinion  , time is even more precious   than money. Why? Because when money is spent, we can earn it back. However, when time is gone, it will never return. This is the reason why we must value time.
The time we can use is limited  . Therefore, even an hour is extremely  precious. We should  _ our time to do useful things. As students we must put more efforts into our lessons so as to serve society and our nation in the future.
But it is a pity that there are a lot of people who do not know the importance of time. They spend their precious time smoking, drinking and chatting. They do not realize that wasting time is equal , we should form the good habit of saving time. Do not put off   what can be done today until tomorrow.",high22179.txt
