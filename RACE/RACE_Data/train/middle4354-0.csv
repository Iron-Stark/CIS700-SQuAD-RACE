0,C,"['one and a half', 'two', 'three', 'six']",Peter is in school for   _   years.,"Little Peter is a boy of nine. He began to go to school when he was six, and now he is in Grade Three. He lives not far from the school, but he is often late for class. He likes watching TV in the evening and goes to bed late, so he can't get up on time in the morning.
This term, Mrs. Black, Peter's aunt, teaches music in Peter's school. She is strict with Peter and often tells the boy to obey the school rules and come to school on time. Yesterday morning, Peter got up late. When he hurried  to school, it was a quarter past eight. His aunt was waiting for him at the school gate.
""You are ten minutes late for the first class, Peter,"" Mrs. Black said angrily. ""Why are you often late for class?"" ""Every time, when I get to the street corner , I always see a guidepost . It says SCHOOL--GO SLOWLY!""",middle4354.txt
