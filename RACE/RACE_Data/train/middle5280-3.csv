3,C,"['Never grow up!', 'Believe your parents forever.', 'Are parents always the best teachers?', 'How many teachers can we have in our lives?']",What is the best title of the passage?,"Parents can be very important teachers in our lives. However, they are not always the best teachers. Parents may be too close to their children emotionally  . Sometimes they can only see their children through the eyes of a protector. For example, a teacher might see a trip to a big city as a valuable experience. However, it might seem too dangerous to a parent.
Another problem is that parents may expect their children's interests to be similar to their own. If they love science, they may try to force   their child to love science too. But what if (......) their child's true love is art, or writing, or car repair?
Parents usually want to _ their values to their children. But should children always believe what their parents do? When children are young, they believe that their parents are always right. But when they get older, they will have different ways of thinking.
The most important thing to realize is that we all have many teachers in our lives. Our parents teach us, our teachers teach us, and our friends teach us. Books and newspapers and televisions also teach us. All of them are valuable.",middle5280.txt
