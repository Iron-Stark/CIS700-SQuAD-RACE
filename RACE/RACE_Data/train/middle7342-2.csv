2,B,"['get less homework to do every day', 'find a way of giving doughnuts to Keith', 'celebrate the victory in the bakery', 'tell Keith not to eat too many doughnuts']",Danny most probably planned to   _   when he lay wide-awake on the bed.,"Danny lived for football. He played it, watched it, talked and dreamed about it. His favourite football star was Keith Connolly - Lowgate's captain.
One day in January, after school, Danny hurried through his homework. He wanted to watch TV. Keith Connolly was doing an interview on the local news programme.
Danny hoped that the television wouldn't go fuzzy*or lose the sound when Keith
Connolly was talking. It was an old set, and it did things like that.
It wasn't clear enough, but at last Keith Connolly's smiling face appeared on the screen.
""What I really like about playing for Lowgate,"" he said, ""is the fans. They're the best. They always support us. It's wonderful running on to the playground to all that cheering and chanting.""
Danny wished he could be in that crowd at the Lowgate ground, but the price of a single ticket was far above anything he could afford. There was no chance of the whole family going, or even just Danny and his little brother.
""You won again on Saturday,"" said the reporter. ""Did the team go out to celebrate?""
""We went for a meal together,"" said Keith Connolly, ""but I have to be careful about what I eat, because I want to stay fit. I love doughnuts* very much ...""
Then the sound went fuzzy, and Danny jumped up and _ the top of the set heavily to make it come on again. He hadn't missed much. But he had missed something important.
Keith Connolly had been saying ""... but I'm not allowed to eat doughnuts.""
Danny hadn't heard that. All he heard was that Keith Connolly loved doughnuts. And at the end of Danny's street was a bakery*. It sold the biggest and the best doughnuts!
When Danny went to bed, he lay wide-awake, making a plan.",middle7342.txt
