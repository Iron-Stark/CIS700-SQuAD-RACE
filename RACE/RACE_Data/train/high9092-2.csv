2,B,"['help them learn better', 'reduce their reading difficulties', 'build up their bodies', 'improve their learning concentration']",The program helps the students in the following ways except  _  .,"Sitting at a desk in a classroom all day can be pretty boring.
The teachers at Ward Elementary in Winston -Salem,North Carolina ,picked up on that and traded in their students' desks for exercise bikes as a part of their Read and Ride program!
The Read and Ride program began five years ago.One classroom has enough bikes for every student in any given class,and throughout the day teachers bring in their students to the room to ride them and read their books.
Even regular classrooms have one bike in the back of each room for students who just can't sit still to use to help them burn energy in a good way.
Students love being more active! Teachers enjoy seeing students eager to read.Parents appreciate stronger,smarter children.Headmasters value this effective and cost-free program.""Riding exercise bikes makes reading fun for many kids who get frustrated when they read.Thus,they have a way to release that frustration while they ride,""said Scott Ertl,who started the program.""As we can see,everyone wants to promote literacy and lose weight! But many students who are overweight struggle with sports and activities since they don't want to always be the last or lose with others watching on the playground.On exercise bikes,however,students are able to exert themselves at their own level--without anyone noticing when they slow down or take a break.""
As it turns out,not only are the bikes helping the students burn calories,they're also helping them learn better and stay focused.At the end of the school year the school analyzed testing data and found that students that spent more time reading and riding did more than twice as well on reading tests than their fellow students who spent the least time in the program.",high9092.txt
