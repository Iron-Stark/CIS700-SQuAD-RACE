How can he or she get the homework done as quickly as possible ? ""Here are some tips :
1.If the child is as young as nine or ten ,ask him or her to prepare a small notebook to write down the homework given by his or her teachers .By developing this habit ,he or she will learn to be much more responsible  .
2.Find a good place to study .This should be a quiet place that is free from everything but study things .No games ,radios ,or televisions .Once you have decided on a place to study ,this should be the only place where your child does his or her homework and studies .There should also be a very specific time for homework to be done .Usually ,homework should be done as soon as the child gets home from school .This also goes for the kids who take part in afterschool activities .Of course ,it is a good idea to allow the child to have a healthy snack before the work begins .
3.Also remember that it is the child's duty to do his or her homework .Some children give up easily and go to Mom and Dad for help when they have a problem .Try to let them solve it first .By doing this ,they will get a sense of success from  overcoming  problems .In this way we help them to help themselves .",middle5828.txt
