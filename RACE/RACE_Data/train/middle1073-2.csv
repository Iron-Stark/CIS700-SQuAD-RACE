2,C,"[""The Sun's Energy"", 'Plants', 'Food Chains', 'Living Things']",Which of the following would be the best title for this passage?,"All living things on the earth need other living things to live. Nothing lives alone. Most animals must live in a group, and even a plant grows close together with others of the same kind. Sometimes one living thing kills another, one eats and the other is eaten. Each kind of life eats another kind of life in order to live, and together they create a food chain  . Some food chains are simple, while others are not. But all food chains begin with the sun, and all food chains become broken up if one of the links   disappears.
All life needs sunlight to live on. But only plants can use sunlight directly. Plants are 'factories'. They make food from sunlight, water and things in the soil   and air. Plants feed all other living things. Animals can only use the sun's energy after it has been changed into food by plants. Some animals feed directly on plants, others eat smaller animals. Meat-eating animals are only eating plants indirectly.
What about humans? We are members of many food chains. We eat rice, vegetables, and fruits and so on. We also eat meat and drink milk. But we often break up the food chains. We kill wild animals and also make rivers, lakes and seas polluted. When these rivers, lakes and seas are polluted, the fish in them can not be eaten. If we eat the fish, we will get strange illnesses.
Each form of life is linked   to all others. Breaking the links puts all life in danger.",middle1073.txt
