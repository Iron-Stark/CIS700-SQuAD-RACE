2,C,"['the most important guest', 'both the host and the hostess', 'the host or the least important person', 'the host himself']","When some guests are in a Japanese home,   _  should sit nearest to the entrance.","Many Western people are not used to sitting on the floor any more. In Japan, however, sitting upright on the floor is common in different situations. For example, meals are traditionally had when people sit on the tatami   floor around a low table. Also during the tea ceremony and other traditional events, one sits on the floor.
The formal way of sitting for both men and women is kneeling upright. People who are not used to sitting in this style may feel uncomfortable after a few minutes, and their legs may go numb. However, foreigners are not usually expected to be able to sit in this style for a long time, and an increasing number of Japanese people themselves aren't able to do so, owing to a more westernized lifestyle.
In other situations, men usually sit cross-legged, while women sit on their knees laying both legs to one side. The former sitting style is considered wholly male, while the latter is considered completely female.
The most important guest sits on the honored seat which is set farthest from the entrance. If there is a tokonoma   in the room, the guest should be seated in front of it. The host or the least important person is supposed to sit next to the entrance. Of course, there are other things to be considered in each particular case.",high13056.txt
