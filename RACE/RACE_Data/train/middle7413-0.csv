0,B,"['in seven day', 'in the evening', 'in the office', ""at Mr Brown's house""]",A small party will be held   _  .,"Mr Jones and Mr Brown worked in the same office. One day Mr Jones said to Mr Brown ""We are going to have a small party at our house next Wednesday evening. Would you and your wife like to join us?""
Mr Brown said, ""Thank you very much. That is very kind of you. We are free that evening,I think. But I will telephone my wife and ask her. Maybe   she wants to go somewhere else that evening."" So Mr. Brown went to the other room and telephoned. When he came back,he looked very uneasy  .
""What's the matter?"" said Mr Jones. ""Did you speak to your wife?"" ""No,"" answered Mr Brown, ""She wasn't there. My small son answered the telephone. I said to him, 'Is your mother there,David?' and he answered, 'No,she is not in the house!' 'Where is she then?' I asked. 'She is somewhere outside!' 'What is she doing?' 'She is looking for me.'""",middle7413.txt
