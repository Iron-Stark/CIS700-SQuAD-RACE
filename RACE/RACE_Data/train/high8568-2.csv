2,D,"['This was the first time she gave a speech to graduates.', 'She complained about her school life in her speech.', 'She is a graduate of Tennessee State University.', 'She is enthusiastic about public service.']",What do we know about Mrs. Obama from the text?,"Mrs. Obama spoke to the graduates of Martin Luther King Jr. High School on Saturday in her only high school commencement speech this year. The ceremony took place in the gymnasium of Tennessee State University.
The first lady told the 170 graduates that she spent too much of her time in college focusing on academe achievements. While her success in college and law school led to a good job, she said, she ended up focusing on public service. ""My message to you today is that don't waste a minute living someone else's dream,"" she said. ""It takes a lot of real work to discover what brings you joy and you won't find what you love simply by checking mailboxes or surfing the net.""
She said MLK reminded her of her own high school experience in Chicago. ""My No.1 goal was to go to a high school that would push me and challenge me,"" she said. ""I wanted to go somewhere that would celebrate achievement. Unfortunately, schools like this don't exist for every kid."" she said. ""You are blessed.""
The first lady told graduates that failure may be a part of their college lives and careers, and that how they respond determines what they will become. ""That's when you find out what you're really made of in those hard times,"" she said. ""But you can only do that if you're willing to put yourself in a position where you might fail."" Overcoming difficulties has been the mark of many great people, she said, ""Oprah was demoted from her first job as a news reporter, and now she doesn't even need a last name,"" she said of media giant Oprah Winfrey ""And then there's this guy Barack Obama, I could take up a whole afternoon talking about his failures. He lost his first race for Congress"", the first lady joked, ""and now he gets to call himself my husband.""",high8568.txt
