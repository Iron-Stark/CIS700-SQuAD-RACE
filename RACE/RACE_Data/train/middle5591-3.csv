3,D,"['Good morning', 'Happy New Year', 'Best Wishes to you', 'Merry Christmas']","On the morning of Christmas Day, children say '  _  ' to their parents.","On Christmas Eve, the night before Christmas Day, children are very happy. They put their stockings  at the end of their beds before they go to bed. They want Father Christmas to give some presents. Father Christmas is a very kind man. He comes on Christmas Eve. He lands on top of each house and comes down the chimney  into the fireplace and brings children a lot of presents.
Christmas Day always begins before breakfast. Children wake up very early. They can't wait to open the presents in their stockings. Then they wake up their parents and shout 'Merry Christmas!'
Do you know what Christmas means? Christmas Day is the birthday of Jesus Christ. When Christ was born, many people gave him presents. So today, people still do the same thing to children.",middle5591.txt
