2,D,"['Better safe than sorry', 'Traps can always cause chain reactions', 'To keep the balance of nature is the duty of us all', 'What you think impossible to happen to you might come at you unexpectedly']",What can we learn from the story?,"A mouse looked through a crack  in the wall to see the farmer and his wife opening a package; what food might it contain? He was astonished to discover that it was a mouse trap!
Running to the farmyard, the mouse shouted, warning everyone, ""There is a mouse trap in the house, there is a mouse trap in the house.""
The chicken, with her head high, glared at the mouse and said, ""Shut up. Little Ugly. This is a great concern to you, but it has nothing to do with me; I can't be troubled by it.
The mouse turned to the pig and told him, ""There is a mouse trap in the house."" ""I am so sorry, Mr. Mouse,"" said the pig sympathetically, ""but there is nothing I can do about it but pray; you are always in my prayers.""
The mouse turned to the cow, who relied, "" A mouse trap, am I in great danger, huh?""
Now the mouse had to face the farmer's mouse trap alone.
The very night a sound was heard through the house, like that of a mouse trap catching its
. The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In the darkness, she did not see it was a big poisonous snake whose tail the trap had caught. The snake bit the farmer's wife. The farmer rushed her to the hospital. She returned home with a fever. It is said that drinking fresh chicken soup will help treat fever, so the farmer took his sharp knife to the farmyard for the soup's main ingredient. His wife's sickness continued, so friends and neighbors came to sit with her around the clock. To feed them, the farmer killed the pig. The farmer's wife did not get well, in fact, she died, and so many people came for her funeral. The farmer had the cow killed to provide for all of them to eat.
So next time when someone is facing a problem, don't say that it has nothing to do with you. Remember: when the least of us is threatened, we all might be at risk.",high15627.txt
