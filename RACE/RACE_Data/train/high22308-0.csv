0,B,"['Average food prices rose all over the world.', 'The decrease of crops in America restarted the fight between food and fuel.', 'The argument between farmers and the American livestock industry came up.', 'America produces most of the corn and soybeans in the world.']",What's the main idea of the passage?,"American officials have sharply reduced their expecmtions for this year's corn and soybean crops.Farmers in the Midwest are struggling with record heat and the worst drought in many years.
         The United States is the world's largest producer of com and soybeans.Last Friday the Agriculture Department predicted corn production would add up to 10.8 billion bushels this year.That was down 17%from a prediction made just a month ago.And it was down 13%from last year's level.The average yield per hectare could be the lowest in seventeen years.
         At the sarne time,the government predicted that soybean production would be 12% lower than last year.
         The price of corn has hit record levels.Corn is a major part of animal feed,so the price of meat,milk and eggs is also expected to climb.
The FAO says average food prices worldwide rose 6%in July.The American drought was a big reason.
         The situation has renewed the fight between food and fuel.About 40%of the nation's corn crop goes into making ethanol .The production process leaves some of that in a form that can be fed to animals.Still,at least one-fourth of the American corn crop is now made into fuel.
         The United States requires that part of its corn crop be used in the production of biofuels .The use of ethanol has grown as government requirements have increased.But Jose,the head of the FAO called for""an immediate,temporary pause""of that requirement.He said more of the American corn production could then be used as food or to feed animals.
         The American livestock industry is also urging Congress to stop the law that requires ethanol in gasoline.But corn farmer Alan Bennett says doing that would hurt his town.
         A 2005 law requires automobile fuel to contain ethanol.The growth of the ethanol industry and competition for corn has been helping parts of rural America that had been reducing for years.",high22308.txt
