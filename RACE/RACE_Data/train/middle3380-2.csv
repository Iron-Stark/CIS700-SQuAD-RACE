2,B,"['America', 'Scotland', 'Japan', 'Russia']",The scientist who has cloned a lamb successfully is from  _  .,"A: Recently, the word ""clone"" appeared very often in the newspapers. Do you know its meaning?
B: Not exactly, I read a report in yesterday's newspaper. It said there was a Scottish Dolly. It was the first time that a cloned lamb had been made from an adult sheep.
A: Actually, the word ""clone"" means to produce the ""same"" animal by taking cells from an adult one, I think, if we know how to do cloning, we need only keep a small number of sheep, cows or horses.
B: There's more to it. Recently there have been some people who ever want to clone humans.
A: It seems interesting. But do you think it is possible to do that?
B: No, I don't think so. First I think we cannot clone a dead person, because the cells in his body are dead already.
A: Then we can clone a living person?
B: Again no! You might clone yourself one after another, but it is only a replica , not real you. It is only something, not a human.
A: Now, you mean that a real human can speak, think and create, and these abilities cannot be cloned?
B: True enough! I think the main purpose of Dr. Lan Wilmot, the ""father"" of Dolly, is to make better animals. It has nothing to do with human cloning.
