Searching in San Diego
Dear Searching,
On the Internet, you could easily go looking for love in all the wrong places, but here are lots of great ways to meet singles near you.
The Web is a good place to start. MSN also has international sites for Europe, Australia and South America.
There are several California-based MSN web communities where you can meet like-minded people near you as well as city-specific chat rooms for real-time interaction  . Hope for some clever friends. What about a little more excitement in your online interactions? Try the ""Gaming Zone!""
I also tried MSN Search, looked under the ""Personal"" heading and found ""Relationships"". Clicked on that, then found ""Ads & Personals"", by ""Region"" and found San Diego specific personal from there. Try it!
Also, give ""IRC"" (Internet Relay Chat) and ""Usenet Newsgroups"" a shot. Many a net romance has started and then developed in these off-the-Web communities. If you'd rather make friends F2F (face to face), the Web has some helpful dating and redating tips.",high11000.txt
