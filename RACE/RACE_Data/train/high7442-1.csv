1,B,"['after this space flight, Spaceship One will get the $10m Ansari X-Prize', 'it is dangerous for a spaceship to re-enter the earth atmosphere', 'Terence will be very safe on the flight', 'Spaceship One is just an ordinary plane']",We can infer that  _  .,"A teddy bear from Cumbria is launching into space to raise cash for charity .
Terence, an experienced traveller who has been to Iraq, will be the guest of honour on aviation  legend Burt Rutan's Spaceship One when it flies above Earth. The mission takes off from California on September 29, and on his return the cuddly toy will be auctioned off  in aid of the North Air Ambulance Appeal .
Spaceship One is the world's first private spacecraft, and is competing for a prestigious space travel prize. Chief executive of the Great North Air Ambulance Service (GNAAS), Graham Pickering, said ""flying officer"" Terence had been handed over to the RAF six months ago and staff had been receiving postcards from him ever since.
He said, ""Terence was a fundraising idea that really took off. We have received pictures of him in a U2 craft, trying parachuting and even looking drunk and disorderly. When the RAF finally discharge him he will be a very rare bear indeed--we just hope he does not burn up on re-entry to Earth.""
GNAAS, which needs charitable donations of more than PS2m a year, has three air ambulances .
Peter Bond, spokesman for the Royal Astronomical Society, said Terence's safety was not guaranteed. He said, ""This is a new and experimental craft and this will only be the second time it has flown. During its first voyage it developed technical problems but hopefully they have now been resolved.""
Since May, Terence has spent time with members of 100 Squadron  based at RAF Leeming in Basra, Iraq, and at air shows with performing fighter planes.
Spaceship One will fly 100km (62 miles) above the Earth's surface, just breaking through the planet's atmosphere.
If it repeats the feat  inside two weeks, it will claim the $10m Ansari X-Prize set up to encourage the private space flight business.",high7442.txt
