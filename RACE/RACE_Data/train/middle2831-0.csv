I'm not happy. I have too many rules in my home. On weekdays I have to get up at half past six, read English for half an hour and then walk to school. I can't play with my friend after school because I have to my homework first and then walk my dog. I can't watch TV on school days. And I have to go to bed before ten o'clock, On weekends, I needn't get up at half past six. But I have to get up early, because I have to clean my room and wash my clothes. Then in the afternoon I have to go to the Children's Palace to learn dancing. When I come back, I have to help my mom make dinner. I can't play computer games. I never have fun. What can I do?
Yours,
Linda",middle2831.txt
