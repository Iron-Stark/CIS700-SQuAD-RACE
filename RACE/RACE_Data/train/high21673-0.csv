0,A,"['not dreaming of living a comfortable life', 'avoiding finding unnecessary excuses', 'deciding to change your present life', 'getting in touch with successful people']",All the following ways can contribute to your business EXCEPT   _  .,"What I've noticed about some very successful business owners is that they are always learning and growing.
For your business to be better you need to be better and, you don't get better by doing nothing!
You are the average of the five PEOPLE you hang around with most. Surround yourself with people whom you want to be like.
To do this you may have to get right out of your comfort zone and join in a coaching program, go along to seminars  where you can meet other like-minded people or those playing at a higher level of business than you.
There's no excuse not to  _ and learn your way to success. Regardless of where you are located,events are taking place all around the country regularly as well as online. Saying you have ""no money"" or ""no time"" is not a good enough excuse. 
For many business owners they spend their whole lives using these excuses and going nowhere. Don't focus on where you are now, but where you want to be. You'll find the money and the time if you seriously want to change.
Your ongoing learning can take you from struggling along to soaring high in all areas of your life.
It's been nearly six months since you made those New Year decisions to make changes in your business and your life.
Are you getting the results you wanted?
Is your business more profitable?
Do you have more free time?
Is the quality of your life improving?
Is your answer ""yes"", then take a look at why that is. What have you been doing to get these results? And if you're not moving ahead, seriously look at why that is. When's the last time you read a book, listened to a CD, got coached or attended a seminar to learn how to do things better? The people I know who are getting great results in their business and personal lives are always learning and growing.
You are the Secret to Your Success, so do everything within your power to invest in yourself.",high21673.txt
