1,C,"['She must have been a modest woman', 'She worked as a professional gardener', 'She grew the daffodils over 50 years by herself', 'Being poor, she made a living by selling daffodils']",What do we know from the passage about the woman who grew daffodil?,"Several times my daughter had telephoned to say, ""Mum, you must come and see the daffodils before they are over.""
I wanted to go, but it was a two-hour drive from Lake Arrowhead. ""I will go next Tuesday,"" I promised, a little unwillingly, on her third call.
The next Tuesday dawned cold and rainy. Still, I had promised, and so I drove there. When I finally walked
into Carolyn's house and hugged and greeted my grandchildren, I said, ""Forget the daffodils, Carolyn! Theroad is invisible   in the cloud and fog, and there is nothing in the world except you and thesechildren that I want to see!""
My daughter smiled calmly and said, ""We drive in this weather all the time, Mum. You will never forgive
yourself if you miss this experience.""
After about twenty minutes, we turned onto a small road and I saw a small church. On the far side of the church, I saw a hand-lettered sign that read ""Daffodil Garden""?We got out of the car and each took a child's hand, and I followed Carolyn down the path. Then, we turned a comer of the path, and I looked up amazed. Before me lay the most beautiful sight. Flows of flowers of different colors seemed poured down the peak and slopes. There were five acres of flowers! A seas of daffodil! It was like a fairyland all beyond description.
""But who has done this?"" I asked Carolyn. ""It's just one woman,"" Carolyn answered. That's her home, ""Carolyn pointed to a well-kept A-frame house that looked small and modest in the midst of all that glory. We walked up to the house. On the patio  , we saw a poster."" Answers to the Questions I KnowYou Are Asking"" was the headline.
The first answer was a simple one. ""50,000 bulbs  "" it read. The second answer was, ""One at a time,by one woman."" The third answer was, ""Began in 1958.""
I thought of this woman whom I Had never met, who, more than fifty years before, had begun-one bulb
at a time-to bring the beauty and joy to the mountain top. Just planting one bulb at a time, year after year, had changed the world where she lived and created something of magnificence, beauty, and inspiration.
When we multiply tiny pieces of time with small amounts of daily effort, we too can accomplish great things. Everyone can do something to change the world.",high15019.txt
