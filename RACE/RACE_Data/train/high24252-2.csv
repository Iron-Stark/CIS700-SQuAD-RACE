2,D,"[""There's no need of child-care centers at all."", 'Babies are affected by groups more than by their mothers.', 'Adults should include babies when having social activities.', ""The normal infant-mother bond alone isn't enough for the good mental health for babies.""]",What can be inferred from the result of this study?,"It's not just adults who have a thing or two to discuss with other people, babies too have their own social lives and enjoy group interaction, according to a world-first study.
    The breakthrough study conducted by psychologist Professor Ben Bradley, at Charles Sturt University, could completely transform the way child-care centres are set up. In their study, the researchers examined groups of nine-month-old babies in New South Wales and Britain.
    And they came across astounding  results. It was found that infants had ""social brains"" and focused not just on their mothers but on social life in groups as well.
    ""They communicate with more than one baby at once, and show jealousy and generousness,"" said Professor Bradley. 
    He added, ""They develop their own meanings through group interaction, they notice if a group member is behaving differently and they take on roles, such as leaders and followers.""
""A baby who has a depressed mother tends to be withdrawn (  ), but put that same baby in a group of its peers   and they behave and interact like any other baby.""
It was the first all-baby group study ever to be conducted. ""Most studies of babies concentrate on the infant-mother relationship, assuming that is the single foundation for mental health, but babies are constantly involved with groups of people other than their mothers, fathers, siblings, grandparents and those taking care. Therefore, the mother-baby approach needs to be combined with a group approach,"" said Bradley.
Phoebe Christison, a child-care worker at Camperdown Sunshine Bubs in Sydney's inner west, said she often noticed what appeared to be emotional attachments developed between toddlers.
She said, ""Joel ( 10 months ) and Isabella ( 11 months ) always like to hold hands when they sit in their high chairs and eat. And babies definitely show jealousy. They push and touch each other, and copy what the other is doing.""",high24252.txt
