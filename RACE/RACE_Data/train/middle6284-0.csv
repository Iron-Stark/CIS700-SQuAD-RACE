0,D,"['an active', 'a quiet', 'a hard', 'an easy']",From the passage we know that penguins usually lead   _   life.,"Penguins live together, but each pair has a little piece of ground of their own. When a penguin wants to walk through its neighbor's ground, it must ask for permission . If it does not, it will have to fight. Penguins come and go all day. They fight for fish and look after their children.
All penguins are good parents--the male penguins are perhaps the best parents in the world. They choose their wives in the dark They can only hear them--not see them. Then the female penguins lay their eggs and go away for about two months. The males look after the eggs. If the eggs get cold, there will be no chicks. There is no food. The snow falls and the wind blows--sometimes at 150 kilometers an hour. The penguins do not move.
When the females return from the sea, they will not remember their husbands. It doesn't matter. Only one thing-- their eggs. Male penguins never fight--unless a penguin leaves a chick for a minute. Then they fight because they all want it. They are strange and wonderful birds.",middle6284.txt
