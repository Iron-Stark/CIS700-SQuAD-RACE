1,B,"['2', '28', '30', '31']",How long can't the moon be seen during the daytime in a month?,"A recent survey of 2000 parents in Britain showed that they are often afraid of science questions asked by their curious children only because they have no idea what the answer is. Here is a list of some simple questions that you can ask your parents to see if they know the answers.
Q: Why is the sky blue?
A: You probably know white sunlight is made up of seven colors. While it moves in a straight line when going through space, it starts to divide as it hits ""raised area"" in the atmosphere. The ones with longest wavelengths pass through easily. The blue , however , can be taken in by the gas molecules   because it has a shorter wavelength , which in turn scatters   it in different directions. That's why when you look up at the sky, it appears to be blue.
Q:Why does the moon sometimes appear during the daytime?
A: The simple answer to that is because just like any other object it is being lit by the sun. As long as it is around 45 degrees or even 90 degrees off the sun, it will receive light and be able to be seen. The only time it is not able to be seen during its 28-day orbit   around the earth is when it is right between the earth and the sun. That's because its back , which is not lit by the sun, is facing us.
Q: Where do birds/ honeybees go in winter?
A: While the bird part is quite easy, since a lot of them get together and travel, the honeybee part is likely to puzzle your parents. It turns out that these busy insects stop being that active when the temperature drops below 50degF. Instead ,they get together in the lower central area of the hive  and form a ball around their queen. This helps keep both warm enough to survive the cold winter months.",middle2164.txt
