    The mini knitted garments have helped save hundreds of flightless birds caught in oil spills, providing protection from the elements and stopping them from eating poisonous pollution.
    Knits tor Nature,a program run by The Penguin Foundation,which protects the little penguin population of Phillip Island,140km south-east of Melbourne,has created up to 300 different designs over the years--and it's all thanks to talented volunteers.
    ""There's a lot of hidden creativity out there,""said Lyn Blom,of the Phillip Island Nature Park.""People love to know that they're helping the penguins because they're so cute and small and they waddle up the beach and they're so strong and determined.But they need to be,they 1ive in a pretty tough sort of environment.''
    A thumbnail--sized patch of oil can kill a little penguin,the smallest of the species,measuring just l3 inches and weighing l kg.The oil separates and mats their feathers,breaking natural waterproofing and heating functions.
Ms Blom estimates she has knitted between 200 and 300 penguin jumpers over the years.
A staff member read an article in an English women's magazine about knitting for guillemot birds and decided to adapt the designs.
    ""There's a lot of ladies out there who used to knit for their children and grandchildren.These ladies have spare wool and idle hands,and they love to feel loved and needed and we love and need them,""said Ms Blom.
    The Pengu in Foundation recently staged a competition for the most creative jumper,which received an enthusiastic response.
    The Penguin Foundation rescues approximately 20 birds a year.They even have a stockpile of jumpers in case of emergency-such as the large oil spill Phillip Island in 2001. In that instance,453 little penguins were affected,96 percent of which were saved-most thanks to the jumpers.",high18063.txt
