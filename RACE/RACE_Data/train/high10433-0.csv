0,D,"['Exploring a new place alongside her mother.', 'Visiting favorite cities with her mother.', 'Looking both ways when crossing the street.', ""Offering help to others when it's possible.""]",Which life lesson does Katka think the most valuable?,"Hey, mom, I want you to stop dropping me off at the airport for some trip that I am about to take and start becoming my seatmate.  I want to travel with you---just you.
I want to explore a new place alongside a woman who raised me, who put up with my teenager anxiety and my rebellious   college years.  I want to see my favorite cities with the lady who taught me basic life lessons, such as looking both ways before crossing the street, how to use a glue gun, and that the most important thing in the world is to help others.
I always appreciated the vacations you planned for our family. I also remember how you watched me as I read The Great Gatsby on the balcony at midday.  I wonder if you felt proud of me.  These days, I am sick of traveling to places with wishy-washy  friends.  I want to travel with a strong woman who can see how capable I am of learning to speak French or hiking on a glacier or eating something as unpleasant-smelling fruit.
Now I want you to see how much I grow up while abroad---I'm a different person, Mom.  And I know you'd be different too.  I know that someone has shared a similar burst of emotion while diving into Australia's Great Barrier Reef for the first time.
So what do you say, Mom? Will you _ ? I want to travel with you.  Let's just go---we can go anywhere in the world, just you and I.  You can pick the place, and I will do the rest.
Love,
Katka",high10433.txt
