I'm  writing to you on your third birthday. I want to tell you something about your grandma's time. I was born sixty-eight years ago in a small village.
Transportation used to be a big problem. When we travelled from village to village, we used to walk or ride horses.
Shopping was not an easy job, either. There were no supermarkets in the neighborhood. We used to grow most of our own food: rice and vegetables. We kept things cool in a special underground room.
The biggest difference is that you have electricity. We didn't have electricity until very late in our small village. We didn't have any televisions of course. We used to perform our local music and enjoy it very much.
Life used to be very hard, but I was not upset. I would like you to know about the old days and be happy about what you have. Remember , feeling good about life is the key to happiness.
Love
Your grandma",middle7787.txt
