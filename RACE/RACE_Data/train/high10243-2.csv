On a mere 1/10 of an acre in Los Angeles, Loe and her family grow, can and preserve much of the food they consume.
Loe is a master food preserver, gardener and canning expert. She also operates a website, where she shares her tips and recipes, with the goal of demonstrating that every has the ability to control what's on their plate.
Loe initially went to school to become an engineer, but she quickly learned that her enthusiasm was mainly about growing and preparing her own food. ""I got into cooking my own food and started growing my own herbs   and foods for that fresh flavor,""she said. Engineer by day, Loe learned cooking at night school. She ultimately purchased a small piece of land with her husband and began growing their own foods.
""I teach people how to live farm-fresh without a farm,"" Loe said. Through her website Loe emphasizes that ""anybody can do this anywhere."" Got an apartment with a balcony  ? Plant some herbs. A window? Perfect spot for growing. Start with herbs, she recommends, because ""they're very forgiving."" Just a little of the herbs ""can take your regular cooking to a whole new level,"" she added. ""I think it's a great place to start."" ""Then? Try growing something from a seed, she said, like a tomato or some tea.""
Canning is a natural extension of the planting she does. With every planted food. Loe noted, there's a moment when it's bursting with its absolute peak flavor. ""I try and keep it in a time capsule in a canning jar,"" Loe said. ""Canning for me is about knowing what's in your food, knowing where it comes from.""
In addition to being more in touch with the food she's eating, another joy comes from passing this knowledge and this desire for good food to her children: ""Influencing them and telling them your opinion on not only being careful what we eat but understanding _ ,"" she said, ""that if we don't take care of the earth, no will.""",high10243.txt
