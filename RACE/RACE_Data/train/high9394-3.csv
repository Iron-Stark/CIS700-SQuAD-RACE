3,D,"['Every little thing helps.', 'Make hay   while the sun shines.', 'Accidents will happen.', 'One good turn deserves another.']",Which of the following proverbs suits the story the best?,"One dark and stormy night, an elderly man and his wife entered the hall of a small hotel in Philadelphia, hoping to get shelter for the night.
The clerk, a friendly man with a beautiful smile, explained that there were three conferences in town. ""All of our rooms are taken,"" the clerk said, ""but I can't send a nice couple like you into the rain at one o'clock in the morning. Would you perhaps be willing to sleep in my room? It's not a suite, but it will be good enough to make you comfortable for the night."" The couple agreed.
As the elderly man paid the bill the next morning, he told the clerk, ""You are the kind of person who should be the boss of the best hotel in the United States. Maybe someday I'll build one for you."" The clerk looked at them and smiled. The three of them had a good laugh.
Two years passed. The clerk had almost forgotten the incident when he received a letter from the elderly man, asking the clerk to pay him a visit. The elderly man met him in New York, and led him to the corner of the Fifth Avenue and 34thStreet. He then pointed to a great new building there, a reddish stone one with watchtowers thrusting   up to the sky, and told the clerk that it was the hotel he had just built for him to manage.
That wonderful building was the original Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. And this young clerk whose name was George C. Boldt never foresaw the return of events that would lead him into the manager of one of the world's most attractive hotels.",high9394.txt
