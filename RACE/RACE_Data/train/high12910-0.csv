0,B,"['Lang Lang and His Music', 'UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador', 'An Unforgettable Visit to Africa', ""Lang Lang's Fundraising Concerts""]",The best title of the passage is  _  .,"He is not just a classical music superstar. He is a global superstar. Only 27 years old, the Chinese pianist Lang Lang has become an inspiration to tens of millions around the world.
Among his dazzling long list of titles, Lang considered UNICEF goodwill ambassador the most special one.
""Being a UNICEF goodwill ambassador is the best decision I have made and will definitely be the best experience in my life,"" Lang said in a recent interview with Xinhua at the UN headquarters in New York.

Named this year by Time magazine as one of the 100 World's Most Influential People, the pianist said he hoped music could ""bring children happiness and enlighten their life.""
Three months after his nomination  , Lang went to Tanzania with the UNICEF team to visit children threatened by malaria  and AIDS.
Although the southeastern African country's underdevelopment and harsh living conditions surprised Lang who landed the continent for the first time, he was touched by local children's passion for music.
""Most of the kids had never seen a piano before,"" Lang said. ""When I played Chopin's nocturne or waltz to them, those who were too shy to talk to me suddenly became active and began to share with me about their dreams. How amazing it is!"" ""Music can bring hopes to the kids and open their mind,"" he said.
Following his visit to Africa, Lang began to organize fundraising concerts for children. Now it has become his routine to do 15 to 20 fundraising concerts every year.
Except for his efforts on fundraising, Lang also established his own international music foundation last year to assist young talents to play piano.
So far Lang has chosen five children from the United States and Germany, providing them with scholarships and opportunities to perform at world-class music halls, he said.
In December, he will start the selection in China where he would like to ""focus more on physically challenged kids, like blind kids.""",high12910.txt
