0,D,"['Because it was a fine day indeed,', 'Because he wanted the writer to look at the bill carefully.', 'Because he wanted to tell the writer what the weather was like.', ""Because he didn't want the writer to go through the bill carefully.""]",Why did Henry talk about weather when the writer was looking at the bill?,"Henry was a carpenter of our village. Once I asked him to make a dining table for my wife. He made it just the right size to fill the space between the two windows. When I arrived home that evening, Henry was drinking a cup of tea and writing out his bill for his work.. My wife said to me, quietly,""That's his ninth cup of tea today."" But she said loudly, ""It's a beautiful table,dear,isn't it?"" ""I won't decide about that until I see that bill."" I said.
Henry laughed and gave me his bill for the work. It said:
BILL
One dining table June 10,1995
Cost of wood 17.00
Paint  1.50
Work,8 hours(1 an hour) 8.00
Total  36.50
When I was looking at the bill,Henry said,""It's been a fine day,hasn't it?"" "" Quite sunny."" ""Yes,""I said. ""I'm glad it is only the 10th of June."" ""Me too,"" said Henry, ""You wait--it'll be a bit hotter by the end of the month."" ""Yes. Hotter--and more expensive. Dining tables will be 20 more expensive on June 30th,won't they,Henry?""
Henry looked hard at me for half a minute. There was a little smile in his two blue eyes. I gave his bill back to him. ""If it isn't too much trouble,Henry,""I said,""Please add it up again. You can forget the date.""
I paid him 26. 50 and he was happy to get it.",middle502.txt
