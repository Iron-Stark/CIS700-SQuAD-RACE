From busy homemakers to working people, many Americans enjoy the convenience   of fast food that can be ready to serve in 10 minutes or less.

Probably every cook has his or her own way of cooking. But there are some basic skills that most people follow. For example, baking is a main method   of preparing food in America. For that reason, Americans would find it next to impossible to live without an oven. American cooks pay special attention to the balance of foods, too. In planning a big meal they try to include meat, a few vegetables, some bread and often a dessert. They also like to make sure the meal is colorful. Having several different colors of food on the plate usually makes for a healthy meal.
