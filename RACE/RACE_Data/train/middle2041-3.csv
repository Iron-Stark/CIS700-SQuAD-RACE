3,A,"['blue', 'yellow', 'green', 'white']",He is   _   today. It means his father is ill.,"Mary can't understand such sentences as ""She is blue today."" ""You are yellow."" ""He has a green thumb  ."" ""He tells a white lie."" and so on. And she goes to her teacher for help.
Mary: Mrs. Smith, there is a colour in each of these sentence. What do they mean?
Mrs. Smith: In everyday English, blue sometimes means sad. Yellow, afraid. A person with a green thumb grows plants well. And a white lie is not a bad one.
Mary: Would you please give me an example of a white lie?
Mrs. Smith: Certainly. Now I give you some cake. In fact, you don't like it. But you won't say it. Instead, you say, "" No, thanks. I'm not hungry."" That's a white lie.
Mary: Oh, I see. Thank you very much.",middle2041.txt
