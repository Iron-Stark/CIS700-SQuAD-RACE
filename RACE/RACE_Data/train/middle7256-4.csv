4,B,"['under the small tree', 'on the coat', 'in the field', 'beside the coat']","When the writer's father found Wangwang, he was sitting   _  .","Many people like animals and raise one or more as pets--dogs, cat or some kinds of birds. I love dogs, too. My aunt gave me a dog on my birthday. We call it Wangwang. It is a little black dog. He is friendly and helpful. Most of the time he likes to run and play with me. Sometimes he follows my father around in the fields.
One day, my father took off his grey coat and put it on the ground under a big tree. Wangwang stood watching him. My father said, ""Watch over my coat, Wangwant."" Wangwant sat down beside the coat. My father went on working. After he finished his work, he forgot all about his coat and went home. Late in the evening I didn't see my dog. I looked everywhere for him calling, ""Wangwang, Wangwang!"" But Wangwang didn't come back. Soon my father wanted something that was in his coat pocket. Then he remembered what he had done. He went back to the big tree. What do you think he saw? Wangwang was sitting on the coat so that nobody could take it away.",middle7256.txt
