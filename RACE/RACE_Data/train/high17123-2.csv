2,D,"['children may be misled by private tutors', 'the quality of private tutoring may be poor', 'the education that children receive in class is enough for them', 'children may not have the real ability to deal with their further studies']",Elaine Tyrrell doesn't encourage parents to hire private tutors for their children mainly because_.,"On the whole, it's not something we parents shout about, but one in four of us does it.Hiring private tutors for our children is now widespread.And this year, as always,the Easter holidays will be peak time  for tutor demand.
""My husband and I tried to tutor her at home,but we found all our knowledge was out of date and we were only confusing Zarreen.We also tried a group revision course but all the children were sitting exams for different boards .

Besides, our biggest worry is that they might just get in with the help of last-minute tutoring,but,once they actually get to that school,they won't be able to manage."" 
It's a point worth considering.After all,who would want their child to stay at the bottom of the class?",high17123.txt
