We meet on Mondays at 14:30 at the IWC clubhouse. We chat for about an hour and discuss everything. Mandi asks ""students"" to contact her on Monday to confirm the class as sometimes she needs to cancel for various reasons or occasionally she may choose to hold the class at a different venue  or at an earlier time for us to be able to have lunch together.

I'm French (born in Bordeaux) and Swiss by marriage. I hold an advanced beginners' French conversation class on Tuesday afternoons from 14:30 16:00. We meet weekly at the clubhouse in a friendly atmosphere. I hope to help you use your knowledge of French, allowing you to speak with no fear of making mistakes, which in time will become fewer and fewer.

The first half of the class is devoted to reading out loud from the book ""Easy French Reader"", working on pronunciation and phrasing. During the second half, we listen to audio recordings from ""New French with Ease"" and work on oral comprehension.
