1,C,"['Kate has dreamt of being a pilot since she was a little girl.', 'Kate made a move so that she could be closer to the airport.', 'Kate likes experiencing something different.', 'Kate has been the youngest ever female captain.']",What can be inferred from the passage?,"If Kate McWilliams got a penny every time someone asked how old she was she would be on to a good thing.
Easyjet says the 26-year-old is its youngest ever commercial female airline captain.
She flies to around 100 destinations across the world and says most people ""are pleasantly surprised and impressed"" when she tells them her age.
But Kate isn't the youngest ever female captain.Ronan Milne got in touch with Newsbeat to say his colleague Dawn Hunter was made a captain aged 24 at Loganair.Sarah Hendry is also 24 and a captain with the same company.
Kate began flying in the air cadets  when she was 13 years old, but admitted to the Press Association that she never thought she could become a commercial pilot.However, following aviation training in Southampton, she joined easyJet as a co-pilot in May 2011.This August she took up the rank of captain after passing the airline's command course.
""Personally I don't think my age matters,"" she said. ""I've been through the same training and passed the same command course as every other captain so I've proven myself capable regardless of my age.""
Kate is originally from Carlisle, but now lives in Surrey so she can be near to Gatwick Airport.From there she flies Airbus A319 and A32 planes to locations across the world, including Iceland, Israel and Morocco.""I rarely fly to the same place twice in the same month,"" she said. ""That keeps things interesting.""
Around 5% of commercial pilots are women.Last year easyJet announced a plan to increase its number of female entrants to 12%.Julie Westhorp, chairwoman of the British Women Pilots' Association (BWPA), hopes Kate will inspire more women to think about working in aviation.She says: ""Both the BWPA and easyJet are aware of the importance of visible role models for girls and young women when making career choices and continue to work together to encourage young women to consider a pilot career.""",high14708.txt
