0,B,"['Put your head out and look outside', 'Be careful', 'Come out and have a look', 'Both A and B']","What is the possible meaning of ""look out"" in this passage?","One day three Frenchmen who did not know English very well were talking about the English language.
The first Frenchman said, 'I heard someone shout 'look out' ,I put my head out of a window and a basin of water fell on me. It seems that 'look out' may mean 'don't look out!'
The second one followed, ' I was once on a ship and heard the captain  shout, 'All hands on the deck ' I put my hands on the deck and someone trod on them.'
The third one told his friends his experience too, 'One early morning I called on my English friend and the maid  said, 'He is not up yet, come back in half an hour.' When I went again for him, she said, 'He's not down yet.'I said, 'If he's not up and he is not down, where is he then?    What a strange language it is!'",middle339.txt
