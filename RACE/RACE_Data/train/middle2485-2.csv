2,A,"['have to find better ways to teach', 'find it easier to teach', 'spend 45 minutes explaining to the students', 'are happy to explain for only 15 minutes']",The teachers   _   after the reform.,"One morning, Wu Li discovered that her classroom had changed. She found that the desks were no longer in rows , but pushed together to make eight bigger desks. She was too excited about it for the first two days and she couldn't listen to the teachers carefully. But soon she and her classmates got used to this new classroom arrangement  . ""Now our class is quieter,"" said Wu. ""What's more, we can come up with our own ideas and learn more through discussion. It's a better way to study.""
Li Yu liked it, too. He said, ""Group members first discuss, and then show ourselves in front of the whole class. It makes us believe in ourselves."" It was part of a reform   at Li's school--Baita Secondary School. The school made this reform because they wanted to provide students with easier ways to study and more chances to discuss. ""Our school hopes it can improve students' abilities   to study by themselves and work in groups,"" said Zhang Yong, the principal of the school.
However, the reform has demanded   more from teachers. Now they have only about 15 minutes to give the lesson which should be taught in 45 minutes before. It is difficult to teach in such a short time. The teachers have to find better ways to teach more _ .
""The reform demands more, but I'm sure it is helpful,"" added Mr Zhang.",middle2485.txt
