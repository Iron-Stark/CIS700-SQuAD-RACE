0,C,"['Joyful.', 'Lucky.', 'Sympathetic.', 'Shameful.']",How did the girl feel when she thought of other homeless kids?,"A little homeless girl stood crying near a small church from which she had been turned away because it was too crowded. "" I can't go to Sunday school."" She cried to the priest   as he walked by. The priest took her inside. The child was very happy because they found a room for her. She went to bed that night thinking of the children who had no place to sleep or pray in.
Two years later, the girl died there. As her little body was being moved, a worn and red purse was found, which she had found in the rubbish. Inside the purse was 57cents and a note, written in childish handwriting, which read: ""This is to help make the little church bigger so more children can go to Sunday school.""
After the priest tearfully read that note, he told the story of her unselfish love and devotion  to others. Soon, a newspaper reported on it. It was read by a wealthy man who offered the church a piece of land worth many thousands of dollars. When told that the church could not pay much, he offered to sell it to the little church for 57 cents. Soon, the church collected a large amount of money. Within five years, the girl's gift had increased to $250,000. When you are in the city of Philadelphia, visit Temple Baptist Church, Temple University, and the Sunday school building. No child here is left outside on Sunday school days again. One of the rooms of the Sunday school building is hanged with the picture of the sweet face of the little girl whose 57 cents made such a remarkable and real history.",high8141.txt
