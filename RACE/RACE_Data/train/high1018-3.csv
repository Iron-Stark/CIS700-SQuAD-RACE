When Micheal began a story I was sure he had told before, I gave him a kick under the table. There was no response, so I gave him another kick. Still the story went on.

Later, on the dance floor, I asked my husband why it had taken him so long to get my message. ""What do you mean?"" he replied. ""I cut off the story as soon as you kicked me.""
""But I kicked you twice, and it still took you a while to stop!""
