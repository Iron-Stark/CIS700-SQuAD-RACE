0,D,"[""It's a good example of how differences make us different"", 'It encourages children to love their family and friends', 'The farmer kills Wibur as dinner', 'Charlotte is loving and helpful although she is ugly']",Which of the following about the story is TRUE?,"Sometimes two very different individuals  become the best friends. For example,, who could have thought that a spider would become friends with a pig? But in American writer E.B.White' novel Charlotte's Web, this is exactly what happens
Wibur the pig grows up in a barn  and makes many friends, including a spider called Charlotte. One day a sheep tells Wibur that he will finally be served up as dinner. But Charlotte decides to save her friend. To help Wibur,Charlotte writes words like ""terrific"", ""radiant"" and ""humble"" on her web to praise Wibur. This makes the farmer believe that is too important to kill.Wibur is saved, but Charlotte is so tired that she dies.
The book was first published in 1952.  In over 60 years Charlotte has become one of the most famous spiders of all time. She teaches us about love and promise. ""She is very, very loving under that crusty ,that ugly look,""  Peter Neumeyer, writer of The Annotated Charlott's Web
The book's success drew the attention of Hollywood filmmakers , however, they wanted a happier ending. White was strongly against this idea and as a result the film, like the book, ends with Charlotte's death.
Jen Doll, reporter with The Atlantic, believe that ""death is a part of life"". She says this is one of the main messages of the book.
As Charlotte tells Wibur, ""You have been my friend. That in itself is a wonderful thing. I wove my webs for you because I like you. After all, what's a life, anyway? We're born, we live a little while and then we die. A spider's life can't help being something of a mess , with all this trapping and eating flies. By helping you, perhaps I was trying to lift up my life a little. God knows anyone's life can stand a little of that.""",high8026.txt
