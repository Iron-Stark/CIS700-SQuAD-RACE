1,C,"['$20. 00', '$46. 50', '$56. 50', '$26. 50']",The writer thought John would ask for   _   if he made a dining table on the last day of November.,"Our village carpenter   , John, came one day and made a dining table for my wife. He made it just the right size for the space between the two windows. When I got home that evening, John was drinking a cup of tea and writing out his bill for the job.
My wife said to me quietly,""That's his ninth cup of tea today. ""But she said, in a loud voice,""It's a beautiful table, dear, isn't it?""
""I'll decide about that when I see the bill. ""I said.
John laughed and gave me his bill for the work. I read:
One dining table                        10 November, 1998
Cost of wood                            $17. 00
Paint                                   $1. 50
Work, 8 hours ( $1 an hour )            $8. 00
Total                                   $36. 50
When I was looking at the bill, John said, ""It's been a nice day, hasn't it?Quite sunny. ""
""Yes. ""I said. "" I'm glad it's only the tenth of November. ""
""Me, too. ""said John. ""You wait -- it'll be a lot colder by the end of the month. ""
""Yes,colder -- and more expensive! A dining table will be $20 more expensive on November 30, won't it, John?""
John looked hard at me for half a minute. Was there a little smile in his two blue eyes?I gave his bill back to him.
""If there isn't too much trouble, John,"" I said,""please add it up again. You can forget the date...""
I paid him $26. 50 and he was happy to get it.",middle3170.txt
