0,B,"['Her brothers.', 'Her parents.', 'Her friend.', 'Her doctor.']",Who taught Bethany surfing when she was very young?,"Bethany Meilani Hamilton was born on February 8, 1990 Kauai, Hawaii, where she grew up with two older brothers.  Hamilton's parents were both surfers and they started teaching Bethany how to surf at a young age, and she learned quickly with the support of her brothers. By age 8, Bethany was winning first place in surfing contests for her age group. Hamilton began competing more seriously at the age of nine, winning several more competitions in her age group.
On October 31, 2003, while surfing with friends near Tunnels Beach, a 14-foot tiger shark attacked her. Bethany said, ""My arm was hanging in the water, and it just came and bit me. It kind of pulled me back and forth. But I just held onto my board and then the shark let go."" The shark tore off Bethany's left arm just below her shoulder.  Hamilton's friends rushed her to the hospital. Bethany made it through several surgeries without infection  , and miraculously survived even though she had lost almost 60% of her blood.  The doctor said that her athletic training helped her to survive the attack and blood loss.
While she was healing, Bethany thought for a while that she might not surf again. She was concerned that it would be much harder to stand up on the board using only one hand and that her balance would be completely off. But with hard work and determination she returned to surfing. She says, ""It's hard for me to describe the joy I felt after I stood up and rode a wave in for the first time after the attack.  I was greatly thankful and happy inside. The tiny bit of doubt that would sometimes tell me 'you'll never surf again' was gone in one wave !""
As for fear of another shark attack, Bethany says that sometimes her heart pounds when she sees a shadow   under the water. But she believes that faith provides hope and a future for those who feel down and defeated in their lives.
Bethany's popularity and hope for the future led her to partner with World Vision to create ""Surfing for Children in Crisis"".  Bethany hopes that her involvement in the campaign will help provide disabled children from around the world with care, support, and hope.",high12911.txt
