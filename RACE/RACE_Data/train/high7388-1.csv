1,B,"['the BMD loss may cause serious illness to astronauts', ""the BMD loss may cause some change in astronauts' bodies"", ""astronauts shouldn't care about the BMD loss"", 'astronauts should take some calcium before space travel']",Scientists have found that   _  .,"Space travel is definitely bad for astronauts' bones, reducing their bone density  after only a month of weightlessness, according to French research published on Friday.
Laurence Vico and his fellow workers at St Etienne University called for more research into the effects of microgravity, after their study of 15 astronauts from the Russian MIR station showed bone loss continued throughout space flights.
""Bone loss was especially striking in four astronauts, "" the scientists reported in the Lancet Medical Journal.
They measured the bone mineral density (BMD) of bones in the forearm  and lower leg of the astronauts who had spent one to six months in space.
The BMD loss was significant in the tibia  of the lower leg, a weight-bearing bone, but barely changed in the radius  of the forearm. ""Our results indicate the need to investigate not only different bones, but also different areas of the same bone since not all sites of the skeleton   are similarly affected by space conditions, "" they added.
Without gravity the body isn't bearing any weight so there is no need for calcium   which makes bones strong, and it becomes empty into the bloodstream.
The research team suggested in future scientists should try to determine if the loss of bone density was only on weight-bearing bones on longer flights, also the possible recovery after returning to Earth.",high7388.txt
