2,B,"['The UN Environment Program.', 'Consumers who buy electronics.', 'President and founder of Redemtech.', 'Guiyu city in Southeastern China.']","In the     writer's opinion, who can first shoulder the    great responsibility to guarantee e-waste is handled proper in the future?","These days it's cheaper to throw that broken DVD player, cell-phone or TV out and buy a new one. This "" replace-rather-than-repair"" mentality is polluting the planet with electronic waste. According to the UN Environment Program, we are throwing away an estimated 50 million metric tonnes of electronics waste    (e-waste) per year. But this is not ordinary garbage. Our electronics leak harmful heavy metals -- such as mercury and arsenic -- along with equally poisonous chemicals that end up in our soil and eventually our water.
You've probably participated in a community recycling event and left feeling good about shipping off that old computer to be recycled. Chances are it was shipped overseas where it's polluting someone else'community.
Guiyu city in Southeastern China has become known as the e-waste city where low-paid workers use whatever means available to remove electronics in hopes of recovering the copper, microchips, aluminum, gold and silver and plastic that can be resold. Any leftover waste is simply thrown into the nearby river or piled up high in the streets, poisoning the children growing up here.
So what can you do with your e-waste? Robert Houghton, President and founder of Redemtech, an asset management and recovery firm, recommends you vote with your dollar. Buy from companies who have a take-back program that guarantees your discarde electronics are handled proper.
"" Consumers want to do business with companies who are demonstrably     good with corporate responsibility and dealing with e-waste, "" said Houghton.
