0,D,"['Because he was very short.', 'Because he was very foolish.', 'Because he has no eyes.', 'Because he has no ears.']",Why was the boy laughed at at school?,"One day a doctor said to the boy's father that he could graft a pair of ears for his son, if they could be offered. Two years went by. Then, ""You are going to the hospital, son. Mother and I have someone who will _ the ears you need. But it's a secret,"" said the father.
The operation was a brilliant success. Later the boy married and entered the diplomatic service . ""But I must know who gave so much to me. I could never do enough for him."" ""But the agreement was that you are not to know... not yet,"" said the father. The years kept their secret, but the day did come... one of the darkest days that ever passed through his son. Slowly, the father stretched forth a hand and raised the thick, reddish-brown hair to show... that the mother had no ears.
""Mother said she was glad she never let her hair be cut,"" he whispered gently, ""and nobody ever thought mother less beautiful, did they?""
