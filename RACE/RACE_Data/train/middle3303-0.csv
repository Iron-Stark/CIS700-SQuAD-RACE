0,C,"['To get a morning eating part', 'To organize the play', 'To get a large acting part.', 'To work the lights.']",What did the boy want to do in the play?,"My class will put on a short play in English at the end of the year. Yesterday our English teacher gave us copies of the play.
""Choose a character in the play whom you'd like to be, ""she told us. ""This afternoon learn a few lines of this part for homework. Then tomorrow you can say those lines in front of the class. Ill decide who play each part.""
I wanted to have one of the bigger parts in the play, so I choose the part of the king. He has a lot of lines to say. I learned them by heart.
This morning in our English lesson we had to say our lines. I acted the part of the king. When I said my lines, I put a lot of expression into my acting. I thought I acted really well.
Everyone in the class read a part and then the teacher who would play each part.
Many of the students in my class couldn't act at all. They couldn't even read without making lots of mistakes. I was sure that I would get a big part in the play.
However, the teacher gave me the part of a soldier. He has only one line. It is, ""Yes, sir!""
I was very disappointed. At the end of the lesson I went up to her and asked her why I had such a small part.
""You put too much _ in your acting,"" she said. ""Good acting is not big acting. It is acting the audience can believe in.""
I think I know what she means.",middle3303.txt
