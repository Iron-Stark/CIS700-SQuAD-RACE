Every day it is a lot of time to get there. The road is not flat , so I cannot go to school by bike. I often get there by bus or on foot. It takes me thirty minutes to get there by bus and an hour on foot. I must get up early every morning. I have no time for breakfast at home. I often have something for breakfast on the way or on the bus. I don' t want to be late for school, so sometimes I run to school.",middle7151.txt
