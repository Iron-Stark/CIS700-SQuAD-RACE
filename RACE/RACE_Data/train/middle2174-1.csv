1,B,"['He works as a teacher there.', 'He helps the children there.', 'He watches the games there.', 'He does sports with his sons.']",What does the father often do in Ray Home?,"My brother and I often fight with each other over small things. One day our father said to us, ""Tomorrow we will take part in the Ray Home Sports Day. Both of you must go with me. Perhaps you can learn something from those children."" My brother laughed, ""Dad, Ray is a home for physically disabled children. What can we learn from them?""
""You will see,"" our father said.
Our father works as a volunteer at Ray. The children there have problems with their hands, speech, walking or hearing. Every day, he spends hours helping them to move or exercise their legs or arms.
The following day, he took us to Ray Home. When we got there, we found a nice place to sit down. Finally, the sports began. There was a 50-meter race to see who could run fastest. All the runners were physically disabled. As the race started, all the children moved as fast as they could. Just then, one of the girls fell over and hurt her leg. She began to cry at the top of her voice.
All the children stopped to help the poor girl. Then they all held hands and finished the race together. My brother and I were surprised to see this: the children weren't interested in winning the race-they were more interested in helping each other to finish the race.",middle2174.txt
