1,A,"['They will eat part of the trash.', 'They will stop working.', 'They will tell people where it is.', 'They will take it out to the beach.']",What will the robot fish do if they swim in the water?,"Scientists will put some robot fish into the sea near Spain this year. These robot fish will help people find out the pollution in the water. If the robot fish are able to finish their work successfully, the team of scientists hopes the fish will be used in rivers, lakes and seas around the world.
The robot fish are about 1.5 meters long. There is a detector  in their bodies. It can find the pollution in the water, and then the robot fish will eat part of it.
They can ""swim"" for eight hours in the sea freely and send back information to people on the beach. After their energy runs down, they will go back to the beach by themselves.
There are five robot fish altogether. Each costs about 29,000 dollars. They are part of a three-year project between engineering company BMT Group and Essex University in southeastern England.
