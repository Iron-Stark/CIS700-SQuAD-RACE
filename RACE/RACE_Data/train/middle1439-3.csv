Make rules for Internet use with your parents. For example, when you can go online, for how long and what activities you can do online.
Don't give your password to anyone else, and never give out the following information: your real name ,home address, age, school, phone number or other personal information.
Check with your parents before giving out a credit card number.
Never send a photo of yourself to someone in e-mail unless your parents say it's OK.
Check with your parents before going into a chat room. Different chat rooms have different rules and attract different kinds of people. You and your parents will want to make sure it's a right place for you.
Never agree to meet someone you met on the Internet without your parent's permission. Never meet anyone you met online alone.
Always remember that people online may not be who they say they are. Treat everyone online as if they were strangers.

Treat other people as you'd like to be treated. Never use bad language.
Remember that not everything you read on the Internet is true.",middle1439.txt
