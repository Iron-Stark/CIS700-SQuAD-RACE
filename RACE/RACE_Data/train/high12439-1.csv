Hong Kong Disneyland announced on Tuesday it will raise weekday admission prices for mainland and overseas tourists by about 19 percent.But Hong Kong residents and tourists who purchase tickets through travel agents can still enjoy the old prices until June 30.
A one-day admission will cost HK $350($45)for adults and HK $250 for children aged up to 11 from Monday, the previous charges for weekends.Adults were previously admitted for HK $295 and children HK $210.
A Hong Kong Disneyland spokesman said the park does not expect the new pricing structure to have an immediate impact on attendances, as research shows guests choose when to visit the attraction based on time available rather than ticket prices.But the hikes(the rise of prices)drew immediate criticism from the industry.The greater tourism industry fears it may harm mainlanders willingness to visit Hong Kong.
Joseph Tung Yao-chung, executive director of Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong, said the decision was unwise in the current financial climate.He also urged the company to rethink its decision, during an interview with Southern Metropolis Daily.",high12439.txt
