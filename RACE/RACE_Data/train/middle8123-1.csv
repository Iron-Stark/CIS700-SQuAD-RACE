1,D,"['A book', 'A dog', 'A black car', 'big rubbish bag']",What did he take when he went to the forest to pick up the litter?,"Editor's note: do you care about the environment  ? Have you ever wanted to help protect it ? Well read on, as this month we're going to hear from overseas teens about what they do to help the environment.
I can't remember when I started collecting litter . But it was when I got tired of seeing litter near my home and realized that no one else was going to pick it up.
I live close to a forest in Ohio, America. I can walk there in three minutes!
I used to love going there to play with my dog. But one day there was so much litter there that I became very unhappy. I decided I had to clean up the forest. I wanted to feel happy going there again.
I made my first trip to clean the forest that afternoon. I took a big black rubbish bag with me. Ten minutes after starting to pick up litter, my bag was full! It had cans, bottles, broken glass and newspapers in it.
Since that first trip three years ago. I've gone to the forest four times a year to pick up litter. I'm often there for three hours. It makes me feel great to do something for the environment.
After each trip, I look at all the litter I've found. If any of it is recyclable , I keep it.I can't understand why people drop litter. But I will keep picking it up until they stop dropping it.
I know I am only doing a small bit to help the earth, but I still think it is important.",middle8123.txt
