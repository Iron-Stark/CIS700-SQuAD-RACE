3,A,"['They are friendly.', 'They are funny.', 'They are smart.', 'They are strict.']",What does Jenny think of her two new friends?,"Dear Dad and Mom,
How are you? I'm happy here, but I miss you very much. It's Sunday today, I don't have any classes. I am writing an e-mail to you in the computer room now.
There are lots of students in the computer room. Some students are talking with their friends on QQ. Some students are playing computer games. Some students are watching movies on computers. My new friends, Peter and Bill, are here with me. Peter is buying a T-shirt on the Internet. And what is Bill doing? Oh, he is reading a book on the computer. They're friendly and they often help me with my study and life. When you come to Shanghai, I want you to meet them.
I'm OK in Shanghai. Please don't worry   about me. I hope you are happy and well.
Love,
Jenny",middle7365.txt
