0,D,"['They make people rich.', 'They bring people happiness all the time.', 'They make people younger.', 'They bring people together.']",What's the idea of Vlad to the sports?,"Are Sports Important?
Sports are all around us. We watch and read sports news. There are also sports clubs,
and even sports-only channels  on TV. In many countries, players make millions of dollars every year. But why are sports so important? They're only games, right?
Our readers answer:
Vlad (Ukraine)
Sports bring people together. In 2006, our team was able to play in the 2006 World Cup for the first time. Everyone was happy. Rich and poor, old and young, men and women--everyone was in the streets together!
Mike (U.S.A.)
Sports bring people together, but they divide them too. Fans of different teams fight all the Time
-they shout and hit each other. And here's another example: My brother plays high school baseball.Last week, his team played an important game. At the game, two parents fought about a call .
Come on ... baseball is only a game! Sports are so competitive   these days. It's all about winning. Then the game isn't fun.
Oba (South Africa)
Right now, some of the world's best soccer players are from African countries, and the 2010
World Cup games will be held in South Africa. Yes, some players make a lot of money--maybe too much, but sporting events (like the World Cup) bring tourists and money to countries
and people. And that is good for Africa.",middle6081.txt
