2,B,"['how ""Gangnam Style"" becomes popular among the youths', 'why ""Gangnam Style"" is popular even if few people understand it', 'how Psy gains worldwide success through his talent and hard work', 'what emotions and cultural morals Psy wants to convey with his song']",The text is mainly about   _  .,"""Gangnam Style"" by singer Psy from Korea, is a popular song, but its extraordinary global success is really the result of its music video, which is a great piece of genius.
