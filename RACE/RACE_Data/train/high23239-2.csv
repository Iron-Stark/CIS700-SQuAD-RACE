2,C,"['The traditional stores of a country are forced to fight back.', 'The traditional stores of a country become dependant.', ""They have negative effect on a country's culture."", ""The multi-billion dollar chain can't be matched.""]",What is the trouble with American companies opening chains all over the world?,"French people pride themselves on their delicious foods, such as cheese, baguettes and croissants(two kinds of food). In fact, food is an important part of French culture. Families and friends spend hours over the dinner table each night. It is the opposite of the fast-food habit common in other parts of the West. 
It's the reason why the French are very angry that a McDonald's is opening beneath Paris's most famous museum: the Louvre  . The new restaurant will be the 1,142nd McDonald's in France, and will open in the underground approach to the museum. But many French people can't understand why this American chain is opening in the heart of French culture. 
         However, McDonald's is paying no notice to the complaint. McDonald's now has 31,000 chains worldwide. Tourists are hungry, and opening chains in tourist spots pays well. 
         There is another chain threatening France's heritage. This time it is coffee rather than burgers. As more and more Starbucks open in Paris, traditional French cafes are forced to close. 
         The trouble with American companies opening chains throughout the world is the destructive effect they can have on a country's culture. How can a small, independent coffee shop compete with the multi-billion dollar chain? You can go to a Starbucks in any city in the world, but you can only go to a Parisian cafe in France.
         Responsibility is with the tourists. A McDonald's wouldn't open so near the Louvre if it weren't not going to make money. Similarly, a Pizza Hut wouldn't overlook   Egypt's Great Pyramid if no one wants to sit in it. Maybe next time you visit the Great Wall, you should think twice before ordering a Cappuccino in the Starbucks.",high23239.txt
