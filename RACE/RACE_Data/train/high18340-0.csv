0,D,"['Because these fields usually attract very few students', 'Because science and business are too difficult to learn.', 'Because he thinks they have a poor family background.', 'Because he wants more students to choose these fields .']",Why does Florida governor Rick Scott want to charge science and business students less ?,"Should people who study science and business pay less for college than people who focus on art and history? That may soon be the case at Florida's state universities.
In tough economic times, Florida governor Rick Scott wants to lead college students toward careers that will pay off after graduation. There are more jobs available in Florida in the fields of business, engineering, healthcare, science and technology. So why not encourage students to focus on these ""high-demand"" subjects by charging less tuition for them?
""We assume students go to college because they want to pursue jobs,"" Dale Brill said. He is the head of a group of business people, educators and lawmakers who made the recommendation to the governor to keep tuition low for job-friendly areas of academic study. ""We all share the goal of students getting jobs and being productive citizens. Some majors are more valuable than others.""
Supporters of the plan have their reasons. More students will choose these ""high-demand"" majors and get jobs after graduation. The state will gain an  
educated workforce that is qualified to fill open jobs. Universities that can show that their
graduates are getting jobs will qualify for more funding from the state.
But critics of the plan say it's unfair to load humanities majors--those who study literature, philosophy, history and art--with debt while keeping tuition low for so-called ""high-demand"" majors in business and science. In fact, university professors wrote a letter to Governor Scott arguing that if students majoring in history and other humanities subjects are forced to pay higher tuition, they may simply choose to attend universities in other states.
Still others argue that the plan sets students up for failure. Students should choose majors based on their interests, skills and talents, rather than on what jobs are available at any given time. Those who choose majors because they are interested in a particular field of study will be more successful and satisfied in their careers.",high18340.txt
