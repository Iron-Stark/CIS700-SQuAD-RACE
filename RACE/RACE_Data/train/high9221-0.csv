0,A,"['They were all female.', 'They were all professional.', 'They made the longest expedition.', 'They had been strictly trained.']",What is special about the expedition team?,"I was going to die in Antarctica, I was certain.An image of my frost-covered body, pale and lifeless, filled my mind as I glanced around.In all directions the empty wilderness of Antarctica stretched away from me, the only feature on the landscape was the division between snow and sky.I gazed sadly at my team.They were rapidly disappearing over the horizon.
I was leading an expedition   attempting to reach the south pole.The team was made up of ordinary women from all around the world, from Jamaica, India, Singapore and Cyprus, many of whom had never seen snow, or spent a night in a tent before we set off.Our aim was to be the most international all-female team to reach the South Pole.
As I watched, the rest of the team marched on, unaware that I was not with them.By the time I realized that my sledge was firmly trapped, the team were already a long way ahead of me.I called out to Era, my teammate, "" Era! Stop !""
Getting no response I called again, but my shouts were carried away in the opposite direction by the wind.Seconds passed.Nothing.I was gradually being left alone, completely defenseless against the low temperatures of Antarctica.
My strength increased when I thought of a cold lonely death.I pulled again my sledge, which moved a little. I removed the ice with my ski-pole and boot, desperately trying to break the sledge free.The sledge shot forward, knocking me off balance.I struggled to my feet and set off after the team.
I caught up just as Reena, my teammate from India, looked behind her and noticed there was one person missing.She swung around on her skis in shock and spotted me in the near distance.
As we continued, my panic slowly faded.For the rest of the day, each of the team was glancing over their shoulder every few minutes.They were not going to risk losing me again.",high9221.txt
