I went to an English language school. I was not a beginner, but I was not good at English. At the end of the first term, I could read, write and speak, and I thought I was good at them. However, I was not good at understanding   when people spoke to me. My teacher said,"" Why don't you repeat   the classes?"" I was not happy.
