But he refused, because he had important work to do for his master. He felt sure that all her other friends would come to help her.
She then came to the bull, and hoped that he would _ the hounds with his horns .The bull replied,"" I am very sorry, but I have an appointment with a lady; but I feel sure that our friend , the goat, will do what you want."" The goat, however, feared that his back might do her some harm if he took her upon it, The sheep, she felt sure, was the proper friend to ask for help.
