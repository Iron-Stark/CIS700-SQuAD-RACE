0,D,"['be punished', 'be offered another job', 'put off the training class', 'lose his job']","If the older man did not have the proper clothes, he would   _","My friend Robert started a new job this week and he's been in the training class for two days. The employer has a very strict dress code--dark blue shirts and pants.
On the first day, an older gentleman in his class did not have the proper clothes and he was strictly told that he would be fired if he didn't have the right clothes the next day. He explained, ""Sir, I had not been told about this. Because of my larger size, it's sometimes difficult to find the right clothing for a price I can afford.""
Last night, Robert and I decided that this old man shouldn't lose the chance of work simply because he couldn't afford the clothes. I had some cash on hand and Robert took it with him this morning just in case it was needed.
When training started this morning, the trainer was ready to fire the older gentleman. ""You have 10 minutes to be in proper clothes,"" he was told. At this point, Robert spoke up and asked if he could have 10 minutes to get him the clothes. He then ran out to the store and bought the proper-sized pants and a shirt; he returned with both and gave them to the older man.
The older gentleman began to cry and told him that he couldn't accept such a gift from a stranger. Robert told him he had to because he had lost the receipt  and couldn't return them--a little white lie. The pants were a perfect fit, the shirt was a bit tight but he was able to keep his job.
""My wife and I tried to gather together some money last night, but we didn't have enough to buy the clothes,"" he told Robert. ""It's unbelievable to me that anybody would do such a thing for only knowing me a day!""
More unbelievable is how good it has made Robert and me feel to do this.",high1858.txt
