Pumpkin farm around the town. Jack's pumpkins were famous , for they always had the perfect shape and never rotted (   ) until well after Halloween . Every year around Halloween , people came from all over the town to buy his pumpkins to make their jack-o-lanterns ( )

I have some bad news , Jack ,"" Pete said.
""What is it ? "" Jack asked . a little worried.
The town decided not to have Halloween this year! They said there was simply no reason for it and they didn't have time to celebrate it because many other holidays were coming up soon . Peter told him. He knew this was very bad news for jack.
Jack became very sad and lowered ( ) his head  . ""What can I do now , Peter?"" I have all these beautiful pumpkins and I can't keep them until next Halloween .""
Peter replied, "" Well , there are always pumpkin pies and pumpkin bread for other holidays.""
Jack was worried and said, ""I sell most of my pumpkins for the Halloween . I can only sell a few pumpkins during the rest of the year. And Pete, it's not so much about the money . I live a simple life out here in the country and I don't need much money . But I feel happy every year when thousands of people get my pumpkins and take them and make them into beautiful jack-o-lanterns.
Now all these pumpkins will be useless because people won't make jack-o-lanterns this year. oh, this is very bad news ."" Jack began to weep . large tears ran down his face.",middle6236.txt
