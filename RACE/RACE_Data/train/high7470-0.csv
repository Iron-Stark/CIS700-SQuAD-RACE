0,D,"['8 weeks', '11 hours', '7 hours', '18 hours']",Rebecca Martinez died   _  after she went to the operation table.,"SANTO DOMINGO, Domincan Republic ---An infant girl born with a second head bled to death Saturday after complex surgery   to remove her partially formed twin , her parents and doctors said.
A medical team completed the 11- hour operation Friday night and said 8-week-old Rebecca Martinez died seven hours later. Doctors had warned after the surgery that the girl would be at great risk of death.
"" We knew this was a very risky surgery , and now we accept what God has decided , "" Rebecca's father , 29-year-old Frankin Martinez, said at a news conference with his wife. "" Rebecca is no longer with us physically , but no one will forget her.""
Martinez said the family would bury Rebecca in a private funeral later in the day.
The girl lost a lot of blood in the operation, which apparently ( ) caused her to suffer a heart attack , said Dr. Jorge Lazareff , the lead surgeon . Friends and family donated   almost 4 gallons of blood for surgeons to use Rebeca's operation
""This was not a failure or an error ,"" Lazareff said . "" When we left here last night the girl was in stable condition. At some point in the middle of the night , she started to bleed.""
Rebecca was born Dec. 10 with the undeveloped head of her twin, an exteremely rare condition known as craniopagus parasticus . Rebecca was the eighth documented case in the world of craniopagus parasiticus, doctors said.
All the other infants documented to have had the condition died before birth , making Rebecca\s surgery the first known operation of its kind.
Without an operation , Rebecca would have barely been able to lift her head at 3 months old. Her doctors said the pressure from the second head would have prevented her brain from developing.
"" We always saw Rebecca without the extra part of her body, ""er father said after her death.
Rebecca was their third child-----along with a 4-year-old boy and a 1-year-old girl.",high7470.txt
