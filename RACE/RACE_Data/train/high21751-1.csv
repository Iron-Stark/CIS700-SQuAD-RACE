       *If you leave your bike in a strange place ,put it near something like a big stone or a tree.
Note landmarks on the route as you go away from your bike .When you return ,go back 
along the same route
       *Simplify the way of finding your direction by using lines such as streets in a town,streams ,or walls in the countryside to guide you .Count your steps so that you know how far you have gone and note any landmarks such as tower blocks or hills which can help to find out where you are.
