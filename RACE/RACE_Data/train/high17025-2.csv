The child, Nicole Hobson, was being taken by her mother to Children's Memorial Hospital about 11 P. M., Wednesday to check her recently inserted   pacemaker.
The child was stricken about a mile from the hospital. Her mother, May Hobson, 40, said, ""I told the bus driver that my baby had just had heart operation and that she was having a heart failure. He said he couldn't go through the traffic.""
Ted Garretson, 28, a passenger who had tried to bring back Nicole's life, said the driver did nothing to help and stopped once to pick up more passengers.
When the driver reached a corner where he was to make a turn, a block from the hospital, he told Mrs. Hobson to get off, she said.
A transit spokesman said the driver should have made radio call to the control center for help.",high17025.txt
