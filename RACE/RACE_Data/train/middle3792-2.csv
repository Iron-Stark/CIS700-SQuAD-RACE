He drove a car for Mr. Black, a rich businessman. He worked hard and the shopkeeper liked him. But he couldn't work when he drank too much. Once he almost fell into the river when he drove along the bridge. Mr. Black became angry and was going to send him away. Mr. Smith had a big family and was afraid of it and promised he would stop drinking at once. The man told him to wait to be dealt with.
One Monday morning Mr. Smith came into the office with two badly burnt ears. ""What happened to your ears?"" asked Mr. Black.
""Well, ""said the man,"" I went to watch a football match yesterday while my wife was ironing  clothes. She had put the iron near the telephone before she went to cook supper. Our team lost the game and I felt sorry for it. As soon as I went in the sitting -room, the phone rang and I answered the iron!"" ""And what happened to the other ear?"" ""When I put the iron down on the table, the telephone rang again!""",middle3792.txt
