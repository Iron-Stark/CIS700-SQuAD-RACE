2,C,"['is the most interesting book for children', ""White's only book written for children"", 'is a good book not only for children but also for adults', 'is mainly about how animals get along with each other']",We learn from the passage that Charlitte's Web   _  .,"Charlotte's Web by E.B. White is a children's book.
As the story opens,eight-year-old farm girl Fern Arable stops her father from killing a baby pig who is weaker than his brothers and sisters.The little pig,Wilbur,becomes one of the main characters in the story.Later he will be treated as a friend by Charlotte,a wise and loving spider living on the same farm.Wilbur slowly realizes that the farmer will kill him for his meat in a few months ,and Charlotte decides to help him out.She tries many things to keep Wilbur alive.She writes words in her web describing how wonderful Wilbur is and this makes the farm famous.
White creates a sort of modern animal fable ,in which animals can speak both with each other and with Fern.Also there are many great characters in this book.
The society of animals has many lessons to teach children and adults:friendship,sacrifice ,hope,determination,love,duty,fairness,respect,and many more.
Part of this novel's success is the fact that the author makes a heroine out of a spider,a creature that many people probably dislike.Unlike a lovely little pig or other creatures,a spider is a creature greatly different from humans.White's Charlotte is a truly wonderful character.He tells the story of Charlotte and her friends in a special way.This is a book that no one could ever dislike.It has much to offer to children as well as to older teens and adult readers.",high4938.txt
