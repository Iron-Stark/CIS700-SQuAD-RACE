One day he brought a basket of apples to the rich man's house. On the doorsteps, he met two monkeys dressed like children. They jumped onto the basket to eat the apples and threw some on the ground. The farmer politely took off his hat and asked the monkeys to get off. They obeyed   and the farmer went into the house. He asked to see the rich man. A servant took him to the room where the rich man was sitting.
