0,D,"['hugs Jenny', 'plays a game', 'goes for a walk', 'gives Jenny kisses']",Marley   _   every morning.,"I'm Jenny. Nothing is cuter than my dog, Marley. He sleeps near my bed at night and gives me kisses every morning. He gets sad when I leave for school. But he's always there waiting when I get home., ready to go for a walk or play a game.
On a Christmas Eve , Marley walked with my family to a store. My mum tied him up outside. When we came out of the store, Marley had gone. My mum called the police to report that he had been stolen. We couldn't find him anywhere. I was very sad. It was the worst Christmas Eve ever.
That night, I didn't sleep well. My cat seemed to know I was sad and hugged me to make me feel better. On Christmas morning, I woke up and called for Marley. Then I remembered that he had gone.
Even though it was Christmas, I didn't want presents. I didn't want anything, except my friend.
Then my mum got a phone call. Someone found him! A woman saw a man on the street trying to sell a scared dog. She felt bad for the dog and used her own money(more than $200)to buy him. She took him to a vet . The vet scanned the dog for a microchip .The vet found our phone number in the microchip and called my mum.
I was so excited when I saw Marley. I want to say thanks to that woman. She's my hero. Getting Marley back was the best Christmas present ever.",middle7299.txt
