0,B,"['the 50 yard dash', 'the long jump', 'the long-distance run', 'the high jump']",The author meant to compete in_.,"In high school I joined the girl athletic club. At our first track meet, I entered for the long jump, but was made an alternate for the 50 yard dash. I didn't like it, since I was better at long distance, but they assured me I would never have to run; they just ran out of alternate.
As I walked up to the start line, I saw my Dad on the sidelines. He was watching. Position, ready, set and off went the starting gun. Believe it or not, I closed my eyes and ran like I'd never run before.
I knew I didn't have a chance of winning. But I started to hear cheering and thought for a minute, was it possible? I opened my eyes and to my disappointment, everyone else was crossing the finish line, inches away from each other and I was only half the distance.
That moment felt like days. I felt so stupid. I just wanted to melt into the ground and disappeared. Worse than that, my Dad was watching and then I felt ashamed. I kept running hard as I could, crying all the way towards the finish line. It seemed no one noticed me as I crossed the finish line. I saw my Dad standing there looking at me. I was ashamed to look at him. He walked over to me and said, ""I'm so proud of you."" I was surprised, ""For what? Everyone else finished before I even got halfway. I looked like a fool."" ""Because you didn't give up, not even when you realized what had happened. You gave it your all and finished."" I laughed and cried at the same time.
I find I can face what seems impossible, even alone and afraid, and, that winning does not always come in as you expect. I give my best effort to all I do, win or lose. I don't give up in the middle of anything.",high11195.txt
