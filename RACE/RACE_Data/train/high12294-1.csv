1,A,"['business has a big say in the movie', 'the original story was not suitable for a movie', 'filmmakers are only concerned about making money', 'milk tea is more popular than ice cream']",We can learn from the example of Meteor Shower that  _  .,"If you've ever seen a James Bond movie,you'll know that the hero gets around in a smart Aston Martin car.

Companies pay a film to place their products in the movie. Product placement took off in the West in the 1980s and is now catching on in China. Two Hunan Satellite TV dramas are recent examples:Ugly Wudi and Let's Go Watch the Meteor Shower (<<>> ).
Shampoo, mobile phones, cars and fitness centers-anything can be product-placed.

But when product placement takes over, artistic considerations can take a back seat.
Cai Zhiyong has been product-placing for years. The Beijing-based advertiser admits there is a conflict between art and business. He explains the way one ad works. In If You are the One (<<>> ), the actress Shu Qi plays a flight attendant. The movie contains product placement for airline companies.

In the original story for Meteor Shower, the heroine's mother owned an ice cream shop. But no ice cream company wanted to sponsor   the film. For this reason, the story was changed.
