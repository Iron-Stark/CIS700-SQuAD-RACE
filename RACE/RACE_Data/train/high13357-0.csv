All rides -- Kingdom Quest Laser Ride, Merlin's Apprentice and Lego City Forest Pursuit -- are open during the evening and supervision   on these rides is provided at all times. The Lego Studios 4D Cinema is also open and guests have _ use of the Lego construction play area until 10:00 pm, which means you will have a good time and don't need to share any facilities with other groups.
But at PS35 a head, with a minimum guest list of 30, it's unlikely to be something the average parent could afford, reports Manchester Evening News.
A Legoland spokesman said: ""The sleepover package is aimed at groups such as boys between eight and ten, girls between six and eight and youth groups, however it is open to everyone within the terms of the offer. "" There is a birthday room to use, and in regard to food, snack boxes can be purchased for the additional cost of PS4.50. Guests are also welcome to bring along their own food and drinks, and there are storage facilities where they can be kept.
""Also we do have daytime party packages available, which are PS15 per child midweek and PS18 per child at the weekend. But these packages have a policy of a minimum of nine and a maximum of 21 people, due to room capacity. ""
The spokesman continued, ""Included in the price for these parties is the birthday cake, and children's meal of sandwiches, crisps, fruit juice, fruit and Haribo sweets. All attending adults also get a free hot drink and the birthday child gets a free group photograph.""
Legoland says that the pricing for the sleepover package is based on overall operating costs of opening the centre exclusively for the group.",high13357.txt
