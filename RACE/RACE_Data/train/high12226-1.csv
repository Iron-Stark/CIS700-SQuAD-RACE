1,C,"['Because they are not able to take the exam at home.', ""Because they can't be allowed to take the exams if they don't have computers at home."", ""Because they can't operate computers as well as those who have computers at home."", 'Because they are worried about how neat their work is.']",Why do people think it is unfair to some students without computers at home?,"Scottish pupils recently were part of a new scheme that allowed them to take their exams online. Those examinations provided a glimpse of the future in May when 120 _ in 10 centers in Scotland sat in front of computers to take a multiple-choice online exam. Although candidates were using a computer mouse instead of a pen, in all other ways the exam was the same as normal.
Exam rooms were set out to ensure that only the candidates and the teachers were able to see the individual screens. The online answers were sent directly to a safe area. According to the students at St Ninian's in East Renfrewshire who took an online French exam, it was definitely the most motivated they had ever felt when taking an exam.
""I could go as fast as I wanted to, rather than as slow as everyone else wanted to,"" said one. ""It was better than looking back and forth between the questions,"" said another. One pupil even described it as fun.
Their head teacher, Dorothy Graham, was not so surprised, ""They are so used to doing things on computers that it seems natural for them. The boys liked it because they didn't have to worry about how neat their work was."" The only things that worried her were power cuts and systems' crashing.
It's thought that online exams could be the norm   in about five years. However, last year there were warnings about computerizing exams in England and Wales. It's thought that it could be unfair to some students if they come from homes without access to a computer.",high12226.txt
