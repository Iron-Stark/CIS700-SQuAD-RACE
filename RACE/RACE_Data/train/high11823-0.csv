On Nov.19,a team of students from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in the US awed peers and even scientists by successfully launching a satellite.
The first satellite designed and built by high school students was sent up into space along with a record setting.28 other small ones on a rocket were sent from a NASA center in Virginia,CNN reported.It took the students seven years to build.
The students call their tiny satellite TJ3Sat,which is named after their school.It is just 10x10x12 centimeters and weighs only 0.89 kilograms,according to Orbital Sciences,a company which developed the rocket and supported the students' project.It can be controlled with a smartphone.
Like most satellites,TJ3Sat can send and receive data.The small spacecraft is equipped with a voice synthesizer  ,which can switch text to voice and transmit those sounds back to Earth over radio waves,said Orbital officials.In this case,anyone can give it a try via the project's website (school website) by submitting   a text.The texts that get approved will be sent to the satellite,changed to voice and then broadcast back to Earth via radio waves.
""I can say 'Go Colonials'on our ground station and when it is on the other side of the world,in India,someone can hear'Go Colonials'over the radio,""the team explains on the website.
The satellite will stay in space for at least three months.
School principal Evan Glazer told The Washington Post that the project started in 2006 as an activity in the spare time.Later it became a research project for a select group of seniors.
At a time when American students are busy with SATs,the launch of the satellite shows what diligent teenagers can achieve when allowed to pursue their own curiosities,Glazer said.
""It used to be that kids growing up wanted to be an astronaut,"" Andrew Petro,program executive   for small spacecraft technology at NASA,said in a statement.""I think we might be seeing kids saying what they want to do is build a spacecraft.The idea here is that they really can do that.""",high11823.txt
