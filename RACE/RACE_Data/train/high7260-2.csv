So many pizza chains compete for the attention of tourists in South Beach, but ask a Miami Beach local where to get the best pizza and they'll tell you about Steve's. This is New York-style pizza, handmade with care and good ingredients . New branches of Steve's are opening elsewhere in Miami, all in non-tourist areas.
Opening hours: 11am-3am

This place is 20 miles east of the city, but local folks would probably drive 200 miles to eat here. The food is good, and the scenery is even better. Come early and wander around the grounds of Indian Cliffs Ranch, where you'll see everything from rabbits to buffalo  , then catch the sunset either before or after your meal.
Opening hours: 5pm-10pm

Opening hours: 7am-2pm

Everybody's favorite for fresh fish (some drive in from LA), Walt's packs them in on weekends. You can't make reservations for dinner (though they're accepted for lunch), but it's worth the wait for the tree fire-grilled seafood and steaks in the many-windowed ground floor or upstairs in captain's chairs.
