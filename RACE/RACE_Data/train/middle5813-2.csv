2,C,"['Older people are not as bright as young people.', 'All older people are healthy and strong.', 'Aging does not mean you become unhealthy.', 'Most older people are unhealthy and poor.']","According to the passage, which of the following is true?","How old is ""old""? The answer has changed over the years.Two hundred years ago, you were old at 35.At the beginning of the 20th century, the average   life span  was 45.In 1950,70-year-olds were really old.Today, a healthy 70-year-old person is still thought young.
So, how old is old? The answer is one you've heard many times, from all kinds of people.""You are as old(or young) as you feel."" Your age simply tells you how many years you have lived.Your body tells you how well you've lived.
""Nobody grows old by living a number of years,"" wrote a writer.""People grow old when they don't have their ideals  ."" People should not have the wrong ideals about aging.Sometimes, old minds can be as bright as young minds.Alice Brophy once said, ""It makes me happy who people say.You look young for your age."" What does that mean? You know you can die old at 30 (30) and live young at 80.",middle5813.txt
