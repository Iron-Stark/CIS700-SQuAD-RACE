1,B,"['A diploma can tell whether a person is honest or not.', 'A diploma is the only sign of ability and talent.', 'A diploma is what you get after you finish a course.', 'A diploma means a job.']","What does Shen Ronghua mean by saying ""diploma means this""?","The girl looking for the job turned out to be excellent but she ended up giving her employer a headache when it also turned out that she used an unreal diploma .
In December, a Civil Administration Bureau in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, announced that it needed five new staff members. Some 120 people applied and took the exam. Applicants were required to show proof of a college degree at least.
Mei Jing beat everyone in the test and the interview. When a follow-up check was done, however, her education certificate  was discovered to be an unreal one.
This was a bit of an embarrassment for the employers. A _ one might say. If she were hired because of her excellent performance, she still wouldn't have the qualifications on paper. But, if she were dropped because she didn't meet the education requirements, they would lose a good worker. Tough problem!
While Mei's future hangs in the balance, the public having learned of the case got involved. Some people said the Bureau should employ her, since results are the only important thing. ""After all, ability is more important than a diploma, ""said one office worker.
Others, however, have attacked Mei's dishonesty. They said that morality was, after all, more important than talent, especially in the case of a government position. Mei wasn't honest, so she shouldn't be hired.
But, Shen Ronghua, the head of the Shanghai Public Administration and Human Resources Institute, tries to be a bit more philosophical.
""There is still a sort of  'diploma means this'  prejudice among people,"" Shen explains, ""Many employers regard a diploma as the only sign of ability and talent.""
So, with this in mind, people may pay little attention to whether someone has real ability or not. They turn to chasing a diploma instead. The unreal diploma is the natural product of this thought.
The conclusion? ""China needs a new human resource system. The new system will not define a person only by his or her diploma, "" Shen says.",high15296.txt
