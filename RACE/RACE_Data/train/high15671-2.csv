2,A,"['Crazy Fans of Death Valley.', 'Importance of Death Valley.', 'Beauty of California National Park.', 'The Best Tourist Attraction in North America.']",What would be the best title for the passage?,"Death Valley is the lowest, hottest, driest area in North America. This California National Park has less than 5 cm of rainfall a year and temperature up to 53degC in summer. That's enough to keep Americans away during the hottest months from June to August. But it is the high temperature and terrible heat that draw their most crazy fans, the foreign tourists. From all over the world, they come to the valley floor in cars, carrying maps and water bottles, and fanning themselves with newspapers to keep cool.
About 1.3 million visitors enter the park each year, from June through August. 90% of them are foreigners. They go there to experience the summer heat that gives Death Valley its name. The average high in July is 53.2 degC and the low 30 degC. For August, the average high is 52.2 degC and the low 29.4 degC.
So what do Americans think of the foreign visitors who arrive for the heat, just when locals from the United States try to avoid it? Park manager Brenda Henson says, "" The foreigners want to experience the heat in Death Valley. We think it's crazy.""
In fact, Death Valley is a series of salt flats   225 km long and 6 km to 26 km wide. Birds and animals are largely absent, and only the
plants have some chance of existence in this extreme place.
One tourist from Paris concluded, "" We come to it because we can tell all our friends and family that we've been to the hottest place in the world.""",high15671.txt
