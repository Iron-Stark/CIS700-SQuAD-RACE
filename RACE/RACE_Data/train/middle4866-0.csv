The restaurant is in eastern downtown Beijing. It's the first eat-in-the-dark restaurant in China, and also in Asia. The restaurant is so welcome, since it's open in January at jianwai SOHO in Chaoyang District.
People going there will experience darkness both during the day and the night. The restaurant offers not only a wonderful choice for food, but also a special environment for friends or parties.
Every day, Whale Inside receives at least 50 guests from everywhere around Beijing. About 10 per cent of them are foreigners.
The customers will go to the light to see the menu, and then they have to hand in all mobile phones, watches and other things that can give off light. They then move to the dark world. Waiters will lead them to the dark dining area. Of course, the waiters are all wearing special glasses that can make them see in the dark. Customers cannot see anything including their food or friends. They have to look for their spoons, drinks, and anything else.
Every table may get a ""secret dish "". The guests will have one chance to guess what the dish is made of. Everyone who guesses it correctly can win a prize. ""It is not easy,"" said the manager, ""because without seeing it, only 30 per cent of the guests can get the answer.""",middle4866.txt
