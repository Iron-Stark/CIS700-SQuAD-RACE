0,B,"['""hou\'s it gaun""', '""reeit""', '""eyyup""', '""ahhdu""']",People from North West greet each other by saying   _  .,"If you have seen or heard of the British TV series Downton Abbey, you have probably noticed an ""upstairs-downstairs"" class system in which the noble people are upstairs, worrying what clothes they should wear for dinner and the poor people are downstairs, working hard to make food and tea. So it's not hard to tell that people are divided into different classes. British society has changed a lot since the days of Downton Abbey, but the division still exists and the funny accents do, too.
Nowadays, what divides Britons is the so-called ""North-South divide"". As you make your way north from the south coast of England, the accent begins to change. The posh ""How are you"" in parts of the South becomes ""Ahhdu"" (how do you do) in the Midlands, ""reeit"" (are you all right) in the North West, ""eyyup"" (what's up) in Yorkshire, and ""hou's it gaun"" (how's it going) in Scotland. Besides accents, the economy also changes. The rich southern city of London slowly becomes the North where people general have less money.
So where does the ""South"" stop being the ""South"" and the ""North"" start being the ""North""? Well, depending on where someone comes from in Britain, you'll get a different answer.
""Anywhere above London is 'the North',"" you might hear a Londoner say. Or if you're in Scotland, you might hear, ""Southern softer!"", talking about a person from Lancashire or Yorkshire, who think of themselves as ""hard (tough) Northerners"". ""Anywhere south of Manchester is not northern,"" you might hear a person from Manchester say.
Many stereotypes   have come from the ""North-South Divide"", too. Often, southerners are seen as being rude and snobbish   by northerners. And northerners are often seen as uneducated by southerners.
Today, the career you have and the person you marry don't depend on where you were born or what class you are from. But as London is getting richer and people are moving to the South for work, the North-South divide is getting bigger. Yet for all that divides us, the truth is, we couldn't live without each other!",high8011.txt
