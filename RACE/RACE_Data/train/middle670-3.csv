3,D,"['Water will never be used up.', 'How to find fresh water.', 'Water is everywhere.', 'Shortage of fresh water.']",What's the main idea?,"Many people think that water will never be used up because there are many rivers and lakes. And the rain can make us get enough fresh water. Also, we can dig wells to find fresh water under the ground. In fact, it is wrong and dangerous to think so. In some areas, people fight for fresh water. There is little rain there all year round. Let's look around us. Some factories pour dirty water into rivers. And some people drop litter into rivers. We see polluted water here and there. We must do something to help people understand about preventing water from being polluted. It's never too late if we take action right now.",middle670.txt
