1,C,"['They were told a lie.', 'A wrong decision was made.', 'The truth was the opposite.', ""They didn't believe what they were told.""]","What does the writer mean by saying ""but that didn't seem to be the case""?","One Sunday a few of us decided to take advantage of the first sunny day we'd have for ages to take a trip down to the coast to visit the penguins again. Last time I went down there was a couple of months ago and it was a dull cold day. Sunday couldn't have been more different -- clear skies and sunshine made it feel like summer, although it was still -25degC.
Six of us drove to the coast. It was the first time we'd been off the base on our own without our field assistant, so it had a slightly different feeling -- more like a few friends going to the seaside than an Antarctic field trip! When we reached Windy Creek, we luckily caught sight of quite a few small flying seabirds, which are seldom seen there.
Once on the sea ice we found that some of the more curious penguins had wandered over from the main group to come and check us out. We'd been told that then they were nursing their chicks   and they would be more careful and nervous than last time,
We walked across to the main group which were stretched for a couple of miles along the coast. We sat down for some sandwiches and soon found ourselves surrounded by many curious observers. Without any attackers on land, they were very brave and came within a meter of us to pose   for photos.
Before heading back, we spent a few hours on the sea ice watching the penguins and their chicks, which had grown dramatically   since our last visit. It was such a nice day.",high15896.txt
