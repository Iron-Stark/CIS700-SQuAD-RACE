Gift Giving
I'm going to China, and everyone in my chss is asking me to buy them something. What should I do?
Reply from the Highlights Editors
Your classmates arc probably just excited about your trip. Most likely they don't expect you to buy gifts for everyone. Sending a /cw postcards to the entire class during your trip would be a wonderful way to share your experiences. The pictures on the cards and your words of description will be thi' best gift of all.
Dog Bagging
My dog always begs for food at the dinner table. I really want to feed him, but my mom says I can't. I'm afraid he won't like me anymore. What should I do?

Your dog loves you for many more reasons than just for what you feed him. You can show him that you care about him by playing with him, by petting him and speaking kindly to him. and by making sure he has fresh water. It might be best if your dog is not near the din!ner table while you are eating. You could teach him to stay in another room.
Being BiHngua(> 
My aunt insists that we speak our language (Tagalog) at home and English outside the house. Do you think she is right?

It is a great gift to have someone in your family who is willing to take the time to teach you another language. It's a good way to keep family traditions alive, and it helps to develop your language skills. Your ability to use both English and Tagalog will help you learn a third and fourth language later in life So it sounds like a great idea!",high18558.txt
