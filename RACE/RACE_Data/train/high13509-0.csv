As the Guelph Mercury reported, the 54-year-old biologist, originally from Mississippi, was known for his research and warnings about the extinction of marine life around the world.
He developed a passion for marine protection during his days in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada, where he worked for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans at a time when the industry was watching the collapse   of the cod   fishery. He became, says the Guelph Mercury, a lone, unpopular voice in the discussion about the cause of the collapse, insisting overfishing was the main factor. The world was spending its energy fighting over the few fish left instead of cutting catch limits before it was too late.
He warned governments, the fishing industry and consumers, that unless commercial fishing was reduced, many large marine species would become extinct, leading to economic disruptions, food shortages, and lasting damage to marine ecosystems. He said his conclusions were shocking because people had lost sight of the true effect of the declines and they did not look back far enough in history. In other words, he said, ""We've forgotten how big fish used to be and how many of them once lived in the sea.""",high13509.txt
