1,D,"['Goat meat is healthy food.', 'Immigrants bring different tastes.', 'The industry still leaves room for profit.', 'Raising goats is challenging.']",Which of the following is NOT a factor in making goat meat more popular?,"American farmers are raising five percent more goats for meat these days.
Goat meat is high in protein and lower in unhealthy fat than many other meats.Even so,the industry is small compared to chicken,beef and pork. But immigration has brought more of a taste for goat to America from all over the world.
Experts from the University of Illinois offer some questions for people to consider if they are thinking about raising goats.
First of all,do you understand that there always has to be someone to care for the goats?
*How much land do you have available? And how good is it? Poor ground may support two to four goats on half a hectare.Better grassland can support six to eight. If goats and cattle share the land,two goats can be added for each cow. The goats will eat weeds and other plants that cattle do not like.
*Do you have buildings for the number of female goats you plan to keep during winter? An open,cold,dry barn is better than a closed,warm barn where the air is wet.
*Do you have the equipment to clean barns  and to harvest hay  to feed your goats? Or will you get someone else to do it,or buy the hay?
The experts say a profitable business in goat meat may take three to five years to establish.And, of course, there are no guarantees .",high10899.txt
