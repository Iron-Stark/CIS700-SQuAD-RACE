0,D,"['45 hours', '46 hours', '57 hours', '58 hours']",Jessica stayed in the well at least   _  .,"At a day care center in Texas, children were playing outside. One of the children was Jessica McClure. She was only 18months old. Her mother, worked at the day care center , was watching the children . Suddenly Jessica fell and disappeared. Jessica's mother screamed and ran to her.
A well was in the yard of the center. The well was only eight inches across and a rock always covered it. But children had moved the rock. When Jessica fell, she fell right into the well.
Jessica's mother reached inside the well, but she couldn't feel Jessica. She ran to a phone and dialed 911 for help. Men from the fire department arrived. They discovered that Jessica was about 20 feet down in the well. For the next hour the men talked and planned Jessica's rescue.
""We can't go down into the well, "" they said. ""It is too narrow. So, we're going to drill a tunnel across to Jessica. When we reach her, we'll bring her through the tunnel and up through our hole.""
The men began to drill the hole at 11a.m. on Wednesday, October 14, 1987. The men had a difficult job; they were drilling through solid rock. During her days in the well, Jessica sometimes called her mother, sometimes she slept, sometimes she cried and sometimes she sang.
All over the world, people waited for news of Jessica. Everyone worried about her.
At 8 p.m. on Friday, October 16, men reached Jessica and brought her up from the well. Then paramedics rushed her to the hospital. Jessica was dirty, hungry, thirsty and tired. Her feet and forehead were badly injured. But she was alive.
After Jessica's rescue, one of the rescuers made a metal cover for the well which wrote, ""To Jessica, with love from all of us.""",high9087.txt
