2,D,"['Tai chi is not a common way of exercise in the community in America.', 'More and more people will suffer from depression in the near future.', 'In the near future, tai chi will replace medicine in the treatment of depression.', 'Either tai chi or a health education class does good to elderly people with \ndepression.']",What can be inferred from the passage?,"More than two million Americans above 65 years of age suffer from depression. And in the next 35 years, twice as many people will find themselves in that age range --including me, and probably you too! So, what activities can prevent depression as we get older?
Researchers at UCLA turned to a gentle ""Westernized"" version of tai chi, the 2,000-year-old Chinese martial art  . When a group of adults over 60 on antidepressant drug therapy   attended a weekly tai chi exercise class, standard rating scales showed greater improvement in their level of depression, along with improved quality of life, better memory and cognition  , and more overall energy when compared to study participants taking the same medicine but going to a weekly health education class.
""This is the first study to prove the benefits of tai chi in the management of late-life depression, and we were encouraged by the results,"" said Dr Helen Lavretsky, a UCLA professor. ""We know that nearly two-thirds of elderly patients who seek treatment for their depression fail to achieve relief with a prescribed medication  .""
In the study, 112 adults above 60 with major depression were treated with the prescription antidepressant medicine for approximately four weeks.Among those participants, 73 who showed only little improvement continued to receive the daily medication but were also assigned to 10 weeks of either a tai chi class or a health education class for two hours per week.
""Both groups showed improvement in the severity   of depression,"" said Lavretsky. But greater benefits were noted among those participating in tai chi.
This study shows that adding a mind-body exercise like tai chi, which is widely available in the community, can improve the outcomes of treating depression in older adults.With tai.chi, we may be able to treat other, coexisting medical conditions without exposing them to additional medications.""",high21285.txt
