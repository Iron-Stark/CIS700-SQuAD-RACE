2,D,"['They can play in the game rooms.', 'They can have lots of delicious food.', 'They can go skiing.', 'They can go swimming and fishing and cook food.']",What can they do in the mountains?,"I'm going to have a great weekend. I'll go across Canada with my parents by car. We'll drive seven or eight hours a day.
In Toronto, we'll stay in a big hotel. The food is very delicious. There's a big swimming pool and a lot of game rooms. I think I'll play there happily. But there'll be lots of people in the hotel, so I think we'll sleep in one room. And it's expensive.
Then we are going to stay in a small cabin  in the mountains. I really love it. The cabin is clean and quiet. We'll have two rooms, so I can get up late in the morning. But we have to get up early because we want to go swimming. There is a beautiful lake near the cabin. We also can go fishing and cook food outside.",middle7217.txt
