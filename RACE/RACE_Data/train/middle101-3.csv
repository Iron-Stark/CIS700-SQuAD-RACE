American schools begin in September after a long summer holiday. There are two terms  in a school year. The first term is from September to January, and the second is from February to June. Most American children begin to go to school when they are five years old. Most students are seventeen or eighteen years old when they finish high school.
High school students take only four or five subjects  each term. They usually go to the same classes every day, and they have homework for every class.  After class they do many interesting things.
After high school, many students go to college . They can go to a small one or a large one. They usually have to give a lot of money. So many college students work after class to get the money for their studies.",middle101.txt
