0,C,"['Never.', 'Once a day.', 'Twice a week.', 'Four times a week.']",How often does the writer send e-mails?,"6 June ,Saturday
I read an article about people living in the e-age yesterday .It talks about different ways of communicating like chatting online  ,sending e-mails ,sending different kinds of messages and keeping an online diary .
The article says that people nowadays send e-mails at least once a day .I do not agree with this because I send e-mails only twice a week .However ,I do check my e-mails once a day .I like receiving e-mails.
About chatting online ,the article says that it is becoming more and more popular among teenagers .I think this is true .Whenever I arrive at home ,I turn on my computer and log  on to chat online with my friends .I prefer chatting online to calling a friend .because I can chat with many friends at the same time .But I like using mobile phones. When I don't have my computer with me ,I can send short messages to my friends . I also like keeping in touch  with them in this way .
I keep an online diary four times a week .I like telling others what has happened to me .I think I am one of the people living in the e-age . I can't live without computers or mobile phones .",middle4563.txt
