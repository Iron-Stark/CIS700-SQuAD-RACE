1,D,"['after he read many English texts', 'because he spoke English very slowly', 'even before he went to the high school in Wroclaw', 'because of his English teacher, his friends Wojtek and Michael']",The writer made great progress in learning English   _  .,"I started learning English when I was 6 years old. For 8 years I have learned English in the way everybody else did--by going to English classes. It was useless. I did everything that the teachers told me to do. But I didn't get any results. I mean, I was always one of the best students in class. However, it took me a long time to read English texts. I made lots of mistakes when writing, and my pronunciation was bad, and I could only speak English very slowly. After my eight years of studying hard, these were the results.
In 2003, I went to the best high school in Wroclaw. It was a special school with a lot of English classes. I owe  a lot to the people I met there, both students and teachers. My first two years in high school were very important for my English. My English teacher, Mr Janusz Laskosz, gave me a lot of good advice, especially on pronunciation and vocabulary. My talented friends, Wojtek and Michael Ryszard, who are my partners now, were both fantastic English learners. What's more, every time I heard them speak, they seemed to have a bigger vocabulary . I wanted to be as good as them, so I studied harder. And my English improved. Wojtek and Michael also introduced me to SuperMemo, which has been very important in my life. And, of course, I could discuss the English language with them, which was a great thing.",middle4746.txt
