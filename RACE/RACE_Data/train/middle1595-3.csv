One evening in Los Angeles, someone rang the bell of a house. It was a dangerous area at night, so the _ of the house took his gun with him when he answered the door. He opened the door and saw a strange man. But the man turned round and started walking away from the house. The owner cried: ""Freeze"", but the young man went on walking without obeying the owner's order. The owner thought he was trying to run away, so he shot at the young man and he was killed.
Later, police found that the dead man was a Japanese student who was studying in Los Angeles University. He went to visit a friend, but unluckily could not remember the number of the house. When he realized he went to the wrong house he turned round and left. He didn't know much English and so didn't understand the word ""Freeze"". What a lesson we should get for this!",middle1595.txt
