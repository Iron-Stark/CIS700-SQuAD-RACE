3,B,"['read more books', 'be better readers', 'fit our speed to our needs', 'change our speed of reading now and then']",In this passage the author advises us to   _  .,"If you want to become a better reader, here are four important points to remember about rate or speed of reading:
First, knowing why you are reading and what you are reading to find out will often help you to know whether to read rapidly or slowly.
Second, some things should be read slowly. Examples are directions for making or doing something; arithmetic problems, science and history books. They are full of important information. You must read such things slowly to remember each important step and understand each idea.
Third, some things should be read rapidly. Examples are simple stories for enjoyment, news, letters from friends, items or bits of news from local or hometown paper, telling what is happening to friends and neighbors.
Fourth, in some of your readings, you must change your speed from fast to slow, and slow to fast, as you read. You'll need to read certain pages rapidly and then slow down and do more careful reading when you come to important ideas which should be remembered.",middle1553.txt
