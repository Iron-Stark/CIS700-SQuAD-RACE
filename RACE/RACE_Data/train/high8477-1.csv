1,B,"['It has a large car park.', 'It is not far away from the coast.', 'It sells cars and insurance.', 'It can stand a storm.']",What can we learn about the motel from the passage?,"Jasmine Meyers had the last laugh when the ocean swallowed her SUV Monday morning and brought it up an hour later, damaged, on the beach. Meyers was staying in Campbell River's Eagles Nest Motel during the wild storm that attacked the east coast of Vancouver Island early this week.
""We woke up to my mom screaming 'Your car! Your car! Your car's about to go in the water,'""she said Wednesday.
She'd parked her car in the hotel's parking lot that she described as a sort of a sea wall.
The storm that swept throughout coastal areas hit extra hard in the Campbell River area.
At about 8:30 am the bank below the parking lot gave way. Huge waves caught hold of the Toyota and took it into the water.
Her mother took pictures while the terrible waves pulled the car out to sea. Then Meyers and her family members could only watch helplessly as the car was struck and pushed around in front of the hotel.
""It floated around out there for about an hour.""
Then the ocean spit the car back up on the beach. Meyers said it sat there until Wednesday, when a tow truck finally recovered the destroyed car.
That's the crazy part of the story. The fun part is what happened next.
""I went mad,"" said Meyers. ""I didn't cry because I knew that I had insurance, but I went mad and I didn't know what to do.""
Yeah, insurance: not just insurance, but replacement insurance.
""Replacement insurance only ever lasts for three years,""said Meyers. ""Mine ends on Nov.22 I would have been crying if it had been 10 days later.""",high8477.txt
