3,B,"['The old Titanic', 'The blueprints of TitanicII', 'The unsinkable TitanicII', 'Clive Palmer--a billionaire']",What's the best title of the passage?,"NEW YORK--Australian mining enterpriser Clive Palmer on Tuesday unveiled  blueprints   for Titanic II, a modern copy of the doomed ocean liner, although he didn't call the ship unsinkable any more.
The ship will largely recreate the design and decoration of the fabled original, with some modifications to keep it in line with current safety rules and shipbuilding practices, and the addition of some modern comforts such as air conditioning, Palmer said at a press conference in New York.
The three passenger classes, however, will be prevented from mingling , as in 1912, Palmer said. ""I'm not too superstitious . ""Palmer said when asked whether recreating a ship best-known for sinking was tempting fate.
White Star Line, the operator of the original ship, had said the Titanic was designed to be unsinkable. About 1, 500 people died on Titanic's _ voyage in 1912 from Southampton to New York after the ship collided with an iceberg in the North Atlantic.
Palmer, who created the company Blue Star Line last year, refused to make a similar boast.
""Anything will sink if you put a hole in it,""Palmer said. ""I think it would be very cavalier  to say it.""
Unlike the original, TitanicII will have more than enough space in its lifeboats for every person on board and will have additional escape staircases. Markku Kanerva, sales director at Deltamarin, the Finnish company designing the ship, said it would be ""the safest cruise ship in the world"".
Palmer refused to answer questions about the project's cost. Although the Titanic was the world's largest ship in her time, she would be smaller than many of today's modern cruise ships.
""It's not about the money, ""Palmer said. ""I've got enough money for it. I think that's all that matters.""
Forbes estimated Palmer's net worth to be $795 million in 2012. He describes himself as a billionaire.
TitanicII will be built by Chinese state-owned CSC Jinling Shipyard, which has already built four ore carriers for Palmer's mining business, he said. The contract to build TitanicII has not yet been signed, Palmer said.",high14929.txt
