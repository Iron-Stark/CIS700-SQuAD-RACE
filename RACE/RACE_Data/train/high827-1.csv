Some British scientists have recently solved this mystery.
It turns out that roots have special hairs that tie them into the soil and help them grow their way past obstacles, a team at the John Inners Center in Norwich reports in the February 29 issue of Journal Science.
""The key is in the fuzzy coat of hairs on the roots of plants,"" says professor Liam Dolan. ""We have found a growth control system that enables these hairs to find their way and to become longer when their path is clear.""
Root hairs explore the soil in much the same way a person would feel their way in the dark. If they come across an obstacle, they make their way around until they can continue growing in an opening. In the meantime, the plant is held in place as the hairs grip the soil.
The hairs are guided by a clever chemical trick. A protein  at the tip of the root hairs called RHD2 helps them to take calcium  from the soil. Calcium makes the hairs grow, and produce more RHD2, and take more calcium.
But when an obstacle blocks the hair's path, or the hair reaches the surface of the soil, the cycle is broken and growth starts in another direction.
This system gives plants the flexibility to explore a complex environment and to live in even the most unpromising soils, says Dolan.
In poor soils such as in parts of Australia and Africa, native plants have adapted by producing enormous numbers of root hairs. A better understanding of this adaptation will allow scientists to develop hairy rooted crops that can grow in unfriendly environments.
According to Dolan, ""Research in the John Inners Center is taking a breeding approach to increase hair length in wheat but it will be some time before new cultivars  are developed.""",high827.txt
