3,D,"['A typical English breakfast is eggs, bread, bacon and milk.', 'The writer would like to have breakfast at the restaurant better.', ""Chicken and banana pie are the writer's favourite food."", 'The menu often changes and there is always something different.']",What can we know from the passage?,"My favourite restaurant is called 'Annablella's cafe'. It is a small restaurant serving  Western food. It is in a city called Bristol. It is difficult to find because it is behind a very tall building. Only local people eat at this restaurant, and visitors can never find it! I think the food at the restaurant is the best in the whole country.
I like to go to this restaurant every two weeks. The waiters know me very well now. They are my friends. They know what my favourite drink is, so when I arrive, there is always a bottle of coke on the table. The menu changes every week so there is always something different to eat. My favourite meat is chicken, so I always order something with chicken in it. For dessert , I usually have apple pie with custard or chocolate cake. Delicious!
Sometimes I go to this restaurant for breakfast. I have a typical  English breakfast: eggs, bacon, sausages, tomatoes and bread. The breakfast is delicious, but I like to eat at this restaurant at dinnertime better.",middle4914.txt
