2,C,"['He is smart and humorous.', 'He does everything well except study.', 'He gets on well with Xiao Xue.', 'He is good at computer and creative.']",Which of the following is NOT the advantage of Liu Xing according to the passage?,"If you are a TV addict, you can't have missed the popular sitcom  Home With Kids. The lead characters, 17-year-old Xiao Xue and 14-year-old Liu Xing can remind us of our own behavior or our classmates. We love the two teenagers, but are they good students? And what makes a good student?
""Being a student is a kind of occupation, so a good student should have good grades. Based on their school reports, clever and diligent, Xiao Xue is a much better student than her brother, Liu Xing,"" says Wu Hao, 16, Chifeng in Inner Mongolia. ""The boy should work harder at studying since our duty as students is to study well.""

""Honesty and kindness make you admirable. But Xiao Xue can be selfish, dishonest and arrogant, which make others feel uncomfortable to be around her. So she has a lot yet to improve on,"" Wu said.
Many teenagers do not think it is fair to judge students by their grades. Take Liu Xing for example. He is bright, good at computers and does everything else well like any other 14-year-old student except studying.
""He is smart, humorous and always has fancy ideas which makes him popular. I guess he could be an excellent student if he attended school in the United States, where high grades are not so important and creativity is hailed,"" says Jia Xiaoxu, 17, Hefei, Anhui.
From the US hit movie High School Musical, Jia discovers her role model.
