3,C,"['Jack was very angry when he had a quarrel with James.', 'They decided to get some water after they found an oasis.', 'The two good friends went on walking after the quarrel and found an oasis a few days later.', 'Hatred can only bring you unhappiness.']",Which of the statements is NOT true according to the passage?,"Once upon a time,there were two good friends.One was called Jack and the other was called James.One day,the two friends were walking through the desert.During the journey they had a quarrel,and Jack couldn't control himself and hit James in the face.James felt hurt,but he didn't say anything.Instead,he wrote in the sand,""Today my best friend Jack hit me in the face.""
They kept on walking until they found an oasis .They decided to get some water there.Suddenly James had trouble in the water,he fell into the mire and was in danger.Jack saved him at once.When he felt all right,he wrote on a stone,""Today my best friend Jack saved my life.""Jack was very surprised and asked James,""After I hurt you,you wrote in the sand and now you write on the stone.Why?""James replied,""When someone hurts us,we should write it down in the sand so that the wind of forgiveness can blow it away.But when someone does anything good for us,we must write it on the stone,so no wind can blow it away.""
Since then,the two good friends have never quarreled with each other again and they got on better with each other.
Hatred can bring you nothing but unhappiness.If you don't forgive others,you are making trouble for yourself Keep a peaceful heart all the time and remember to be always thankful to others!",middle1625.txt
