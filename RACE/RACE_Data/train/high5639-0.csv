Day Camp includes six adventurous days of rock climbing, hiking, swimming, and canoeing in beautiful Bear Valley. Our focus is climbing but we use additional activities to keep things lively. Instructions and skill development are provided. No experience is required and all equipment is provided. On the last day parents are welcome to join us for a big lunch to hear all about the adventures of camp for nothing.
Overnight campers can get the full experience with family-style meals, evening activities and top accommodations   at the BaseCamp Lodge in Bear Valley. A typical schedule is that after Day Camp, campers get a short rest and snack before getting together for a hike or swim. Afterwards, a delicious meal is served as tales from the day are shared around the table.
