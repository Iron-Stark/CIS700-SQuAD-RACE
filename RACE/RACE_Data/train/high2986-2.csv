2,C,"['use her middle name', ""use her husband's first name"", 'ask her which name she likes', 'change the order of her names']","To address a married woman properly, you'd better   _   .","When former American President Bill Clinton traveled to South Korea to visit President Kim Young Sam, he repeatedly referred to the Korean president's wife as Mrs. Kim. By mistake, President Clinton's advisers thought that Koreans have the same naming customs as the Japanese. Clinton had not been told that, in Korea, wives keep their family names. President Kim Young Sam's wife was named Sohm Myong Suk. Therefore, she should be addressed   as Mrs. Sohm.
President Clinton arrived in Korea directly after leaving Japan and had not changed his culture _ . His failure to follow Korean customs gave the impression that Korea was not as important to him as Japan.
In addition to Koreans some Asian husbands and wives do not share the same family names. This practice often puzzles English-speaking teachers when talking with a pupil's parents. They become puzzled about the student's correct last name. Placing the family name first is common among a number of Asian cultures.
Mexican naming customs are different as well. When a woman marries, she keeps her family name and adds her husband's name after the word ""de"", which means ""of"". This affects how they fill in forms in the United States. When requested to fill in a middle name, they generally write the father's family name. But Mexicans are addressed by the family name of the mother. This often causes puzzlement.
Here are a few ways to deal with such difficult situations: don't always think that a married woman uses her husband's last name. Remember that in many Asian cultures, the order of first and last names is reversed  . Ask which name a person would prefer to use. If the name is difficult to pronounce, admit it, and ask the person to help you say it correctly.",high2986.txt
