1,A,"['Teachers.', 'Family.', 'Facebook and MSN.', 'Friends.']",Which of the following is NOT among the three most important things for girls?,"National Family Week-an event that encourages families to spend more time together-carried out a study among 8-15 yearolds.The study found 40% of girls thought Facebook was one of the most important things in their lives-compared with 6% of boys.Parents were found to underestimate   the importance of Internet technology.
The role of social networking was particularly important in families with a single mother as parent.The survey was carried out last month and based on 3,000 parents and 1,000 children across the UK.
The survey shows that girls are using social networking as something central to their social and family life.Girls saw websites such as Facebook as much more influential   than television,magazines, famous people and even their own brothers and sisters.Asked to name the three most important things in their lives, the most popular choices for girls were friends, family and then Facebook and MSN.
Girls are also more likely to believe that technology-in the form of social networking and mobile phones-plays an important role in their lives.While 41% of girls think technology is one of their biggest influences,only 17% of boys believe this.
Girls see their big influences as parents,teachers and technology,while boys choose parents,friends and school as their big influences.The survey says that parents have failed to keep up with their children's use of technology,overestimating     their own importance in their children's lives.
The survey also looked at how children thought about their relationships with their parents.It found that both boys and girls would much rather have stories read to them by their mothers.However,girls felt closer to their fathers,while boys felt closer to their mothers.",high15555.txt
