Past""newcomer""experiences had been difficult, so I was
very anxious to fit in.
Lunchtime was a pleasant surprise when the girls all crowded around my table. Their chat was friendly, so
I began to relax. My new classmates filled me in on the school, the teachers and the other kids. it wasn't long
before the class herd was pointed out to me: Mary Lou. Actually she called herself Mary Louise. A
formal, overmodest young girl with old-fashioned clothes, she wasn't ugly--not even funny looking. Practical
shoes, long wool skirt and a blouse completed the image of a complete herd. The girls' whispers got louder and
louder. Mary Lou didn't notice this. After school, the girls invited me to join them in front of the school.
Arms wrapped around her backpack, Mary Lou came down the school steps. The _ began--rude,
biting comments and disrespectful words from the girls. I paused, then joined right in. My force began to pick
up as I approached her, mean remarks falling from my lips. I even pulled the belt of her backpack and then
pushed her. The belt broke, Mary Lou fell. Everyone was laughing and patting me. I fit in. But I was not proud.
Something inside me hurt.
Mary Lou got up, gathered her books and--without a tear shed--off, she went. She held her head high as a
small trickle of blood ran down from her injured knee.
I turned to leave with my laughing friends and noticed a man standing beside his car. His skin, dark hair
and handsome features told me this was her father. Respectful of Mary Lou's proud spirit, he remained still and
watched the lonely girl walk toward him. Only his eyes--shining with both grief and pride--followed. As I
passed, he looked at me in silence with burning tears that spoke to my shame and scolded my heart. He didn't
speak a word.
No scolding from a teacher or a parent could linger as much as that hurt in my heart from the day a
father's eyes taught me kindness and strength and dignity. I never again joined the cruel herds. I never
again hurt someone for my own gain.",high15333.txt
