Dear Mr. Price, 
I have eaten in your restaurant many times and have always been happy with the food and service. This makes what happened last Saturday even more disappointing. 
It was my son's birthday so we booked a no-smoking table at your restaurant for 7:30 p.m. We arrived on time but were told that our table was not yet ready. At 8:00 p.m., we were given a table in the smoking section. I asked to move but I was told that there were no other tables. A lot of people were smoking so it was uncomfortable and unhealthy. 
Our first waitress, Janet, was very polite and helpful. She gave us free drinks for waiting so long. Our food also came quickly and looked fresh and tasty. When my wife had eaten most of her meal, she found a dead cockroach   in her vegetables. She was shocked and wanted to leave. At first, the waitress told us it was a piece of garlic . When we told her that garlic does not have legs, she apologized and took the food away. 
We asked for the bill, expecting not to pay for my wife's meal. Nobody came. After 15 minutes, I asked to see the manager. The head waiter told us that you were on holiday. I complained again about the horrible cockroach. He told me Janet had finished work. He didn't believe my story and gave me a bill for three meals. I argued with him but was forced to pay. 
The waitress, Janet, was always friendly, but I would like an apology from your impolite head waiter and a full refund   for our meal. It cost $68. Until then, I will not be eating at your restaurant or recommending it to anyone. 
You can contact me at 742-3254 or through e-mail if you want more information. 
Thank you for your attention. 
Yours sincerely,
