2,B,"['What problems the radiation causes.', 'How to avoid bad conditions on Mars.', 'How to build homes on Mars.', 'How to protect Mars.']",What does Para. 4 mainly talk about?,"FOR people who are interested in space, nothing is more exciting than the idea of living on other planets. That might be why the movie The Martian (<<>> ) is so popular. It shows an astronaut struggling to live on Mars. But would it actually be possible to live on the Red Planet?
While the idea of living on Mars is great, the reality does not look as good. Mars does not have a friendly atmosphere for humans. There is very little oxygen there. And because of its distance from the sun, it is also very cold. The temperature on Mars can be -62 degrees on average. This is much too cold for humans.
However, scientists say it might be possible to live there even without a good atmosphere. Daytime on Mars is almost the same as Earth's. It means there's enough sunlight to grow plants inside safe buildings. However, they would have to grow in soil from Earth. Mars does not have a strong enough atmosphere to stop the radiation coming from space, which makes it dangerous to grow things in the soil.
The radiation is also bad for our health. If we want to live there healthily, we need to build our homes under the ground or within the rocks on the planet. This would protect humans from the radiation and also some heat.
When could we actually live on Mars? NASA is hoping to make some progress within the next 20 years.",middle7615.txt
