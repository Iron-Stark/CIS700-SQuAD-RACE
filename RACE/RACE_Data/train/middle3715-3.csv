3,B,"['Chinese', 'Canadian', 'German', 'Japanese']",A   _   man changed Mr. Judson's invention and made it better.,Mr. Whitcomb Judson was a really clever man. He invented a special train that was pushed along by air and in 1893 he invented something like a zip  that could be used to open and close clothes. It could be used on men's trousers and on ladies' dresses. He did not call his invention a 'zip' but everybody says that he was the 'Father of the Zip'. Mr. Judson tried to sell his invention but no one wanted it because it did not work very well. A Canadian changed Mr. Judson's invention and made it better. He made a zip that worked very well in 1913.This is the same zip we use today.,middle3715.txt
