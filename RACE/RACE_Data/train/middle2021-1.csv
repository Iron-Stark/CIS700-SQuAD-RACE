1,C,"['A tape player.', 'A computer game', 'Some tapes', 'Some books']",What is on the computer?,"Dear Eric,
How are you? This is a picture of my room. You can see a nice computer on my desk. It is my birthday present  from my uncle. A tape player is next to   the computer, and some tapes are on the computer. My school-bag is on the chair. My pencil-box and two books are in the schoolbag. And you can see a set of keys in the schoolbag, too. My bed is blue, and my green quilt is on it. Under the bed, you can see a baseball, and I can play it well. My books are in the bookcase, and my white model plane is in it, too. My room is tidy, isn't it?
Do you have a room? Can I have a picture of your room?
Yours,
