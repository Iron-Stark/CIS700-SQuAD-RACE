2,A,"['might help in digestion', 'might make people who drank it throw up', 'tasted good to anybody', 'was welcomed by the whole family']","To the author, the drink made of sprouted wheat   _  .","I'm glad to find this comment which has some sort of support in this quest I have to eat raw foods. I'm an unhealthy 49 years old and have come to the conclusion that it's now or never, so I am taking a dive into the raw eating lifestyle.
I have to cook for my family and prepare what they want to eat. I'm trying to plan out this better so I have some of these unusual foods ready for myself.
I've read several books written by Ann Wigmore and like her approach to the living foods.
Last week I attempted fasting and failed. I lasted five days by having carrots, spinach, apples and other vegetarian diets I could get my hands on. I was doing fine until I drank some coffee. I kind of proved it in my mind to have the coffee but it only made me excited and then I couldn't sleep well and felt hungry and weak. So I stopped and went back to the old way of eating with the family.
This week I started to make a drink called rejuvelac made of sprouted wheat . This is fairly new to do for me and the drink smelled sort of musty and tasted kind of like a musty lemon. The kids tasted it and almost threw up but surprisingly it tasted good to me. It is supposed to help in digestion .
I've made some attempts to grow wheat grass. I think I have figured that out as long as I keep it away from birds and our horses. I have two habits to get rid of, drinking coffee and smoking. I quit smoking last month but something happened, so I started up again. I'm very frustrated  with the smoking and really have a desire to quit for good. Anyhow I will keep this updated on my progress.",high4168.txt
