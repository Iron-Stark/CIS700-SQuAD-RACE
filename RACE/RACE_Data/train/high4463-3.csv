At the gathering, a man called Douglas was repeatedly talking about Lincoln's low position in life and saying that he first met Lincoln when he was a shop assistant at a village shop. Finally he said, ""And Mr. Lincoln was a very good waiter too.""

""Gentlemen, what Mr. Douglas has said is true. I did keep a grocery , and I did sell cotton, candles and cigars, and sometimes whiskey . But I remember that in those days Mr. Douglas was one of my best customers. I often stood on one side of the counter  and sold whiskey to Mr. Douglas on the other side, but the difference between us now is: I have left my side of the counter, but Mr. Douglas still sticks to his as firmly as ever.""",high4463.txt
