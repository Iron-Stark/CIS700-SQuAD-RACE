I began studying this question and answers are interesting.
One morning, I got into three different taxis and announced,""Well,it's my first day back in New York in seven years.I've been in prison.""Not a single driver replied,so I tried again.""Yeah,I shot a man in Reno.""I explained, hoping the driver would ask me why, but nobody asked.The only response came from a Ghanaian driver,""Reno? That is in Nevada?""
Taxi drivers were uniform sympathetic when I said I'd just been fired.""This is America,""a Haitian driver said.""One door is closed.Another is open.""He argued against my plan to burn down my boss' s house.A Pakistani driver even turned down a chance to profit from my loss of hope;he refused to take me to the middle of the George Washington Bridge--a $20 trip.""Why do you want to go there? Go home and relax.Don't worry.Take a new job.""
One very hot weekday in July, while wearing a red ski mask and holding a stuffed pillowcase with the word ""BANK"" on it, I tried calling a taxi five times outside different banks.The driver picked me up every time.My ride with a Haitian driver was typical of the superb assistance I received.

""$25,000?"" he asked.
""Yeah,you think it was wrong to take it?""
""No, man.I work 8 hours and I don't make almost $70.If I can do that,I will do it too.""
As we approached 86th and Lexington, I pointed to the Chemical Bank.
""Hey,there is another bank,""I said,""Could you wait here a minute while I go inside?""
""No,I can't wait.Pay me now."" His unwillingness may have had something to do with money--taxi drivers think the rate for waiting time is too low--but I think he wanted me to learn that even a bank robber can't expect unconditional support.",high5832.txt
