Dear students,
We have some interesting and fun things for you this term. On September 9th 2014, we have a School Open Day. It begins at 9:00 a.m. and finishes at 4:00 p.m. All parents can come to our school, have a cup of coffee, and meet our teachers and other parents.
Your parents can go to your children's classrooms, have a talk with the principal  , have a look at the clubs and ask any questions. From 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m, the parents can go to Room 106 for lunch. If you have any questions about the School Open Day, you can call John Smith --- the principal. The telephone number is 021-4899688.
Welcome to our school and join us.
