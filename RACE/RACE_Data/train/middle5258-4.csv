4,C,"['Because the writer thinks tigers need to eat food.', 'Because the writer thinks tigers are dangerous.', 'Because the writer thinks tigers need to be free.', 'Because the writer thinks tigers are very happy.']",Why does the writer feel sorry for the tigers in cages?,"There is a zoo named Zhongshan in our city. There are many animals. Some animals are very friendly. But some other animals are not. Tigers, lions and some snakes are dangerous . That's why they must be in cages . But I don't think it's good for animals to be in cages. They need to be free. The animals in cages cannot be happy.
Tigers usually live in forests and mountains . They are strong and can run very fast . They run after and eat small animals like rabbits and deer , but now they are in small cages. They have nothing to do every day. So they walk around in the cages, and they want to come out. When they are tired, they sleep. I am kind of sorry for them.",middle5258.txt
