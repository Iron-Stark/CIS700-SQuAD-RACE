3,B,"['People tend to laugh at others rather than themselves.', 'Laughing at yourself can make others free from stress.', ""People can't avoid offending others with gallows humor."", ""People who laugh at themselves are easy to gain others' permission.""]",What can we infer from the passage?,"Gallows humor  may seem like a mistake, or at least in poor taste. But psychologists say that gallows humor can be an important way to relieve stress.""Humor makes you feel in control and it can give you that feeling that everything is okay even when it's not,""says James M.Jones, a psychology professor at the University of Delaware.
Psychologists say that just because you're laughing doesn't mean you're wasting time. Occasional tease among colleagues, particularly if it is associated with the job, can inspire creativity, departmental cohesiveness  and performance.
""There are a lot of stresses out there,""says Ed Dunkelblau, a psychologist in Chicago.""Gallows humor is a way of making difficult things a little less difficult.""
This is as long as the humor is used for the right purpose. The main point of it should be inspiring people--not laughing at them. ""Anything that would lift morale  in terms of the company would be good humor,""says Thierry Guedj, a professor.
You want to give your employees and co-workers a sense of belonging, so don't make observations that are aggressive. Most obviously, Dr. Guedj says, don't make comments about people's physical appearance or faith. If you have any doubt about its appropriateness, don't go through with it.
Or you can take aim at the person that you know won't be offended : yourself. ""If there's going to be a joke or story, it should be you,""Mr Dunkelblau says.
""People with the ability to laugh at themselves can give other people permission to laugh at themselves, too,""Mr Jones says.""And if you can laugh at yourself, you feel better about yourself.""",high1513.txt
