2,D,"['a two bed-room apartment', 'to ask Alan for help', 'to have his own space', 'a place with convenient traffic']","Victor doesn't have a car, so he wants  _  .","Dear Alan,
Guess what? I have a chance to choose my new place to live in! I'm excited and a little nervous. Could you please give me some help?
I'm not sure whether I will live in a house or in an apartment. On the one hand, a house will be too big for just one person, so maybe I should rent an apartment. On the other hand, if I rent  a house, I could find someone else to share with me. The only problem is that a house full of people might be too noisy for me. I prefer to have my own space. The city has some nice apartments, but they are also too expensive. However, if I could find a two-bedroom apartment and get a roommate, that would make it more affordable .I just need to search for a roommate who is neat and quiet. You know I can't live with someone who is loud and messy. I don't have a car, so I also need to think carefully about the location. I probably need to look for somewhere near a bus stop or an underground station. That way I will have more time to study and spend less time traveling.
I'm looking forward to your reply.
Love,
Victor",middle7596.txt
