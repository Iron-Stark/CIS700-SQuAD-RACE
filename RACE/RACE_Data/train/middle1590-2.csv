2,D,"['happy', 'good', 'afraid', 'sad']",The poor farmer felt   _   when he saw the great man,"One day a poor farmer was taking a bag of wheat to town. Suddenly the bag fell off his horse onto the road. He did not know what he could do about it because it was too heavy for him to lift by himself. He only hoped that someone would soon pass by and lend him a hand.
Just at his moment, a man riding a horse came up to him. But the farmer felt disappointed when he saw who he was. It was the great man who lived nearby. He thought the great man wouldn't help him, and hoped another farmer would come up. But to his surprise, the great man got off his horse as soon as he came near, ""I see you need help,"" he said, ""I'm here just at the right time. "" Then he took one end of the bag and the farmer took the other, They lifed it together and put it on the horse.
""Sir,"" asked the farmer, ""how can I pay you?""
""It's quite easy,"" the great man answered, ""when you see anyone else in trouble, do the same for him. """,middle1590.txt
