4,C,"['A friend in need is a friend indeed.', 'Where there is a will, there is a way.', ""Expend the respect of the aged in one's family to that of other families."", 'A fall into the pit, a gain in your wit.']",Which of the following sentences can be the main idea of the passage?,"Just two weeks ago, I was about to cross a busy road when I noticed an old grandpa with a heavy load on his head just a few meters from me. He looked very weak. A few minutes later, I realized I'd forgotten to cross the road. And he'd seen me looking at him. 
   I love my grandparents so much that whenever I see any old people I won't forget to smile at them. I couldn't let go of this grandpa, either. He came near me and handed me a note on which there was an address. I showed him the directions and said he would need a taxi as it was 3 pm on a hot summer's day. Anybody would faint dead in this weather and I didn't want him to walk all the way. But he looked disappointed.
   I asked where he had come from. He replied weakly that he was from Chidambaram, about 240 kilometers from where we were. I was shocked because he looked like he could not even take 2 steps without falling. I called a taxi immediately and asked the driver to drop him at his place. The grandpa wasn't ready because he had no money. I paid for his journey and asked the driver to drop him off safely.
When I turned to look at the grandpa, who was leaving, tears filled my eyes and I didn't want to leave. Memories of my grandparents flashed in my mind, making me feel like crying. I said goodbye to the grandpa, and some happy tears dropped from his eyes.",high21911.txt
