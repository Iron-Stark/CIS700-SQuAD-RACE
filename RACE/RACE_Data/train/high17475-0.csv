Students from the school were joined by pupils from two other schools--Parktown High School for Girls and Impala Crescent Primary School--and went live  at 14:00 local time on 3 February, 2010. BBC producers Ros Smith and Kate Riley were invited to work with the schools.
After deciding on their news topics, the students gathered vox pops from fellow students and their teachers.
Tiffany said, ""We had a chance to talk to other kids from other schools. This was great because Randfontein is a place which is not known to many people and away from modern civilization."" Nomakhosi added, ""Interviewing our teachers and classmates was interesting and I felt important while doing this.""
Chene commented, ""My voice sounded like a whole new person. It takes some time to get used to hearing your own voice.""
Pupils, known as learners in South Africa, then worked with School Report producer Ros Smith to edit their audio  material while others started script-writhing .
With the 14:00 deadline fast approaching, and the audio edited, the new School Reporters recorded their scripts so they could be added to the bulletin.
Ros Smith was really impressed with the students' work. She said, ""The stories they chose were an excellent mix. The final bulletin sounds really good, and they finished with 10 minutes to spare before the deadline.""
On 26 March students from the three schools took part in the School Report News Day with support from the Open Learning Systems Education Trust, and it was a big success.",high17475.txt
