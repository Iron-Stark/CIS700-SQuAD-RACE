Stay away from religious/ strong political beliefsks5u
While you may firmly believe in something, beginning conversations and making small talk about your own personal beliefs may  _ end the conversation. Keep it light, and don't try to convince the other person that you have the ""correct"" information about a higher being, political system or other belief system.
