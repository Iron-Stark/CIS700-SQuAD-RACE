1,D,"['He was a nice and clever man.', 'He liked to work very hard.', 'He was good at driving', 'He was not an honest person.']",What do you think of the car driver?  _,"It was a dark and cold night. The car driver didn't have even one passenger all day. When he went by the railway station, he saw a young man coming out with two bags in his hands. So he quickly opened the door of the car and asked, ""Where do you want to go, sir?""
""To the Star Hotel,"" the young man answered. When the car driver heard that, he didn't feel happy. The young man would give him only three dollars because the hotel was not far from the railway station. But suddenly, he had an idea. He took the passenger through many streets of the big city.
After a long time, the car finally arrived at the hotel. ""You should pay me fifteen dollars,"" the car driver said to the young man. ""What! Fifteen dollars? Do you think I'm a fool? Only last week I took a car from the railway station to this same hotel and I only gave the driver thirteen dollars. I know how much I have to pay for the trip. I won't pay you one dollar more than I paid to the other car driver last week.""",high15064.txt
