How are you? I'm fine. I'm in London , at a school of English. I'm in Class Seven. It has eight students. They are from different countries ----Spain, Japan , Argentina, Switzerland and Thailand. Our teacher's name is Henry Briscall. He's very nice. He's a good teacher.
I live  with an English family, Mr. and Mrs. Brown. They have two sons and a daughter. Thomas is fourteen, Catherine is twelve, and Andrew is seven. They are all very friendly to me, and we are good friends.
London is very big and very interesting. The weather   is good and the parks are nice! Hyde Park, Green Park and St. James' Park are all in the city center .
English food is OK, but the coffee is not good!
Are you all right at home in Shanghai?  Is everything OK? Write to me.
Love,
Paul",middle4337.txt
