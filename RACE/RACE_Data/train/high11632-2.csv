The pain was like a hot sword  being shoved through my head. I fell down on my hands and knees, and I knew it was bad.
I was taken to the Erlanger Hospital in Chattanooga, and the doctors operated on me several times but couldn't save my left eye. When they told me the news, I wanted to die.
Even after I got my fake  eye, I couldn't shake the sadness. To make matters worse, I lost my job as a transportation officer because of my lost eye. But one morning, I woke up and the TV was on, and there was a 16-year-old girl who had been badly burned on her face and legs. Her situation was much worse than mine. She wore a big smile and seemed to look right at me and said, ""You can't ever give up."" At that moment, I thought, ""This is just an eye. Get over it."" And I did.
It's been almost 12 years since my accident, and there's nothing I can't do now that I used to do. And although I didn't get my old job back, I got my license again.
I read a story once. In that story, a man was feeling bad because he had no shoes until he met a man who had no feet. No matter how terrible your problem is, remember there's always someone somewhere who's worse off. So cheer up and smile at life!",high11632.txt
