Try to start your talk with something fun. This will make talking easier. For example, ask them questions about their day. How is work? They love this.
Make it clear what you want to tell your parents. If they have an opinion, let them finish and don't stop their talking. Ask them to do the same for you.
Show them respect by listening to them carefully. Look at them in the eye.
Be honest. Honesty builds trust. Life is good when your parents trust you.
If your parents don't understand, that's OK. It doesn't mean that they don't love you. Sometimes you have to explain the things to them again.
When you finish the talk, thank them for listening. Say something like ""Thanks, that helps."" It will let them know that is important to you and make them want to do it more often.",middle5782.txt
