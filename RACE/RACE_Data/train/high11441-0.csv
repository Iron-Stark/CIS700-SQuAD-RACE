0,A,"['a newspaper', 'a magazine', 'a storybook', 'a guidebook']",This article is probably taken from   _,"Yesterday the police were joined by more than 20 volunteers in the continuing search for the two missing teenagers, Vicky Gray and Tom Hunter, and their guide, Gavin Jones. The police said that they had disappeared during an adventure tour of Cape York Peninsula.
This was the second day of the search and the police were now very worried about the safety of the three missing people.
The police said that the search had covered a wide area, but the rainforest was thick and their work was made harder by the recent rain. Later on Chief Inspector Roger Fleet said, ""The travelers had a radio with them. If they had been in trouble, they would have called us.""
The three travelers left Cooktown very early on Saturday morning in aToyota car. They took a small dirt road that runs down to the Daintree River, a dangerous river full of crocodiles  . Chief Inspector Roger Fleet said the tourists wouldn't have got into trouble if they had stayed on the main road.
A photo of Vicky and Tom was found by a policeman under the ""Be Careful about crocodiles"" sign near the river. Why was the photo left behind? This is just one of the unanswered questions. Other questions are: Why was the photo left behind? Why was theToyotaparked and locked at the edge of the rainforest? The police said that the travelers had left a map of the area behind. Why? Why had someone drawn a cross on the point   where the car is? Is this a sign? What does it mean? If anyone can give information or has seen these three young people, contact the local police in Cooktown.",high11441.txt
