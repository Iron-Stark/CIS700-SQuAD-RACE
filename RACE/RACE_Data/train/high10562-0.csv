0,C,"['by some crazy Internet users', 'to refer to a kind of product', 'by Hong Kong actor Jackie Chan', 'to expresssome special meaning']","From the passage we know that the word ""Duang"" was originally made  _  .","If you want to express something so unbelievable that it must have been a special effect, you have a new word to add to your vocabulary.

A video parody   adapted from a shampoo commercial featuring Hong Kong actor Jackie Chan spread quickly online, leading Internet users to invent the new word.
The video begins with Chan flashing his black, smooth hair, which would have been perfect except that it was not his real hair.
Next, a self-satisfied Chan admits, to the repetitive, rhythmical sounds of ""Duang"", ""I refused to approve of this product when they first came to me because of my thin hair, but the director insisted, saying special effects could be used to make my hair look healthy on the screen. Now you see, it's all special effects. It's not real.""
The original advertisement became the target of punishment by the government for over- spreading the effects of the shampoo after it was broadcast in 2004.
""Duang"" has now become one of the hottest topics on Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like Chinese social network site among those crazy ones imitating Jackie Chan's speech in different situations.
The actor's Weibo account was flooded with comments containing the word in this sweeping online trend.
The video came at a time when the famous movie star has been under public attention after trying to save the ill image of his son, Jaycee Chan, who was released from prison this week.
