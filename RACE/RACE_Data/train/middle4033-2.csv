They were a loving couple and the boy was a gem of their eyes.
When the boy was around two years old, one morning the husband saw a medicine bottle open. He was late for work, so he asked his wife to cap the bottle and keep it in the cupboard. His wife who was busy in the kitchen forgot the matter.
The boy saw the bottle, playfully went to it, was fascinated by its color and drank it all. It happened to be a poisonous  medicine. When the child fell to the ground, the mother took him to the hospital in a hurry, where he died. The mother was stunned. She was terrified at how to face her husband.
