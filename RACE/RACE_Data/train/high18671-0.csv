0,D,"['Both of them were out of work.', 'They wanted to live a better life.', 'The man could take better care of his business.', 'They were too poor to live in the former house.']",Why did the couple move to the small apartment?,"On a freezing cold day, a couple had to move into a small apartment because of their failure in business.The husband worked day and night to support the family but with no care of his wife.So she thought, ""He doesn't love me any more, he just cares about his business, not me"".
One day, she was about to take a shower when he stopped her at the door, ""Let me take it first, okay?""""Why not me first?"" she asked.""I am tired, honey, you take it later, okay?""She was entirely unhappy.
One day, she found nothing to do and turned on his computer.A few words came into her sight.Reading them, she burst into tears.It was his diary:
Today, I was quite sad.She asked me why I was always taking the shower first, and I said to her, I was exhausted.She was unhappy.In her mind, I treated her not as well as usual, but what could I do? I was not as rich as before! We moved to the small apartment, and there was only one shower in the bathroom.It was so cold to take a shower in such a cold winter.But I found that if one person took the shower first, the room could get a little warmer.So every day I rushed to the bathroom first.I was thinking that, when she took the shower, the room would get warmer, even if it was only 1degC.
Now I cannot give her a comfortable life, take her to good restaurants, or buy expensive dresses for her, but at least, I can give her 1degC love.",high18671.txt
