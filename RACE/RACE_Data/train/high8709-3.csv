3,A,"['deliberately throw the ball at anyone illegally blocking their way', 'keep on screaming and shouting throughout the game', 'lie down on the ground as an act of protest', 'kick the ball across the court with force']","According to the passage, players, in a game, may   _  .","""Tear' em apart!"" ""Kill the fool!"" ""Murder the referee  !""
These are common remarks one may hear at various sporting events. At the time they are made, they may seem innocent enough. But let's not kid ourselves. They have been known to influence behavior in such a way as to lead to real bloodshed. Volumes have been written about the way words affect us. It has been shown that words having certain connotations   may cause us to react in ways quite foreign to what we consider to be our usual humanistic behavior. I see the term ""opponent"" as one of those words. Perhaps the time has come to delete it from sports terms.
The dictionary meaning of the term ""opponent"" is ""adversary"" ""enemy""; ""one who opposes your interests."" Thus, when a player meets an opponent, he or she may tend to treat that opponent as an enemy. At such times, winning may dominate one's intellect, and every action, no matter how gross, may be considered justifiable. I recall an incident in a handball game when a referee refused a player's request for a time out for a glove change because he did not consider them wet enough. The player proceeded to rub his gloves across his wet T-shirt and then exclaimed. ""Are they wet enough now?""
In the heat of battle, players have been observed to throw themselves across the court without considering the consequences that such a move might have on anyone in their way. I have also witnessed a player reacting to his opponent's international and illegal blocking by deliberately hitting him with the ball as hard as he could during the course of play. Off the court, they are good friends. Does that make any sense? It certainly gives proof of a court attitude which departs from normal behavior.
Therefore, I believe it is time we elevated   the game to the level where it belongs there by setting an example to the rest of the sporting world. Replacing the term ""opponent"" with ""associate"" could be an ideal way to start.
The dictionary meaning of the term ""associate"" is ""colleague""; ""friend""; ""companion."" Reflect a moment! You may soon see and possibly feel the difference in your reaction to the term ""associate"" rather than ""opponent.""",high8709.txt
