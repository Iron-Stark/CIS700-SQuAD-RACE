And I often have junk food because I like it. In order to be healthy, I decided to change my lifestyle.    Now I get up at 6:00 am every day. Then I go out to run for about an hour. I go to a gym on Wednesday and Saturday afternoon. And I hardly have junk food. I have healthy food, like milk and fish. I often eat vegetables and I have an apple every day.
