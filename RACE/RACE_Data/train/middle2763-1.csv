1,A,"['Seven months', 'Two months', 'In October', 'In April']",How long will the campaign last?   _,"To make Chinese students healthier and stronger, China's Ministry of Education   has started a campaign. The campaign asks students to run every school day. Te campaign has started since October last year and will last until April this year.
Kids at primary schools have to run 1km per day. It's 1.5kms for middle school students and 2 kms for high  school and university students. And records will be set for every student. By the end of April 2009, a primary school student has to run 120kms in total/ A middle school students have to run 240kms by that time.
Since the campaign started, people have had different ideas about it. Some people think it is good for students. They think the campaign can make students healthier. Some students have little exercise and the campaign can make them run. But some people don't think so. They think some schools don't have enough place for students to do running. If students have to run on the road, maybe it is not safe. They also think there are many ways to become healthier; running is not the only way. So they think the campaign is not a right decision.",middle2763.txt
