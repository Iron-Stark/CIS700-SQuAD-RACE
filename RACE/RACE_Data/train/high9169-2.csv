2,D,"['that Chinese cartoonists are the greatest in the world.', ""that China's dream of being the top animation and manga nation."", 'that technology alone helps cartoonists to achieve success.', 'that a Chinese cartoonist has chased her dream and lived it.']",This passage is mainly about   _  .,"When Zhang Ning , whose pen name was Misha, started drawing manga  in junior high school, it was a time when Japanese cartoonists occupied most of the Chinese market. She was warned about the poor wage cartoonists earn and the risk of pursuing a career in an industry where China is not yet competitive.
But with the growth of domestic animation and manga industry in recent years, Zhang managed to draw her way up to become one of the country's top cartoonists. In 2011, the 29-year-old won the Golden Dragon award, one of the most influential awards in China's manga industry.
Looking back, the graduate of Zhejiang University of Technology said: ""It was a dream come true."" Zhang's success boomed along with the industry. In 2010, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, China's animation and manga industry was worth 47 billion yuan. It has seen annual growth rates of more than 20 percent in recent years.
These big numbers seem a far stretch from Zhang's in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. But she thinks the very reason why cartoonists can enjoy a decent life is the country's decision to well develop the industry. ""The country is not giving us money directly, but it's creating a market in which we can succeed,""said Zhang.
Apart from government investment, Zhang is also benefiting from technology advances. The Internet has provided a wider platform for cartoonists to publish their work. The electric edition of Zhang's work ranked the 6th among free book apps on the Apple Store. ""I think the Internet has encouraged new cartoonists and given them more chances. Before we could only contribute to magazines and it was difficult to convince the editors to publish our work"", said Zhang. ""But when you release your work online, you receive encouragement and support from many netizens. It increases your confidence. ""said Zhang.
New technology has also attracted more people to read comics. ""China has entered 3G era. It's very convenient for people to read on their smart phones when traveling around. It opens comics to a bigger readership,"" said Zhang. Only last week, Zhang published her new manga based on the ancient classic Tangzi  which set during the warring states period. According to Zhang, the inspiration came from wall painting in Dunhuang, Gansu province. She hopes her works will encouraged more people especially the young, to explore the cultural treasures of ancient China. ""Chinese youths now need a spirit to help them to realize their dreams,"" said Zhang. ""Like Kua Fu  chasing the sun --- people can accomplish great things by choosing to something seemingly beyond their ability. I think that's my ""Chinese dream"" and I want to share it with the public through my cartoons.""",high9169.txt
