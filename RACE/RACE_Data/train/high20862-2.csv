2,A,"['caring', 'generous', 'selfish', 'timid']",From the text we can know the author was   _  .,"Any passenger on the subway who caught a glimpse of me may have already thought that I was strange. In particular this gentleman sitting opposite me was staring at me, at the cheese bun on the floor in front of me, and then back at me; ""Next stop, St. Patrick Station"" my stop was quickly coming up. I had minutes to either take the cheese bun, which nobody else was claiming(as a passenger probably dropped it by mistake and got off at a previous stop), or leave it there and hope that it didn't go to waste.
    In those few minutes I felt my pride getting in the way. ""What would other people on this subway think of me if I took the Cheese bun? Would they think that I was poor and hungry? Would they think that I'm stealing?""
    The ignorant thing to do was say ""yes"" to any of those self-imposed   questions, which would only justify my ego. But then I'd get off the subway, walk a block up the street to my office, get settled at my desk, and despite feeling comfortable, warm, and being well-fed myself for the whole day, there would be a weight of guilt and regret weighing on my consciousness.
    My thoughts were pushing me towards pride and ignorance when the truth was evident:this missing cheese bun is a gift. For a homeless person who is hungry and cold. For me to overcome a little bit of ego and pass along so much kindness. It was clear that the homeless person who would receive this cheese bun needed it just as much as I did. ks5u
    Just as the doors opened at my stop I grabbed the cheese bun and exited the subway. It felt awesome and I didn't care if people were looking or what they thought. Instead of going directly to my office as usual, I walked a few more blocks up to Queen's Park where I have seen a homeless man sitting outside many times on my walk from the gym to my office. I always wanted to give him something. There he was this morning, wrapped in a sleeping bag.",high20862.txt
