I started the DailyStep audio email lesson service because I noticed that when I started their English course, my students' speaking and listening skills were much weaker than their reading and writing skills. In my view, this is because education in school does not focus enough on communication skills. DailyStep is designed to _ this situation by offering more practice in speaking, listening and vocabulary.
I am crazy about the English language and it is a real pleasure for me to see the development of my students' language skills.
I majored in (....)law at university and then worked for three years as a researcher and journalist for Sky television and BBC magazines. I decided to change to English teaching because of my love of the English language and my wish to move into more satisfying work.
Then I qualified  as an English teacher in 1992. My first teaching job was at a language school in Covent Garden, London, where I taught examination classes and Business English . After two years, I moved to the Nippon Club where I taught General English and Business English courses for 9 years. I also developed a unique course called British Society & Culture, covering all areas of British life, such as politics, law, education & music. At the same time, taught Business, Financial& Law English in the financial centre of London. My students included staff  from banks and law firms.
As well as running the DailyStep website, I also provide in-company English speech training for companies in London. If you have an important speech coming up and would like some information about how I can help you, please email me at jane@dailystep.com.",high11346.txt
