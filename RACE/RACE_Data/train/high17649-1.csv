1,A,"['should seek broader space for development', 'was the most competitive company in the world', 'differed from many old-line industrial companies', ""was a big company with a small-company's spirit""]","According to the author, GE in 1981   _  .","Throughout my 41 years at General Electric, I've experienced a lot.In the media, I've gone from prince to pig and back again.And I've been called many things.
In the early days, some called me a crazy, wild man.When I became CEO two decades ago, Wall Street asked, ""Jack who?""
When I tried to make GE more competitive by cutting back our workforce in the early 1980s, the media called me ""Neutron Jack.""

I've put my mind, my heart, and my courage into that journey every day of the 40-plus years I've been lucky enough to be a part of GE.",high17649.txt
