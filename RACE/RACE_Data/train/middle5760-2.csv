2,C,"['Their two children were ill.', 'Their mother was ill in hospital.', 'Their son fell off his bike and broke his leg.', 'Everything was all right.']",What happened to her family during their stay in Europe?,"The Sweetest Sight
I was in the most beautiful city in the world, yet I only wanted home.
It was an amazing week for my husband and me--the trip of a lifetime. Months ago, when my husband told me that he would have a meeting in London, I told him my wish to go to Europe together with him. Then we asked his mother to look after our two children and started off.
During the week's time, we visited London and Paris--as much as we could, Big Ben, the Eiffel Tower and so on. All these were beautiful places we expected to see before. We really had a fantastic time.
On our last night in Paris, after we enjoyed the night sight of the Eiffel Tower, my husband called home. His mother answered the phone. In a second, my husband's face fell and looked so worried. I could feel there was something bad.
""What's wrong?"" I asked.
He didn't answer and went on to listen. A few minutes later, he said sadly to me that Tony, our seven-year-old son, fell down from his bike and broke his leg. He must be sent to hospital at once.
At that moment, Paris suddenly lost its charm .
""I don't want to be here! I shouldn't be here! I should be home with my kids!""
We hurried back to our hotel and then to the airport...
Finally, we got home. We rushed into our children's bedroom. Seeing our two children, I suddenly understood the truth: There is no sweeter sight in the world than our children's faces that greet us at home.",middle5760.txt
