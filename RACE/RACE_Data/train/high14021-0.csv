0,B,"['From other shoppers.', 'Through the cameras of the market.', 'From the shop assistants.', 'By talking with Mr.Denner.']",How did the market get to know about Mr.Denner's strange behavior?,"Dear Mrs.Denner,
Over the past five months, your husband has been causing quite a commotion  in our store. Our complaints  against Mr.Denner are listed below:
July 2:Set all the alarm clocks in house-wares to go off at 5-minute intervals .
July 7: Made a trail  of tomato juice on the floor leading to the women's restroom.
August 4: Took a bag of _ from the candy shelf and handed out to the passing children to eat.
September 14:Moved a ""CAUTION--WET FLOOR"" sign to a carpeted area.
September 15: Set up a tent in the camping department and told other shoppers he'd invite them in if they would bring pillows and blankets from the bedding department.
September 23:When a clerk asked if they could help him ,he began crying and screamed,""Why can't you people just leave me alone?""
October 4: Looked right into the security camera and used it as a mirror while he picked his nose.
November 10: While handling guns in the hunting department, he asked the clerk where the antidepressants were.
December 3:Darted around the store while loudly humming the ""Mission Impossible"" theme.
December 6:In the auto department, he practiced his ""Madonna look"" by using different sizes of funnels.
December 18:Hid in a clothing rack  and when people looked through, yelled ""PICK ME!PICK ME!""
December 21:When an announcement came over the loud speaker, he assumed a fatal position and screamed ""OH NO!IT'S THOSE VOICES AGAIN!""
December 23:Went into a fitting room , shut the door, waited a while, and then yelled very loudly,""Hey! There's no toilet paper in here!""
Our video surveillance cameras recorded all these. Never once did our reminding and warning work and therefore we are forced to ban him from the store.
Regards,
