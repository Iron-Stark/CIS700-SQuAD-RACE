It will be easier to style. If you've ever washed your hair just before going to the salon to get another better look, you will be told by the stylist, freshly washed and dried hair isn't as easy to work with as hair that was washed a day or two ago.
Your color will last longer. If you color your hair, washing daily can _ your color and lead to more trips to the salon. Keep your hair looking bright by only washing every other day. When you wash your hair, do so with a shampoo so that you can make sure the color doesn't lose.
It will be healthier. The more you wash your hair, the more you're removing your hair's natural oil.
