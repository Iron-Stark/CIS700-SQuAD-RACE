1,D,"['he has collected books about every sort of animal', 'he has lived in zoos all over the world', 'he has lived all the time on a Greek island', 'he has travelled all over the world collecting animals']",Since he left school  _  .,"A close friend of mine lives with six hundred wild animals on the Greek Island of Kyklos.Ever since he left school (where I first knew him),he has travelled all over the world collecting animals for his very own zoo.He hoped to collect at least two examples of every sort of animal on his island before the Great Flood. But the flood that my friend was afraid of was a flood not of water, but of people. I expect you have heard of my friend: he writes books about his travels,and about the wild and wonderful animals that he collects. The money from the books helps to pay for all the food that these animals eat.
My friend told me that when he was out looking for water last week,(there is not enough water on the island,though there is plenty all round it,)he found oil.He needs money for his travels,and for his zoo,and a little oil would  buy enough water for a lifetime;but he knows that if he tells anybody else about it,it will be the end of his zoo, and his life's work.
So,if I know my friend,he will not tell anybody (but you and me)about what he found--because oil and water do not mix.",high7281.txt
