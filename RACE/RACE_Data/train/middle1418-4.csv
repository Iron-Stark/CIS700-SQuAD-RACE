4,D,"['Tell us not to study at home all the time.', 'Tell us only to make friends with people you like.', ""It's hard to make friends if you stay at home."", 'Tell us how we can make more friends']",What's the main idea of the passage?,"It's hard to make friends if you stay at home alone all the time. Get out of house and do things that will put you in touch with other people. It's easier to make friends when you have similar interests.
Don't be afraid to show people what you're really good at. Talk about things you like and do best. People will be interested in you if there is something interesting about you.
Look at people in the eyes when you talk to them. That way , they'll find it easier to talk to you.
Be a good listener. Let people talk about themselves before talking about ""me ,me, me""
Try to make friends with the kinds of people you really like, respect and admire ,not just with those who we are easy to meet. Be friends with a  lot of people .That way ,you 'll have a bigger group of people to choose and have more chances for making friends.",middle1418.txt
