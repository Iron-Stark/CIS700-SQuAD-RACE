If so, is it a big bear? Is it a monkey? Or is it a kind of man?
No one knows. This mystery has puzzled the world for years.
In 1887, a mountain climber found large footprints in the snow. They looked like the footprints of a very large man. But men don't walk without shoes in the snow!
In 1906, other climbers saw more than footprints. Far away they saw a very large animal standing on two legs. As they watched, it ran very quickly.
Fifteen years later, newspapers, had new stories about the ""something"". A mountain climber said he had seen the ""snow man"" walk slowly across the snow, far below him. He said it looked like a very large man.
From then on, more and more people had stories to tell. But not until 1951 did a mountain climber bring back pictures of large footprints. His pictures showed clearly that the snowman walked on two legs, so it was not a bear or a monkey. Could it be an ape man? The mystery grew! And the mystery keeps growing. Some day we may find out just what it is that makes the large footprints.",high17552.txt
