The experience can be very bad for kids, who may not be a part of the decision to move and may not understand it. You can take steps to make the entire process   easier for everyone.
Many kids like to stay in familiar places. So as you consider a move, weigh the benefits   of that change against the comfort that neighborhood, school, and social life give your kids. If your family has recently dealt with a big life change, such as death, you may want to put off a move to give your children time to accept the fact.
The decision to move may be out of your hands, perhaps because of a new job or money problems. Even if you're not happy about the move, try to keep a positive  attitude to it. During the move, a parent's attitude can greatly influence kids.
No matter what the results are, the most important way to prepare kids to move is to talk about it. Try to give your children as much information about the move as possible. You can ask kids to join in the planning such as house-hunting or the search for a new school. This can make the change feel less like it's being forced on them.
