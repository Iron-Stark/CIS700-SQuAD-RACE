2,C,"['Vivien could even draw.', 'The family tried hard to look for the pet.', 'The owner knew how the cat found her way home.', 'Many people lost their houses, their cars and their pets because of the hurricane.']",Which of the following is NOT true?,"Whenever there's a terrible storm, there are plenty of sad stories. Many people lost their houses, their cars and their pets. But sometimes these stories have happy endings too.
A family in New Jersey, US, had a cat named Vivien. She is very smart. She could even draw with her wet paws on the floor. They all love her very much. When hurricane   Sandy hit America in October, they moved to a safer place-13km away from home. Sadly Vivien went missing. The whole family were worried about her. They put up posters on the Internet to look for her. All the nine family members searched wherever they thought she could stay, but they didn't find it. The family thought Vivien was gone forever.
But six months later, Vivien showed up at their house, according to Yahoo News. They considered her return as a wonder. No one can be sure where Vivien was for all that time.
Many animals are good at finding their way home. People usually say that dogs and cats find their way home through using their sense of smell.
But that doesn't explain how Vivien found her way back. Hurricane Sandy blew away the normal smells of home.
