0,C,"['hates to teach English', 'is a teacher of Chinese', 'loves her job', 'is angry with the headmaster']",Miss Wang  _  .,"Miss Wang is a young teacher of English in a middle school in Chongqing. She loves teaching very much. One day when she was giving an English lesson, she found Mr. Li, the headmaster, sitting at the back of the classroom. After class, Mr. Li told her that he came to her class to find out how much English and Chinese she was using in class. The result was about half English and half Chinese. She was using Chinese when she gave instructions   and explained some grammar rules to her students. Mr. Li suggested that she should use English as much as she could in class.
So Miss Wang made the following plans:
Join an English club and practice speaking English.
Learn more English teaching expressions by heart.
Have a five-minute talk with students in English before class.
She used body language to make herself understood if students could not follow. One year later, she found she could speak English _ in class.
