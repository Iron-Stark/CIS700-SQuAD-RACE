1,A,"['To fly.', 'To jump.', 'To look for food.', 'To build houses.']",What did Mr Robin ask his babies to do first?,"Mr Robin had his house in a tree.
His four baby robins lived in it. They grew very fast. Soon the house was too little for them.
""It is time for you to fly,"" said Mr Robin.
""Oh, we can not fly,"" said the baby robins.
""You can, if you try, "" said Mr Robin.
A robin tried. He flew into a tree.
""Oh, how interesting!"" said the little robin. ""I like to fly. See me go!""
Then the other robins tried.
In a little while they could all fly.
The robins could fly, but they could not sing.
""No, Dad, we can not sing.""
""You can, if you try. Hear the other birds sing. Look at the pretty flowers and the blue sky. Then you will want to sing. Hear me sing to you. Now sing for me.""
One little robin sang.
Then they all sang.
A little girl came by. ""Wow, hear the birds sing!"" she said. ""How happy they are!""",middle5143.txt
