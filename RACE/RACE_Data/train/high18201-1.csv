1,D,"['she heard a noise coming from the bathroom.', ""she couldn't find her two daughters in the morning."", 'she found the toilet in the bathroom had not been flushed.', 'she learned her daughters had been using her toothbrush.']",The writer must feel worst when   _  .,"I am a mother of three girls. Getting married and having children was my childhood goal in life. By the time I had my third daughter, my middle daughter was not quite two and my oldest was three and a half. I loved them so much, yet there were some days I referred to as ""too much of a good thing"".
              As any mother of young children knows, when the children are quiet, they're either sleeping or in trouble. This morning, I knew that the only sleeping child at this time of day could be the baby. I was wondering whether I should enjoy the silence or ruin my peace --- and the girls' fun.
              Finally, I thought I'd better go and find out what those two were doing. I could hear a noise. It was coming from the bathroom. As I got closer, I could see that the door was closed. I said to myself, ""Oh no, please not the toilet again!""
              Sure enough, when I opened the door I saw Candace and Charity standing around the toilet, dipping their toothbrushes in --- and brushing their teeth! Not only that, but the toilet was unflushed  !
              I hardly had any words to speak. As I snatched the toothbrushes out of their hands and flushed the toilet I shouted, ""What are you doing?""
              Candace, my oldest daughter, answered, ""We're brushing our teeth!"" They both smiled at me.
              Hoping this was the only time they had ever done this shocking thing, I asked, ""You never did this before, did you?"" Candace answered, ""Oh, we do it all the time, mommy. We do it with yours and Daddy's toothbrush, too!""
              The moral of the story: What you don't know won't hurt you; but when you do find out, it just might kill you!",high18201.txt
