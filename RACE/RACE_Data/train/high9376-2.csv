2,A,"['Words show differences in culture.', 'Chinese people prefer dogs to cats.', 'Western people think cats to be good friends.', 'Rose is the national flower of all western countries.']",Which of the following is true according to the passage?,"As we know, there are differences between western culture and Chinese culture. We can see differences when we pay attention to the way words are used. Let's look at the words about animals and plants. Most expressions in Chinese about the dog, for example, ""a homeless dog"", ""a mad dog"", ""a running dog"" and ""a dog catching a mouse"", have negative meanings. But in western countries, dogs are thought to be honest and good friends of humans. In English, people use the dog to describe positive actions. For example, ""you are a lucky dog"" means you are a lucky person. And ""every dog has its day"" means each person has good luck sometimes. To describe a person's serious illness, they say ""sick as a dog"". The word ""dog-tired"" means very tired. However, Chinese love cats very much. But in western culture, ""cat"" is often used to describe a woman who is cruel. There are many other examples of how ""cat"" is used differently as well.
The rose is regarded as a symbol of love in both China and some western countries. People think the rose stands for love, peace, courage and friendship. And the rose is the national flower of England, America and many other countries.
