2,A,"['He was devoted to   the family.', 'He saw that no one bid for it.', 'He knew the content   of the will.', 'He found it cheap for him to buy.']",Why did the old servant bid for the painting of Fitzgerald's son?,"The very wealthy   English Baron Fitzgerald had only one child, a son, who understandably   was the apple of his eye. His wife died when the child was in his early teens. So Fitzgerald devoted himself to (...) fathering the kid. Unfortunately the son died in his late teens.
Meanwhile, Fitzgerald's wealth greatly increased. He spent a lot on art works of the masters  . Later Fitzgerald himself became seriously ill. Before his death, he had carefully prepared his will   as to how his wealth would be settled - to sell his entire collection   at an auction  .
Because of the large quantity   and high quality   of his collection, a huge crowd of possible buyers gathered for the auction. Many of them were museum directors   and private collectors   eager to bid  . Before the auction, the art works were shown, among which was a painting of Fitzgerald's son by an unknown artist. Because of its poor quality, it received little attention.
When it was time for the auction, the auctioneer   gaveled   the crowd to attention. First the lawyer read from Fitzgerald's will that the first art work to be auctioned was the painting of his son.
The poor-quality painting didn't receive any bidders, except one old servant who had served the son and loved him, and who for emotional   reasons offered the only bid.
As soon as the servant bought the painting for less than one English pound, the auctioneer stopped the bidding and asked the lawyer to read again from the will. The crowd became quiet, and the lawyer read from the will: ""Whoever buys the painting of my son gets all my collection."" Then the auction was over.",high22690.txt
