1,D,"['Lily is entering kindergarten.', ""Jay's grandson Manny starts high school."", 'Phil loses his job.', 'Claire goes back to work.']",What's new in Modern Family's fifth season?,"It's not so surprising that US First Lady Michelle Obama has called Modern Family her favorite TV series. September saw the fun, heartwarming sitcom take home the Best Comedy Series award at the 2013 Emmys. This is the fourth year in a row that the series has won that title. The show features three families who move in and out of each other's lives. The first one is a typical American family: the working dad Phil, stay-at-home mom Claire and their three children.
The second family is made up of Jay, his young Hispanic wife and her son Manny. Jay, 65, is the father of Claire. He is 30 years older than his wife and everyone mistakes the two for being father and daughter.
The third family is made up of a gay couple, Mitchell and Cameron, and their adopted daughter Lily. Mitchell is Jay's son.
On Sept 25, the show started its fifth season, in which Claire makes a big change - she returns to work. The other big storylines include Jay's stepson Manny starting high school and Mitchell and Cameron looking for a primary school for Lily. Will things go right for the three families?
Modern Family has no spies, aliens or vampires  ; it's just about ordinary people. So what has made it such a hit?
According to the Los Angeles Times, its ""presentation of contemporary US society"" contributes to its success. The show presents what a typical ""nuclear family"" is like in the US: two parents, a big house and two or three children. When there's a fight between their kids, Phil wants to be the ""cool dad"" while traditional mom Claire lives by the saying ""an eye for an eye"". She always forces Phil to punish the troublemaker.
The show also touches upon developments in interracial relations in the US by focusing on Hispanic communities. This makes sense, as ""by 2040, America will no longer be a majority-white country, with the fastest growth rate among Hispanics..."" BBC pointed out.
In addition, according to BBC, 40 percent of Americans say they have a gay friend or relative. By including Mitchell and Cameron, Modern Family reflects the changing status of gay people in the US.
""The US is a melting pot ... so the family has come to reflect that diversity."" commented The Hartman Group, a US research firm.",high7971.txt
