2,C,"['The father\'s parents used to say ""I wish you enough"".', 'The father was sad when his daughter left.', ""The writer was the father's friend."", 'The father wished his daughter to live a happy life.']",Which is NOT mentioned according to the passage?,"In their last moment before the flight took off, I heard a father saying to his daughter, ""I love you, I wish you enough."" The daughter said, ""Daddy, our life together has been more than enough. Your love is all I ever needed. I wish you enough to."" They kissed goodbye and the daughter left. I could see the father was very sad.
Suddenly the father walked towards me and asked me, ""Did you ever say goodbye to someone knowing it would be the last time?""
His words made me think of my father. Realizing that my father's days were limited  , I took the time to tell him face to face how much he meant to me. So I understood what this father was experiencing.
""Yes, I did."" I answered, ""But why is this a last goodbye?""
""I am old and my daughter lives much too far away. Maybe her next trip back will be for my funeral  ,"" he said.
""When you were saying goodbye, I heard you say 'I wish you enough'. What does that mean?""
He began to smile. ""My parents used to say it to me. When we say 'I wish you enough', we want the other person to have a life filled with enough good things."" He stopped for a moment and continued, ""I wish you enough sun to keep your attitude bright. I wish you enough rain to appreciate (, ) the sun more. I wish you enough happiness to keep your spirit alive. I wish you enough pain so that the smallest joys in life seem much bigger... I wish you enough 'Hellos' to get you through the final 'Goodbye'"".
He then said goodbye to me and walked away.",middle4962.txt
