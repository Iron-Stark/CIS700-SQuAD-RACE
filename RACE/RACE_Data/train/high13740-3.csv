3,C,"['The Changes of Family Meals', 'Equality between Men and Women', 'Cooking into a New Trend for Men', 'Cooking--a Thing of the Past for Women']",Which is the best title for the passage?,"Men are spending more and more time in the kitchen encouraged by celebrity   chefs like Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver, according to a report from Oxford University.
The effect of the celebrity role models, who have given cooking a more manly picture, has combined with a more general drive towards sexual equality and men now spend more than twice the amount of time preparing meals than they did in 1961.
According to the research by Prof. Jonatahn Gershuny, who runs the Centre for Time Research at Oxford, men now spend more than half an hour a day cooking, up from just 12 minutes a day in 1961.
Prof. Gershuny said, ""The man in the kitchen is part of a much wider social trend. There has been 40 years of sexual equality, but there is another 40 years probably to come.""
Women, who a generation ago spent nearly two hours a day cooking, now spend just one hour and seven minutes--a great fall, but they still spend far more time in the kitchen than men.
Some experts have named these men in aprons as ""Gastrosexuals (men using cooking skills to impress friends)"", who have been inspired to pick up a kitchen knife by the success of Ramsay, Oliver as well as other male celebrity chefs such as Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Marco Pierre White and Keith Floyd.
""I was married in 1974. When my father came to visit me a few weeks later, I was wearing an apron when I opened the door. He laughed,"" said Prof. Gershuny. ""That would never happen now.""
Two-thirds of adults say that they come together to share at least three times a week, even if it is not necessarily around a kitchen or dining room table. Prof. Gershuny pointed out that the family meal was now rarely eaten by all of its members around a table--with many ""family meals"" in fact taken on the sofa in the sitting room, and shared by family members. ""The family meal has changed a lot, and few of us eat--as I did when I was a child--at least two meals a day together as a family. But it has survived in a different format.""",high13740.txt
