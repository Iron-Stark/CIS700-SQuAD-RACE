2,D,"['No, and he was very unhappy.', 'No, but came second.', 'Yes, he won the doubles.', 'No, but he enjoyed watching it.']",Did the writer win the table tennis tournament?,"I think the Buddy Club is great. I really enjoy talking with the older students about school life and growing up. They can tell me a lot. One student told me how he relaxed   before exams. Another student told me about great websites about learning History and English.
The Buddy Club is also a good place to just forget about school altogether! One of the older students taught us origami  . We made paper planes, birds and hats together.
The table tennis tournament  was a great idea. I didn't do very well, but I learnt a lot from watching the doubles tournament won by a fourteen-year-old girl and a seventeen-year-old boy.
Last year, we had the annual   Buddy Club Picnic. Everyone enjoyed the games we played. After I learnt how to fish, I caught two fish in the lake. I think it might be a good idea to change the Buddy Club Picnic to a weekend camping trip. We could learn how to put up   tents   and how to find our way through a forest. Many of the older students know how to do this already, and I think they would like to teach the younger students.
I want to say again how much I enjoy the club. When I'm older, I will make friends with younger students. Then, I can tell them all about school life and growing up.",middle3806.txt
