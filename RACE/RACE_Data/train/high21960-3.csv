3,D,"['serf the Internet after listening to music', 'use a cell phone against a background of television', 'complete all kinds of tasks within the same day', 'have lots of tasks queuing for responses']","If we   _  , our brains may reach information overload.","Many people think it is safe to use a cell phone while they are driving. Yet Scores of studies suggest that real multitaskers - those who can carry out multiple   tasks equally well, make up just 2 per cent of the population. More surprisingly, the so-called ""supertaskers"" actually have differently structured brains to the other 98 percent. 
The brain areas that make supertaskers differ from the rest of the population are the same parts that are most different between humans and nonhuman primates  , according to David Strayer, director of the applied cognition lab at the University of Utah. Scientists are unsure of the reason why some brains are different. In fact, we could all benefit from doing just one task at once.
In most of us, scientists have located a ""bottleneck in the brain"" that may explain why we find it hard to do two things at once.
The problem appears to be caused by a logjam of nerve messages. Faced with two almost simultaneous   tasks less than 300 milliseconds apart, the brain's ability to deal with the second one slows down. The neural   response to the second task was postponed until the response to the first was completed. This means that with e-mails, phone calls, text messages and online social media all competing for our attention, often against a background of television, radio or music, our brains can reach information overload. 
Scientists made the discovery after scanning the brains of volunteers attempting to multitask on a computer. The task was deliberately designed to involve the use of different senses and  _ responses.
Dr Rene Marois, one of the neuroscientists who carried out the experiment at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, said: ""Our research offers neurological evidence that the brain cannot effectively do two things at once."" The next step, the neuroscientists say, is finding out ""why these areas cannot process two tasks at once.""",high21960.txt
