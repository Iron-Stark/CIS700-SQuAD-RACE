0,C,"['show how rude the teenagers are', 'complain the way some people act', ""express his worry about Germany's future"", 'show how lazy young people nowadays are']",Mr. Vogts writes this letter to the editor to   _  .,"Dear Editor,
I am writing to ask what has happened to our youth. They are not as polite, hard-working or clever as my generation.  I will give you two examples.
Last Friday, I got on the underground at 9.15a.m. It was very busy so there were no free seats. There were some teenagers sitting on the seats nearest me. I didn't know why they were not at school. They were talking loudly and laughing. It was difficult to read my newspaper with all the noise. A heavily pregnant  woman and her daughter got on at the next stop, with lots of shopping bags. I expected the teenagers to let them sit down. They saw the woman but did nothing. I had to ask them to give her a seat. They reluctantly did so but give me a rude look. I got off at the next stop and was glad that the teenagers didn't follow me.
Last Saturday, I had dinner with my friend's family. I was expecting to meet his children, who I hadn't seen for ten years. During dinner, we started talking about world politics. It soon became clear that they didn't know much. They couldn't tell me the name of the King of Spain or the President of Italy. All they knew about was the Internet and which singers were the most beautiful. In my day, students knew the kings, queens and presidents of every country in Europe.
I worry about the future of Germany. How could these young people become responsible workers and parents? They sit around Macdonald's after instead of going to the library like I did at their age. Maybe they have too much money. Perhaps another reader can give us an idea about what to do with this""lost generation"".
