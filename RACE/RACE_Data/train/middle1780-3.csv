3,A,"['He felt the old man was kind and warm.', 'He felt pity for the old man.', 'He felt angry with the old man', 'He felt doubt if the old man was a thief.']",How did Mark feel about the old man at last?,"When Mark first arrived in Thailand, he saw an old man selling something cheap in the street of Chiang Mai. The old man was one of the poor people in Chiang Mai and there was no difference from beggars  . Most of them were some lonely old people. Their life had no support.
Mark was a kind man, so he gave some changes to him without thinking. The old man told him to pick something he liked. Mark didn't choose anything and left.
But the old man followed him closely. AT first, Mark didn't think a lot, just supposing he wanted to go home. But when he went out very far saw the old man still following him, he was a bit tired, thinking the old man must feel he was kind and wanted to beg more money from him.
Mark turned back and told him not to follow him because he hadn't much money. But the old man seemed not to understand what he meant, still following him. The bag on his back made him sweat   all over.
Mark happened to meet his Thai colleague   in the street and his colleague heard this. The colleague turned to ask why the old man was following his friend.
The old man said out of breath, ""My son, you gave me money, but didn't want my things, so I have to give you something. I see you are a foreigner, likely not to familiar with here. I just want to follow you and show you the way. All I can do for you is this.""
Mark was shocked. He said he didn't know why, when he felt the old man was just like his father.",middle1780.txt
