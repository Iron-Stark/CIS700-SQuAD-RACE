Set your target.
While you should always keep your options open to changing your mind , you should also be sure to target exactly what you want in a job. A job-hunt with a clear target will surely help you achieve better results than an aimless one.
Schedule plenty of interviews.
Use every possible method to get interviews-answering ads, using search firms , getting in touch with companies directly , surfing the Web, and networking( ). Even if a job is not perfect for you, every interview can become one of your positive experiences.
Follow up
Even if someone does not hire you ,write them a thank -you note for the interview. Then, some weeks later, send another brief  letter to explain that you still have not found the perfect position and that you will be available to interview again if the original position you applied for--or any other position , for that matter -is open. Do this with every position you interview for, and you may just catch a break!
Make it your full-time job
You can't find a job by looking sporadically( ) . You have to make time for it. If you're unemployed and looking , devote as much time as you would to a full -time job. If you have a job while you're looking, figure out an organized schedule to maximize your searching time.
Network vertically( )
In the search stage of your job hunt , talk to people who are on a level above you in your desired industry. They'll have an accurate and deep understanding that people at your level won't have , and will be in a good position to hire you or recommend you to be hired .
Keep your spirits up
