Write a story together. Let the kids come up with a story of their own. They might want to write stories individually and then read them aloud to others, or they might want to get together and write a story together.
Play ""let's pretend"" games. Let the kids pretend to be teachers, doctors, nurses or policemen. Let them dress up in whatever you may have. Then let them play the roles. You might even volunteer to be the student or the patient. 
Have a party. Let the kids pick out some music and dance around the room. Then,
let them fall all over themselves with laughter, when you show them how it was done when you were a kid.
