In 1955,bus seats for African Americans and whites were separated in parts of the U.S.. On December 1,1955,in the city of Montgomery,Alabama,a conflict,or disagreement,started when an African American woman named Rosa Parks refused to give her bus seat to a white man and go to the back of the bus. The police took 42yearold Parks to jail.
The African American community was extremely angry. They had a meeting and decided to work together to protest discrimination. They agreed to boycott  the buses on the day that Parks went to court. The day was a success. Empty buses drove through the streets. The city lost money. The community decided to continue the boycott. They elected a man named Martin Luther King,Jr. to be the leader.
The boycott continued. It was difficult for African Americans to get to work without buses,but they didn't stop the boycott. The city continued to lose money. Finally,the U.S. Supreme Court decided that Montgomery's bus laws were unfair and gave the African American community equal right. On December 21,1956,the bus boycott ended.
The Montgomery Bus Boycott was the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement. The movement eventually led to the Civil Rights Act in 1964,a set of laws that made discrimination a crime. During the Montgomery Bus Boycott,people worked together to change the government. Today,people in the U.S. continue to work together for a change. Now hundreds of organizations and community groups work to protect the rights of U.S. citizens and residents.",high1935.txt
