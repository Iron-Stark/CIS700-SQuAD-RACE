0,C,"['Because he developed a kind of disease.', 'Because he was so boring that he wanted to play a joke with his son.', 'Because he wanted to know whether his son was as patient as he used to be.', 'Because his son used to love playing this game with him.']",Why did the old father keep asking his son the same question?,"An 80-year-old man was sitting on the sofa in his house along with his 45-year-old highly educated son.
Suddenly a crow perched on their window.
The father asked his son, ""What is this?""
The son replied, ""It is a crow.""
After a few minutes, the father asked his son the 2
time, ""What is this?""
The son said, ""Father, I have just now told you 'It's a crow'.""
After a little while, the old father again asked his son the 3
time, ""What is this?""
At this time some expression of
was felt in the son's tone when he said to his father. ""It's a crow, a crow, a crow.""
A little after, the father again asked his son the 4
time, ""What is this?""
This time the son shouted at his father, ""Why do you keep asking me the same question again and again, although I have told you so many times 'IT IS A CROW'. Are you not able to understand this?""
A little later the father went to his room and came back with an old tattered diary, which he had maintained since his son was born. On opening a page, he asked his son to read that page. When the son read it, the following words were written in the diary:
""Today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa, when a crow was sitting on the window. My son asked me 23 times what it was, and I replied to him all 23 times that it was a crow. I hugged him lovingly each time he asked me the same question again and again for 23 times. I did not at all feel irritated, I rather felt affection for my innocent child.""",high16331.txt
