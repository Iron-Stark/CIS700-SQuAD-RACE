If you are looking for an exciting, fun and challenging white water tour, Rafting  the GRAND CANYON is here to help you plan the right tour for you. Whether you want to travel for two days or ten, hike in or not, go on an oar  boat or motorboat, through Class 3 or 6 water, we will help you find the trip that meets your needs.
For those who will be vacationing in the off-season, a rafting trip on the Native American Red River is available or a one-day trip is available on the Colorado River from Diamond Creek to Pierce Ferry.
Most of the trips depart from Lees Ferry, Arizona. We offer partial trips which allow you to get on or off at Phantom Ranch located at the bottom of the Grand Canyon National Park South Rim. You can have a hike, and with proper planning the mule  ride up or down is also an option. Most trips occur between April and October.
Since all rafting on the Colorado requires a permit, planning and reserving your trip requires reservations well in advance. Please let us know when you would like to go and we will contact all the river concessionaires  to help you find the best trip for you.
