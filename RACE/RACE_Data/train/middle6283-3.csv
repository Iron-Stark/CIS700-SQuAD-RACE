3,D,"['My school', 'My ideal subject', 'My school day', 'My ideal school']",What's the best title for the passage?,"I like to get up late, so my ideal school starts at 9: 00 a. m. It finishes at 3: 00 p. m. So we can do lots of sports after school.
In my ideal school, there is a big dining hall. We have an hour for lunch. We can listen to music in the hall. We can have maths every day because I think maths is very interesting. The classes are very small. There are 15 students in each class. We can have a big library with a lot of _ books. We can also have a swimming pool.
After school, we only have half an hour of homework every day. Every month, we can go on a school trip to a museum or a theater.",middle6283.txt
