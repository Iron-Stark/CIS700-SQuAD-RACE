He and her mother divorced when she was just a young child. Even though he didn't move far, he never came to visit his children.
Lisa often wondered about her father. What did he look like and what was he doing? All she knew was his name: Jeff White.
After Lisa grew up, she became a nurse at a hospital, where she would help provide medicine and comfort for patients in their final days. A few weeks ago, she received a new patient whose name was Jeff White.
When Jeff came into his room, Lisa asked him if he had any children. Jeff told her that he had two daughters, Lisa and Elly. Lisa couldn't hold her tears back. She told him, ""I am Lisa, your daughter.""
Jeff embraced her, saying that he was not a good father. And the daughter held his hand and kissed him. Then Jeff began to sing This Magic Moment.
Jeff could have just weeks left to live, so Lisa wanted to make the most of the time she had with him. Lisa also brought her kid to the hospital to meet their grandfather. The kid made cards for him with the words, ""I love you.""",middle7584.txt
