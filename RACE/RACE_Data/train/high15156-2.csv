2,D,"['If we are not careful about our unconscious acts, the images of ourselves presented to others will be quite undesirable.', ""The good habits formed in one's childhood will benefit him throughout his life."", 'If parents do not care about the disrespectful attitude adopted by their children towards themselves, their children might be disrespectful to others.', 'It is unlikely that a well-mannered person will not embarrass himself in public.']",Which of the following are NOT true?,"We would probably all be amazed if we watched a videotape of ourselves performing basically unconscious acts as we go about the business of the day. These unconscious acts consist of all the little personal habits that we don't even think about, but definitely should. These are some of the things that present an image of who we are to others, and if we are careless in performing them, this image may well be other than we would like it to be.
Parents who insist that their children practice good manners and habits at home are doing them a great service, for these habits then become lifelong and the natural way they do things. It proves true that their unconscious actions will reflect a well-mannered person.
People who, for example, eat with both arms on the table at home will likely do so when out. Those who are lazy and slow in private will certainly be so in public. Children who are permitted to be disrespectful to their parents will follow suit with other adults, and will, most likely, become adults who are disrespectful of others.

There is an article about the actress, Audrey Hepburn, known for her beautiful carriage and posture. According to her biographer, her grandmother tied her neck to the back of her chair, at table, so that she would not drop down suddenly over her food, but rather would learn to put only small amounts of food on her spoon or fork and bring them to her mouth. This is a rather extreme ""at home"" method for the development of erect   posture, but it does illustrate the effectiveness of practicing good habits so that, when in public, they are instinctive.",high15156.txt
