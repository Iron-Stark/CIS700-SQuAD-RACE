In fact, a team from the universities of Florida and Nebraska says it has found a link between the Earth heating up and the size of mammals - horses, in this case.
The scientists used fossils to follow the evolution of horses from their earliest appearance 56 million years ago. As temperature went up,their size went down, and vice versa ;"" At one point they were as small as a house cat,"" said Dr Jonathan Bloch, curator  of the Florida Museum of Natural History, which was quoted by the ""Daily Mail"" as saying.
The scientists say that the current warming could have the same effect on mammals and could even make humans smaller.""Horses started out small, about the size of a small dog . What's surprising is that after they first appeared, they then became even smaller and then dramatically increased in size, and that exactly _ the global warming event, followed by cooling""
""It had been known that mammals were small during that time and that it was warm, but we hadn't realized that temperature specifically was driving the evolution of body size,"" Dr Bloch said in the ""Science"" journal.",high6302.txt
