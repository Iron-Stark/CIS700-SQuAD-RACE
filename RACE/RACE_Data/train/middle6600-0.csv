0,A,"['Mobile phones.', 'Cigarettes.', 'Clothes.', 'Computer games.']",What do some children want their parents to buy for them ?,"Now if you go out or surf(;)the Internet,  one word is very popular among young people. That is the word ""fashion"". But lots of young people don't know what it really means. They just think an iPhone 6 is fashionable, new hair style is fashionable, a new kind of clothes is fashionable, and even smoking or drinking is fashionable. So they just try to do something to make themselves look fashionable.
These young people often do something wrong. Some children buy cigarettes and smoke them without letting their teachers or parents know. Some students learn to drink and it costs them a lot of money. Some children want their parents to buy them mobile phones, but they just use their phones to play games and chat with their friends. Some young students like to run after ""fashionable"" stars. They often do their best to see music stars and sometimes they have to go far away to see the stars face to face. They often have to look everywhere for the information of the ""fashionable"" stars.
But many other people don' t think so. They think fashion means everything modern and useful things to people around us. Children should try to be really fashionable.",middle6600.txt
