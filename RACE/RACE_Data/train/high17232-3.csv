3,A,"['Put yourself in a difficult position and meet the challenge.', 'Try your best to be successful in academic performances.', 'Try everything you are interested in and make comparison.', 'Choose a target and insist on it regardless of failures.']",How could you find out what you really love according to Michelle?,"First lady Michelle Obama has some advice for some Tennessee High School graduates: Strike your own path in college and life and work to overcome inevitable difficulties with determination and courage.
The first lady told the 170 graduates that she spent too much of her own time in college focusing on academic achievements. While her success in college and law school led to a high-profile  job, she said, she ended up leaving to focus on public service.
""My message to all of you today is this: Do not waste a minute living someone else's dream,""she said. ""It takes a lot of real work to discover what brings you joy... and you won't find what you love simply by checking boxes or padding your GPA .""
She said the school reminded her of her own high school experience in Chicago. ""My No. 1 goal was to go to a high school that would push me and challenge me,"" she said. ""I wanted to go somewhere that would celebrate achievement. A place where academic success wouldn't make me a target of teasing or bullying, but instead would be a badge of honour."" But Mrs. Obama said pitifully that not all students have the same opportunities. ""Unfortunately, schools like this don't exist for every kid,"" she said. ""You are lucky.""
The first lady told graduates that failure may be a part of their college lives and careers, and that how they respond to any difficulties will define them. ""That's when you find out what you're really made of in those hard times,"" she said. ""But you only do that if you're willing to put yourself a position where you might fall.""
Overcoming difficulties has been the hallmark  of many great people, she said. ""There's this guy Barack Obama... he lost his first race for Congress, and now he gets to call himself my husband."" The first lady joked: ""I could take up a whole afternoon talking about his failures.""",high17232.txt
