2,B,"['She treats her pupils equally.', 'She is inexperienced in her job.', 'She gives poor lessons.', ""She doesn't like Dustin.""]",Which of the following is TRUE about Dustin's teacher?,"With just a few minutes left before school was to start, my six-year-old, Dustin, was crying. ""I don't want to go,"" he said. Ever since he'd entered first grade, he had hated school. What's going on? If he hates school this much now, how bad will it be later on? Every kid sometimes complains about school. But five to ten percent of kids dislike it so much they don't want to attend. ""If a child seems worried or anxious about school, pretends illness to stay home, or refuses to talk about things of the school day, you should be concerned,"" says a school psychologist, Michael Martin.
Fortunately, you can usually solve the problem--sometimes very easily. In our case, my husband and I visited Dustin's class and noticed that the teacher, just out of college, called only on kids who sat right under her nose. Dustin, who often sat near the back, was ignored . We simply told him to move up front. He did, and he was happy again.",high20833.txt
