2,D,"['Net users found their living conditions bad.', 'Net users already had mental problems.', 'Deep relationships were formed through Internet.', 'Net users had less time to communicate with other people.']",Which of the following may be the cause of depression?,"Internet use appears to cause a drop in psychological health, according to a research at Carnegie Mellon University.
Even people who spent just a few hours a week on the Internet experienced more depression   and loneliness than those who used Internet less frequently, the two-year study showed. And it wasn't that people who were already feeling bad spent more time on the Internet, but that using the Net actually appeared to cause the bad feeling.
Researchers are puzzled by the results, which were completely the opposite to their experiences. They expected that the Net would prove socially healthier than television, since the Net allows users to choose the information and to communicate with others.
The fact that Internet use reduces time available for family and friends may explain the drop-in well-being, researchers supposed. Faceless, bodiless ""virtual"" communication may be less psychologically satisfying than actual conversation, and the relationships formed through it may be shallower. Another possibility is that knowing the wider world via the Net makes users less satisfied with their lives.
""But it's important to remember this is not about the technology; it's about how it is used,"" says psychologist Christine Riley of Intel, one of the study founders. ""It really points to the need for considering social factors in terms of how you design applications   and services for technology.""",high15001.txt
