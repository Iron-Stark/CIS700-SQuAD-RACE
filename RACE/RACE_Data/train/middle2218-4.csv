Whenever they go for a walk or for a drive in the car and pass somebody, his uncle waves to the passer-by. Peter is surprised and says, ""Uncle Georage, you seem to know everybody here. Where did you meet them all?""

He goes on his journey with a happier heart. But when I wave to someone who doesn't know me , he is surprised and says to himself, ' Who is that man? Why did he wave to me?' So he has something to think about during the rest of his journey, and that makes his journey seem shorter.So.I.make.everybody.happy.",middle2218.txt
