2,B,"['during the first two days of the program', 'after the exercise named ""Chocolate or Toys""', 'as soon as he came to the program', 'after he left the program some time']",The writer started to change his thinking   _  .,"I used to hate my mother because she worked a lot and didn't spend much time with me. Then one Friday morning I took part in a three-day self-help program for teenagers. Whether you believe it or not, that weekend changed my life.
About 100 other teenagers were there. During the first two days I met a lot of great people. I was glad because I made so many friends there.
On Sunday, the leader did an interesting exercise called ""Chocolate or Toys"". He asked a girl which she liked better, chocolate or toys. She chose chocolate. Then he asked her to choose again between chocolate and chocolate. Of course, she didn't have a choice.
This exercise told us that sometimes we don't have a choice in life, and that sometimes we have to accept something, rather than complaining .
A girl stood up and started talking about her mom who was a drug addict  and how much she hated her mother.
""I want a new mom,"" she cried.
""Unluckily, you can't have one,"" the leader replied.
""You have to accept the mother that you have.""
This hit me hard. I realized that, for better or worse, my mom was my mom. I couldn't choose another mom, but I could try to make the best of the situation.",middle4421.txt
