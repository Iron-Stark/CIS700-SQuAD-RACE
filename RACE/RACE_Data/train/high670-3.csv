3,A,"['there has been an increase in the number of applicants with degrees', 'there has been an increase in the number of jobs advertised', 'jobs are becoming much more complicated nowadays', 'the other processes of applying for jobs are more difficult to do']",The CV has become such an important document because  _  .,"There is a new type of small advertisement becoming increasingly common in newspaper classified columns.It is sometimes placed among ""situations vacant"", although it does not offer anyone a job, and sometimes it appears among ""situations wanted"", although it is not placed by someone looking for a job, either.What it does is to offer help in applying for a job.
""Contact us before writing your application"", or ""Make use of our long experience in preparing your curriculum vitae or job history"", is how it is usually expressed.The growth and apparent success of such a specialized service is, of course, a reflection on the current high levels of unemployment.It is also an indication of the growing importance of the CV, with the suggestion that it may now qualify as an art form in its own right.
There was a time when job seekers simply wrote letters of application.""Just put down your name, address, age and whether you have passed any exams"", was about the average level of advice offered to young people applying for their first jobs when I left school.The letter was really just for openers, it was explained, everything else could and should be saved for the interview.And in those days of full employment the technique worked.The letter proved that you could write and were available for work.Your eager face and intelligent replies did the rest.
