3,D,"['Because people want to have a big meal.', 'Because people want to eat turkey, potatoes and pumping pie.', 'Because people want to get together with their friends and family.', 'Because people want to say ""Thank you"" for the harvest.']",Why people celebrate the Thanksgiving Day?,"In the United States, every year, Thanks-giving Day is on the fourth Thursday in November. Because Canada is on the north of the United States, and is colder, the harvest comes earlier  in the year. In Canada, people have Thanksgiving Day on the second Monday in October.
The harvest brings a lot of food to the people. On Thanksgiving Day people in Canada and America like to have a big meal with their friends and family just like Chinese people do at Mid-autumn festival. Many Canadians and Americans put flowers, vegetables and fruits around their homes to say ""Thank you"" for the harvest. At a Thanksgiving Day dinner, many Canadians and Americans will eat turkey, potatoes, and pumpkin pie. These are food like the food of many years ago. They are saying ""Thank you"" for the harvest that comes every year.",middle1763.txt
