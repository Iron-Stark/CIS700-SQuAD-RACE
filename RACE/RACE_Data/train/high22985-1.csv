         Ocean water is full of salt-- and salt water can hold up more weigh than fresh water. See for yourself!
         You Will Need:
*  3 cups of warm water
*  Measuring cup  
*  Wide-mouthed jar
*  Salt
*  Spoon 
*  Raw  potato
You Will Do:  Pour 1.5 cups      of warm water into the jar.Add 1/3 cup of      salt.Stir  until the      salt is completely dissolved.Add another      1.5 cups of water. Pour it slowly over the back of the spoon into the jar      so that the two liquid will not mix together. Gently      place the potato into the jar. Do not drop it.
What Will Happen:
The potato will sink-- but only halfway!
Why?
Salt water is heavier than fresh water, so it will stay on the bottom. The fresh water will remain on top.
The potato is heavier than the fresh water, but it is lighter than the salt water. That is why the potato will sink halfway down.",high22985.txt
