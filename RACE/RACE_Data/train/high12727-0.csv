0,C,"['It found its bike sales unaffected.', 'It shifted its business to rentals.', 'It saw its bike sales on the rise.', 'It rented more bikes to tourists.']",What happened to Gotham Bikes as a result of the bike--share program?,"New Yorkers are gradually getting used to more bicyclers on those hot blue City Bikes.But what about local bike shops? Is City Bike rolling up riders at their expense? At Gotham Bikes in Tribeca,manager W.Ben said the shop has seen an increase in its overall sales due to the bike-share program.""It's getting more people on the road,""he said.James Ryan,an employee at Danny's Cycles,said City Bike is a good option for people to ease in a city famous for its traffic jams.""They can try out a bike without buying one.""he said.
Rentals are not a big part of the business at either Gotham Bikes or Danny's Cycles.But for Frank's Bike Shop,a small business on Christopher St.,the bike--share program has been bad news.Owner Frank Arroyo said his rental business has decreased by 90% since City Bike was rolled out last month.Arroyo's main rental customers are European tourists,who have since been drawn away by City Bikes.
However,Ben said the bike--share is good for bike sales at his shop.""People have used the bike--share and realized how great it is to bike in the city,then decide that they want something Dicer for themselves,""he noted.Andrew Crooks,owner of NYC Velo,at 64 Second Ave.,said at first he Was concerned about bike--share,though,he admitted,""I was happy to see people on bikes.It seemed like a great idea,but one that would be difficult to implement .""Crooks said he worried about inexperienced riders' lack of awareness of biking rules and strong negative reaction from non--cyclists.However,he said.it's still too early to tell if his business has been impacted.While it's possible that bike--share will cause a drop in business,Crooks thought that the idea was a positive step forward for New York City.",high12727.txt
