4,D,"['Understanding the love of parents', 'Receiving gifts from children', 'Feeling the love inside', 'Expressing your love to your families']",What is the main idea of this article?,"Some time ago I received a gift from both of my children. It had nothing to do with Father's Day. Yet, at the same time it had everything to do with Father's Day.
My son was studying in a high school in Colorado. He lived in the school. While we were talking on the phone he shared some wonderful news with me.
He said, ""You know Dad, I am really happy with my life. I can't think of a thing that I would change about the way that I grew up, or the way that my life is now. ""
My daughter was living with her mother in Northern California at that time. She said almost the same thing to me just a few days later.
Of course, I was delighted to hear this from both of them. And I told them both  how happy I was, not only that they were happy ,but that they expressed it to me.
And that was the gift that they were giving me ---with the heart to communicate. Certainly I hope for good news when I hear from them. But mostly I love that they will share their real feelings with me. Happy or sad, I love to be touched by their real thoughts and feelings.
For a child, Father's Day isn't really about giving Dad a gift. It is about understanding the love that fathers express when they help put food on the table, teach their child to ride a bike, cheer at a soccer game, etc.
For a father, Father's Day isn't so much about receiving gifts for a job well done. Remember, the greatest gift that we give our children is the real expression of our love. It isn't enough for them to feel love inside ourselves: we need to express that love.",middle772.txt
