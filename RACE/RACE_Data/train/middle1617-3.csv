3,B,"['the questions', 'the happiness', 'the popular songs', 'the education']",This passage is mainly about   _  .,"""Are you happy?"" The simple question usually makes people confused  . Even Mo Yan, who won a Nobel Prize, replied to it by saying, ""I don't know.""
When a migrant worker   was asked, ""Are you happy? (Ni Xing Fu Ma?)"" by a CCTV reporter, he looked confused before replying, ""My family name is Zeng. (Wo Xing Zeng.)"" This has become a joke. But his answer showed migrant workers and TV reporters live in different worlds and they cannot even communicate with each other.
Similarly, when asked, ""Are you happy?"" a 73-year-old man, collecting used plastic bottles in a street in Zhejiang, said, ""The bottles can be sold for 0.1 yuan each."" Asked again, he said, ""The government is good."" The reporter went on, ""My question is 'Are you happy?'"" The old man answered, ""My hearing is not good.""
The reporter probably tried to reach the same answer that the interviewees  including the migrant worker and the old man are ""happy"".
In fact, when the question is asked, we should learn about people's true situation and their true wishes and opinions but their ""Yes"" or ""No"".
Luckily, the government has paid more attention to the importance. Now there are many TV programs giving common people the chance to give their opinions.
""Everything we do is aimed at letting people live more happily."" At last year's National People's Congress  , Wen Jiabao said and agreed that increasing happiness would be a top aim for the 12th five-year plan.",middle1617.txt
