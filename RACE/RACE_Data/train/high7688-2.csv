2,C,"['duty-free shops', 'restaurants', 'banks', 'a sauna']","In the Airbus A380, passengers cannot find   _  .","The word's largest aircraft made its public debut last week at Europe's biggest factory, a purpose built assembly line in Toulouse, souther, n France.The Airbus A380 will have 50 per cent more floor space than American rival Boeing's 747 Jumbo, with room for duty-free shops, restaurants and even a sauna.This new arrival is expected to change the face of air travel.
The A380 will enter service in early 2006 with Singapore Airlines.
Airbus claims the A380 will burn less fuel, make less noise, create less pollution and cost 17 per cent less per seat than the 747.It will also reduce traffic problems in the skies.
The aircraft, which cost between PS140 million(US$250m) and PS157 million (US$280m) each compared with PS84 million (US$150m) for Boeing's new Dreamliner jet, is being built at 16 factories in Germany, France, Spain and the UK.
But activists have warned of more noise and pollution from the Superjumbo, while Boeing believes huge aircraft will not be in great demand over the next decade.
As a result, it is putting faith in the much smaller 7E7 Dreamliner.But Airbus is pinning its hopes on the ""big is beautiful"" theory, gambling on size being the key factor in the US-European battle for the skies.
Airbus said it was in talks with half a dozen global airlines about buying the A380. China Eastern Airlines, already an Airbus customer, is said to be targeted, while executives made it plain that they wanted to fight for the Japanese market, which had traditionally been controlled by Boeing.
Over the next 20 years, Airbus hopes to sell 750 of the new planes into a market worth PS185billion (US$330bn).The company already has129 firm orders for the A380, with 52 options.",high7688.txt
