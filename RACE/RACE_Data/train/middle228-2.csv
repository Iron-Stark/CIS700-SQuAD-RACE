One evening, she was giving her small daughter her tea before putting her to bed. First she gave her a piece of bread and butter, but the child said that she did not want it like that. She asked for some jam on her bread as well.
Her mother looked at her for a few seconds and then said, ""When I was a small girl like you. I was always given either bread and butter, or bread and jam, but never bread with butter and jam.""
