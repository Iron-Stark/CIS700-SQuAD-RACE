0,A,"['They have the same ending sound.', 'They have different ending sounds.', 'They must have the same meaning.', 'They must have different meanings.']",What does it mean when two words rhyme?,"Two words rhyme with each other when they have the same ending word, like ""think,"" ""pink"". The last word in each of the lines of a poem does not have to have a rhyming sound, many of them do. Two lines of poetry that rhyme with each other at the end are call rhyming couplet.
Writing rhyming poetry can be difficult because you need to choose words that not only rhyme but have meaning, too. Even though some poems are short, you have to think extra long at which words to choose. Here is an example of a short poem:
He was only a bug, but he was the king.
She smiled at him when he gave her a ring.
He forgot to be careful of one little thing.
His queen was a bee, and she could sting.",high7115.txt
