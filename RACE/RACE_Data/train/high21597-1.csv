       Lillian said today that she is a big fan of the social networking site. ""I love it. It is very exciting. It's a wonderful way of exploring something new. But I must say it's really a waste of time. I'm sure there are lots of other things I should be doing rather than playing on a computer.""
       She has 34 Facebook ""friends"" -- and her most active one is her great grand-daughter Kaylee Lowe, 10.

       Steve said, ""Now and again, she might be surprised at a few of the funny teenage behaviors she sees on Facebook.
       ""But she's pretty tolerant  and it doesn't annoy her. What's great about Grandma is that she's not afraid to take on new things and is always willing to learn -- she's a great inspiration to us all.""",high21597.txt
