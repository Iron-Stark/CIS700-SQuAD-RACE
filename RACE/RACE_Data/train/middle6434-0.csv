The baby eagle liked the nest. It was the only world he had ever known. It was warm and comfortable. Many times each day the mother would _ down from the sky and land in the nest and feed the baby eagle delicious food. She was like a god to him he had no idea where she came from or how she worked her magic.
The baby eagle was hungry all the time, but the mother eagle would always come just in time with the food. The baby eagle grew strong. The mother wanted him to try flying and getting the food out of the nest. But the baby eagle was afraid to do it. The mother eagle flew away and stopped coming to the nest. The baby eagle cried and cried. But there was no one there to hear him. Two days later, the mother eagle appeared at the top of the mountain cliff with a big bowl of delicious food and she looked down at her baby.
The mother said, ""Here is some very delicious food, all you have to do is come to get it.""
""Come to get it!"" said the baby, with much anger. ""How?""
The mother pushed him out of the nest. The ground rushed closer, faster and faster. Something strange happens. He looked down and saw the sky. He wasn't moving towards the ground anymore, his eyes were pointed up at the sun.
""Hug?"" he said. ""What's going on here!""
"" You're flying,"" his mother said.
""This is fun!"" laughed the baby eagle.",middle6434.txt
