1,B,"['To teach in college.', 'To run his own shops.', 'To earn a degree in arts.', 'To work in a big factory.']",What's Mensah's future plan?,"It was on the early afternoon of a mid-October day in 2012. Bismark Mensah, who came to America several months ago, was collecting carts   outside a Walmart in Federal Way. It was a part-time job for him. He earned $9.05 an hour in charge of getting carts out of the parking lot.
He was used to finding stuff in carts that customers had somehow forgotten -- keys, credit cards, wallets. And he turned them into a customer service. But a particular item stood out. It was a white envelope with a clear window in the middle, and there was a lot of cash in it, around $20,000. Mensah turned them into customer services.
Because of what he did that afternoon, Mensah is now the winner of Walmart's national 2013 ""Integrity  in Action Award"".
Bismark Mensah says that since the story ran, he has become the model the youth in Ghana (his native country).
He is now employed full-time at the Federal Way Walmart, earning $10.95 an hour, up from the $9.05 an hour he earned working part-time.
Mensah, 33, no longer collects carts and such. He is in the backroom, dealing with inventory . ""I want to learn everything about operating a store like Walmart store,"" he says. He plans to return to Ghana to run some shops owned by his family. He also plans to go to college and earn a degree in business administration.",high14396.txt
