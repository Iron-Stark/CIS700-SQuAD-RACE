2,D,"['practical', 'acceptable', 'reasonable', 'controversial']","According to the passage, the new Israeli law banning skinny models is  _  .","An Israeli law banning too skinny models went into effect with the start of 2013. The law, approved last March in Israel, requires models to prove they have maintained a Body Mass Index (BMI) of at least 18.5 for three months before a fashion show. That means a woman who is 5'8'' tall can weigh no less than 119 pounds.
""This law is another step in the war against eating disorders,"" said physician Adatto. ""Underweight models,"" he explained, ""can no longer serve as role models for innocent young people who copy their false image of being skinny.""
But some critics in this country say it is misguided, focusing on weight instead of health. They also say the Israeli ban is bound to fail because of the strong power of the fashion industry. ""I think it's an approach that isn't going to work."" Said eating disorder expert Susan Ice, who worked with an organization which creates a healthy working environment for models.
But Adatto told the reporter that he began to concern the issue after meeting an ambitious model who looked like she needed to be hospitalized. He said. ""I realized that only legislation can change the situation. There was no time to waste, so many girls were dieting to death.""
However, the efforts to regulate models' weight in Spain and Italy have not resulted in significant changes in part because of difficulties in determining reliable methods of measuring weight and health.
Still, folks including Ice say there's no denying that images from Hollywood and the fashion industry can be difficult for young women to deal with. ""Certainly I don't believe the modeling industry has caused the rise in eating disorders, but it makes it harder,"" she says. ""It's a difficult recovery environment, worshiping thinness as the beauty ideal.""",high5230.txt
