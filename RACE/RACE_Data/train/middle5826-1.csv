1,D,"['only in doing homework', 'only on sports or music', 'only in working for the public', 'on studies ,sports or music and public work']",A good US student spends his/her time  _  .,"You want to know about my staying in America ,right ? Well ,to tell you the truth ,it is really an eye-opening experience to study here .
In China ,I had English classes five times a week since fifth grade .However ,I didn't know how different textbook English could be from everyday English until I came to Hotchkiss School ,Connecticut .
When I first studied English ,I was told to say ,""I am fine""when people say""How are you ?""But in the US ,I found that people say ,""I am good ""or""I'm tired"".
One day , someone greeted me with ""What's up ?""It made me _ .I thought for a moment and then smiled because I didn't know what to say .
Since then ,I have discovered more and more differences between Chinese  and US cultures .
To my surprise ,US girls spend a lot of time in the burning sun to get a tan .However , in China ,girls try every possible way to get their skin  paler  , or""whiter"".
I was also surprised by how hardworking US students are .
In China ,schoolwork is almost everything ,so we study hard and that's it .But here ,a ""good ""student gets good grades ,does a lot for the public and plays sports or music .
The kids here are so talented  ,I am starting to be sorry that I gave up playing the piano at an early age and that I have never thought about sports .",middle5826.txt
