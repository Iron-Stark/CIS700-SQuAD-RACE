1,C,"['To describe a serious accident.', 'To prove the importance of CPR.', ""To report a 9-year-old girl's brave act."", ""To call people's attention to allergic reaction.""]",Why does the author write the news?,"A schoolgirl saved her father's life by kicking him in the chest after he suffered a serious allergic   reaction which stopped his heart.
Izzy, nine, restarted father Colm's heart by stamping   on his chest after he fell down at home and stopped breathing.
Izzy's mother, Debbie, immediately called 999 but Izzy knew doctors would never arrive in time to save her father, so decided to use CPR.
However, she quickly discovered her arms weren't strong enough, so she stamped on her father's chest instead.
Debbie then took over with some more traditional chest compressions   until the ambulance arrived.
Izzy, who has been given a bravery award by her school, said: ""I just kicked him really hard. My mum taught me CPR but I knew I wasn't strong enough to use hands. I was quite afraid. The doctor said I might as well be a doctor or a nurse. My mum said that Dad was going to hospital with a big footprint on his chest.""
""She's a little star,"" said Debbie, ""I was really upset but Izzy just took over. I just can't believe what she did. I really think all children should be taught first aid. Izzy did CPR then the doctor turned up. Colm had to have more treatment on the way to the hospital and we've got to see an expert.""
Truck driver Colm, 35, suffered a mystery allergic reaction on Saturday and was taken to hospital, but was sent home only for it to happen again the next day. The second attack  was so serious that his airway swelled, preventing him from breathing, his blood pressure dropped suddenly, and his heart stopped for a moment.
He has now made a full recovery  from his suffering.",high9103.txt
