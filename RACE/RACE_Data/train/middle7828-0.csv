My first thought after waking up was that it was pretty cold in my bedroom. Clearly, the power   didn't come back. After I looked out of the window, I felt even sadder: it was still raining heavily. The room was becoming colder and colder. We had no idea when the power would come back, so my wife started a fire in the fireplace.

The snow started. The poor trees now had to carry the heavy snow. The storm seemed to last   and we had nothing to do but stay at home.

The storm stopped this morning, and I drove my car to look for an open store. The trees along the roads were broken.
