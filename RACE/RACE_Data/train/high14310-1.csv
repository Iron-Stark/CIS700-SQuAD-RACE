After two months of learning, Monty, and Porter were able to drive an automobile around a racetrack. ""We wanted to prove how smart rescue dogs are,"" animal behaviorist Mark Vette says. Vette first used voice commands and treats to teach the dogs how to turn a steering wheel and how to change gear .
The dogs' ride only accelerated up to 7.5 miles an hour, and trainers could stop the auto using a remote control.
GOLDEN ZEBRA
Kailua-Kona, Hawaii
Zoe the zebra's markings are special. The animal has white and golden stripes. Zoe's appearance resulted from a rare condition called amelanosis . Her body doesn't make enough melanin, the substance in an animal's skin and hair cells that produces color. ""Only 25 other golden zebras are known to exist in the world,""says Ann Goody, who runs the wildlife refuge where Zoe lives. In the wild, life may be difficult for animals with amelanosis because predators  can easily spot them. But Zoe is protected at her refuge.
COCKATOO MAKES TOOLS
Vienna, Austria
When Figaro the cockatoo spots food lying just out of reach from his cage, he builds a tiny wooden tool to sweep the tasty prize in his way.
The bird first revealed his talent when a stone he was playing with rolled out of his cage. The cockatoo couldn't reach the stone. So he flew away and returned with a small branch, slipping it through the fence to slide the stone toward him.
Wondering if he would do it again, scientists placed a nut exactly where the stone had been. This time, Figaro pulled out a small piece of wood in his cage and dragged the nut toward him.",high14310.txt
