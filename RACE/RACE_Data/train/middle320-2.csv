2,B,"[""Though Liu Yun's mother has AIDS, every teacher still love her."", 'None of teachers love her after her mother has AIDS .', 'Most of teachers love her after her mother has AIDS.', 'Only a few teacher love her when her mother has AIDS.']",Which of the following is TURE?,"Liu Yun, 13, pretty and smart. She is a good student. But many students try to stay from her because Liu Yun's mum has AIDS  and her father has died of AIDS. Luckily, Liu Yun didn't get it.
AIDS means fear for most people. Nobody wants to play games with her. Even a teacher who used to like her turns his back on her now. The biggest problem is how other people look at her. She sometimes wants todrop out of schoolbecause she can no longer face others' indifference . 
It is said if a person has AIDS, it's still safe to eat and play with him. So I think Liu Yun's classmates and teachers are afraid of AIDS because they don't know much about AIDS. And Liu Yun needs their love and understanding. Even a friendly smile means a lot to her.",middle320.txt
