The prefix = st1 /United Statesfederal government had two young men in the state ofTennesseearrested on October 22 on unknown charges.
In court documents published on Monday, it came to light that the men had discussed attacking an African - American school and killing 14 of them.
Another crime was about planning to murder Presidential candidate Barack Obama. According to their affidavits  , the suspects' ""final act of violence"" would be when they attacked Obama while wearing white suits and top hats and driving ""their vehicle as fast as they could toward Obama shooting at him from the windows.""
The two suspects are Paul Schlesselman, 18, of West Helena, Arkansas and Daniel Cowart, 20, of Bells, Tennessee. According to the court papers, they met last month over the Internet through a friend. Schlesselman and Cowart are believed to share ""very strong views"" about White Power.
Schlesselman listed ""being racist"" as his occupation on his MySpace page. He further wrote: ""I'm white. I'm proud. I get angry. I like guns.""
Cowart also had a MySpace page on which photos of guns were presented under a heading of ""My Guns"". On his page he wrote, ""Better to die quick fighting on your feet than to live forever begging on your knees.""
Some have questioned the pair's ability to carry out the charged plan, but authorities have been very concerned about Obama as the first black presidential candidate from a major party.
""We honestly don't know if they had the ability or the skill to carry out the kind of plan that they talked about."" said Malcolm Wiley, of the United States Secret Service in an interview with The New York Times. ""But we take any threat seriously no matter how big or how small it is.""
Cowart and Schlesselman are scheduled to appear before a judge on Thursday.",high23506.txt
