4,B,"['The Biography of Herta Muller', 'Herta Muller Wins Literature Nobel Prize', 'Herta Muller, a Great Successful Romanian Writer', 'The Great Awards Ceremony for Herta Muller']",What's the best title of the passage?,"Herta Muller, the Romanian-born German writer, has won the 2009 Nobel Prize for Literature.The award was announced in Stockholm on Thursday.
         Ms.Muller, 56, immigrated to Germany from Romania in 1987.She is the first German writer to win the Nobel in literature since Gunter Grass in 1999 and the 13th winner writing in German since the prize was first given in 1901.She is the 12th woman to win the literature prize.But unlike previous winners like Doris Lessing and V.S.Naipaul, Ms.Muller is  ly unknown outside of literary circles in Germany.
         ""I am very surprised and still cannot believe it,"" Ms.Muller said in a statement delivered by her publisher in Germany.""I can't say anything more at the moment.""
         She has written some 20 books, but just 5 have been translated into English, including the novels ""The Land of Green Plums"" and ""The Appointment.""
         At the news conference on Thursday at the German Publishers & Booksellers Association in Berlin, where she lives, Ms.Muller, wearing all black and sitting on a leopard-print chair, appeared nervous with all the cameras flashing on her.
         When asked what it meant that her name would now be mentioned in the same breath as German greats like Thomas Mann and Heinrich Boll, Ms.Muller remained philosophical.""I am now nothing better and I'm nothing worse,"" she said, adding: ""My inner thing is writing.That's what I can hold on to.""
         Earlier in the day, at a news conference in Stockholm, Peter England, secretary of the Swedish Academy, said Ms.Muller was honored for her ""very, very distinct special language"" and because ""she has really a story to tell about cruelty and repression in a village much like the one Muller grew up in.""
         The awards ceremony is planned for Dec.10 in Stockholm.As the winner, Ms.Muller will receive about $1.4 million.",high22512.txt
