2,C,"['The global partnership of collecting wild plant species.', 'The temperature condition of the wild plant species in the bank.', ""The government's support for the seed bank project by giving money."", ""Scientists' concern on the extinct wild plant species.""]",Which of the following isn't spoken about in the passage?,"Britain's seed  bank, the only one in the world aiming to collect all of the planet's wild plant species, has reached its goal of banking 10 percent by 2010.
The Millennium Seed Bank Project, run by Kew Gardens--one of the oldest botanical   gardens--will officially place the 24,200th species on Thursday, a pink, wild banana from China.
More than 50 countries are now on board with Kew's giant task but vast places of the globe, including India and Brazil, still need to join in and donate seeds, director Paul Smith said.
The seed bank is one of the largest and most diverse  in the world with more than 1.5 billion seeds. Its goal is to help protect the planet's bio-diversity during a time of climate change.
The wild banana seed is under threat of extinction  in southwest China from agricultural development. It is a vital food source for Asian elephants and important for growing bananas for human eating.
Stored at minus-20 degrees centigrade, so they can last for thousands of years, the seeds await the day that scientists hope never comes--when the species no longer exist in the wild.
It is a race against time, Smith said, because in the last ten years alone, 20 plants held in the bank have already been wiped out in the wild. He estimates that between a third and a quarter will become extinct this century.
""It is pressing and it is happening now. An area, the size of England, is cleared of primary vegetation every year."" Smith said.
Because most of the world's food and medicines come from nature, protecting wild plant species is quite important, scientists say. There are already many other seed banks safeguarding food crops, which only account for 0.6 percent of plant diversity.
For Kew's next goal--to collect a quarter of wild varieties by 2020--the botanists need 10 million pounds a year, or a further 100 million pounds on top of the 40 million they have already been granted.",high2735.txt
