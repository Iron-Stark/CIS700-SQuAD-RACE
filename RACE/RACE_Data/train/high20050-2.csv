""No, I can'  t accept payment for what I did,"" the Scottish farmer replied, waving off the offer. At that moment, the farmer' s own son came to the door of the family hovel . ""Is that your son?"" the nobleman asked. ""Yes, ""the farmer replied proudly.
""I' ll make you a deal. Let me take him and give him a good education. If the boy is anything like his father, he' ll grow to a man you can be proud of.""
