2,D,"['How to surf the internet.', ""Kids shouldn't surf the internet."", 'How to choose online friends.', 'How to protect yourselves online.']",What is the main idea of the passage?,"Never give out identifying information such as Name, Home Address, School name, or Telephone Number in a public message such as at a chat room or on bulletin bards. Never send a person a picture of you without first checking with your parents or guardian.
* Never respond to messages or bulletin board items that are: Suggestive / Obscene / Belligerent / Threatening / Make You Feel Uncomfortable.
* Be careful when someone offers you something for nothing, such as gifts and money. Be very careful about any offers that involve your coming to a meeting or having someone visit your house.
* Tell your parents or guardian right away if you come across any information that makes you feel uncomfortable.
* Never arrange a face-to-face meeting without telling your parents or guardian. If your parents or guardian agree to the meeting, make sure that you meet in a public place and have a parent or guardian with you.
* Remember that people online may not be who they seem. Because you can't see or even hear the person, it would be easy for someone to misrepresent him or herself. Thus, someone indicating that""she""is a""12-year-old-girl""could in reality be an older man.
* Be sure that you are dealing with someone that you and your parents know and trust before giving out any personal information about yourself via E-mail.
* Get to know your""online friends""just as you get to know all of your other friends.",high2216.txt
