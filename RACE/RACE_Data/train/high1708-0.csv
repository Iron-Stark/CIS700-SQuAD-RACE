The Children's Hour
The Children's Hour by Lillian Hellman is a striking play about the power of a lie. Karen Wright (Keira Knightley) and Martha Dobie (Elisabeth Moss) run a girls' boarding school in the 1930s New England. When an angry student starts a rumour that the two headmistresses are having a lesbian   affair, it gradually destroys the women's careers, relationships and lives. The Children's Hour is an upsetting story of cheat, shame and courage.
Banned in London and several cities across America, The Children's Hour received its world opening on Broadway in 1934. Generations on, its exploration of a culture of fear remains remarkably relevant.
Keira Knightley and Elisabeth Moss Star
Keira Knightley, nominee   for Best Actress 2010 Evening Standard Awards for The Misanthrope, returns to the London stage. Knightley starred in Love Actually, The Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy, Pride and Prejudice.
