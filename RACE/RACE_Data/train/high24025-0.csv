0,C,"['Back in Auckland Zoo.', 'In a river nearby.', 'At a house a kilometer away.', 'In the zoo hospital.']",Where was Clyde found after his first escape?,"Clyde, a small-clawed otter, was moved from Auckland Zoo to Wellington Zoo two months ago. The zookeepers hoped he and the other otter Bonnie might start a family together.
But only two days after he arrived, Clyde went missing. He had dug his way under one of the walls and was nowhere to be seen.
The zookeepers set up cages inside the zoo, with plates of Clyde's favorite fish in them, hoping to catch him. Two days went by and still there was no sign of Clyde.
At last a couple saw Clyde at their house --- a whole kilometer away in Newtown. Clyde was hiding in an out-of-reach hole outside their laundry. 
The zookeepers arrived and set up some more traps to try to catch him. But Clyde is a pretty smart otter. Twice he managed to get the fish out of a trap without being caught. 
Five days after he'd escaped, Clyde's days on the run came to an end when he was finally caught in one of the traps. 
It was no good putting Clyde back in his old home---he'd only dig his way out again. So he and Bonnie were put into the zoo hospital. There was no chance of their escaping from there.
Meanwhile, the zookeepers were working hard to make Clyde's old home safer. They put an iron barrier underground to stop him digging their way out. Then Bonnie and Clyde went home again. 
But a month after his first escape, Clyde was out again. Once more the zookeepers came hurrying to catch Clyde. They found him by following the bubbles he made in the river nearby. 
Nobody knew how Clyde had escaped. But this time he was only out for an hour. So---back he went to the hospital again. 
Poor Clyde. It seemed that he wasn't happy at Wellington Zoo, even though he and Bonnie were getting on well together. The keepers didn't like seeing him unhappy, so they planned to look for a home for him somewhere else.",high24025.txt
