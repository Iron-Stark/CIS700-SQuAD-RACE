His wife was surprised ,especially when he climbed up the tree and brought down the fish for her to see.They walked on and soon came to the river. ""I'll just pull in my net and see what I've caught"", the woodcutter said.
He pulled in his net and inside there were several hares . ""How interesting!"" he said ""there are now hares in the river."" After that, they came to where the woodcutter had found the box of gold. ""Look, wife"", he said ""this is what I have found. A box of gold coins.""
