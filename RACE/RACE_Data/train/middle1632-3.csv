3,D,"['The beautiful flowers.', ""Beethoven's life."", 'The blind and The deaf.', 'One kind of Happiness.']",What is the best title of the passage?,"An old man lived in a nice house with a large garden. He took care of his flowers all the time, watering and fertilizing them.
One day a young man went by the garden. He looked at the beautiful flowers, imagining how happy he could be if he lived in such a beautiful place. Then ,suddenly he found the old gardener was blind. He was very surprised about this and asked,""You can't see these flowers. ""Why are you busy taking care of them every day?""
The old man smiled and said ,""I can tell you four reasons. First, I was a gardener when I was young, and I really like this job. Second, although I can't see these flowers, I can touch them. Third, I can smell the sweetness of them. As to the last one, that's you.""
""Me? But you don't know me.""said the young man.
""Yeah, it's true that I don't know you. But I know that flowers are angels that everybody knows. We enjoy the happiness these flowers have brought us.""
The blind man's work opened our eyes and pleased our hearts, which also made his life happier. It was just like Beethoven, who became deaf in his later life and wrote many great musical works. Beethoven himself couldn't hear his wonderful music, but his music has encouraged millions of people to face their difficulties bravely. Isn't it a kind of happiness?",middle1632.txt
