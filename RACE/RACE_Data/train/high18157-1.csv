 Before the Second World War, most people lived in the town or the city where they worked.
 Almost everyone either walked to work or used a good inexpensive transportation system  Many of
 these systems were electrified and ran on tracks, so they used very little energy.
      After 1945, the US government built many new roads and highways. People moved farther
and farther form the cities where they worked because they could drive their cars on these new
 roads from their suburban homes to work in the city. Some of the big car makers also bought the
 electrified transportation systems and destroyed them. As people stopped using public
 transporation , cities spent less money fixing old buses and trains or buying new ones. Public
 transportation got worse and worse.
      In the late 1960s, people found out that the increase in the use of cars led to many
 problems. There were always too many cars for the highway system, and terrible traffic problems
 developed. People were spending hours in traffic jams getting to and from work every day. In
 addition, the air in many cities became dirty because of pollution from millions of cars, and many
 people died in traffic accidents. As people began to get worried about how the use of cars was
 hurting the environment,  cities began to spend more money on public transportation again,  so
 fewer people would have to drive cars.
      When gas became very expensive in the mid-1970s, the number of people taking public
transportation  began to increase .It's terribly expensive to build new public transportation systems.
so it's very difficult to make big changes in the way people travel .However ,an increase in the
use of public transportation has begun.",high18157.txt
