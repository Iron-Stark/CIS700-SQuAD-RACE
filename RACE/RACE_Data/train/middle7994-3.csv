3,C,"['good study habits', 'other things', 'your homework', 'mistakes']",You must only think about   _  when you study.,"All students need to have good study habits .When you have good study habits, you learn things quickly. You also remember them easily.
Do you like to study in the living room? This is not a good place because it is usually too noisy. You need to study in a quiet place, like your bedroom. A quiet place will help you only think about one thing.
When you study, don't think about other things at the same time. Only think about your homework. If you do this, you will do your homework more quickly and you will make fewer mistakes.
Good study habits are very important. If you do not have them, try to learn them. If you are already good, try to make them better.",middle7994.txt
