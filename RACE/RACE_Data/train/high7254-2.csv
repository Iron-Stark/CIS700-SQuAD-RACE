Years ago, as a young mom with two small children, I struggled to keep up with the demands of a busy life. One day, I woke up feeling so tired that I knew something had to change! A friend gave me some Royal Jelly--an amazing substance from the beehive .I was doubtful, but desperate...so I tried it! In time, I began to experience renewed energy like never before! Now, over two decades later, I travel all round the country, sharing my lifechanging experience. I'm grateful for the energy to keep up and love to share this wonderful discovery with others.

Ten years ago, when I was 73, my mind wanted to be busy and useful, but my body didn't. I became very tired. That's when my daughter Madeline tried to persuade me to try her special Royal Jelly. It made great difference in her life, so she was sure it could help me too! Hesitating for 2 days, I gave in. She was right! I no longer felt worn out. I had a new, youthful eagerness for life and I've been OK--thanks to Royal Jelly!

When my mom Madeline was introduced to Royal Jelly, it affected my life, too! Mom gave me some of her fantastic Royal Jelly. Boy, things did turn around! I had more energy and _ and was finally able to keep up with high school and, eventually, college activities. Today, I'm a busy mom in my mid thirties with two active boys and a new business! I have enough energy to do it all! I'm glad I took my Mom's advice.",high7254.txt
