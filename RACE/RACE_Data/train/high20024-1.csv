1,B,"['Chocolate bars', 'Coffee drink', 'Chocolate pudding', 'Cocoa drink']",Which of the following might NOT be considered a product made from cocoa beans?,"A study of older men in The Netherlands, known for its delicious chocolate, showed those who ate the same amount of one-third of a chocolate bar every day had lower blood pressure and a reduced risk of death.
The researchers say, however, it's too early to conclude that it was the chocolate that led to better health. The men who ate more cocoa products could have eaten other food that made them healthier. Experts also point out that eating too much chocolate can make you fat -- a risk for both heart disease and high blood pressure.
""It's why too early to make recommendations about whether people should eat more cocoa or chocolate,"" said Brian Buijsse, an expert for nutrition at prefix = st1 /WageningenUniversityin The Netherlands, who co-authored the study.
Still, the Dutch Study, supported by grants   from the Netherlands Prevention Foundation, appears to be the largest so far to document a health effect for cocoa beans. And it confirms findings of smaller, shorter-term studies that also linked chocolate with lower blood pressure.
Researchers examined the eating habits of 470 healthy men who were not taking blood pressure medicine. The men who ate the most products made from cocoa beans -- including cocoa drinks, chocolate bars and chocolate pudding -- had lower blood pressure and a 50 percent lower risk of death.
""This is a very important article providing epidemiological support for what many researchers have been observing is experimental models,"" said Cesar Fraga of the University of California Davis, who does similar research but was not involved in the new study.
Could the study results apply to women?
""Our study consisted of elderly inch,"" Buijsse said. ""If you look at the other studies, you will see the same effects in men and women, younger people and older people. The findings may be  _ to women, but you never know.""",high20024.txt
