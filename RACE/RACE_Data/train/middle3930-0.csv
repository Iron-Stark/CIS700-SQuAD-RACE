0,D,"['turns a good day to a bad day', 'makes one person affect another', 'turns bad things into good things', 'gets one event to cause other similar events to happen']","According to the passage, the ""domino effect"" is an effect that  _  .","Bad days happen to us all. Often a day that starts out bad just continues to get worse. Sometimes there's a ""domino effect "" with bad events. For example, you sleep through the alarm, so you're stressed. And you will sit in the bad traffic, which will also make you late for work, etc.
How can we turn a bad day to a good day? Here are some ideas that have worked for me:
Smile a lot
Smiling a lot will help you feel relaxed. Research has shown that smiling produces three useful chemicals which make us feel good.
Talk to a good friend
Keeping bad or unhappy things in your mind is not a good idea. Talking to someone who cares and listen really does help us feel better, too.
Concentrate on your good things
It's hard to concentrate on how bad things are when you're concentrating on how good things are! Think of 10 or more things you're thankful for, and you'll achieve a whole new outlook  on your day.
Get some exercise
If you can, go for a walk. Exercising will help you feel better. Excising can get your day back to be normal again.
Make the day a challenge
If you make yourself think of the day as a challenge, you'll start to do all the things you can to make your day better.
