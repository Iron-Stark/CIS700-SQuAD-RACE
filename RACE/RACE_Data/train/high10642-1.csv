1,D,"['20', '11', '12', '24']",Saddam Hussein led Iraq for  _  years.,"""Ladies and gentlemen,we got him!""
With those words,Paul Bremer,the US's top administrator in Iraq,told the world that Saddam Hussein had been caught.
Saddam was found last Saturday night hiding in a hole on the land of his former cook.He had a gun with him when he was found by US soldiers,but did not use it.He also had US $750 000.""He was quite cooperative .Not one shot was fired,""said Richardo Sanchez,the US's top army official in Iraq.
Saddam Hussein was the leader of Iraq from 1979 to April 2003.In 1990,he went to war with Kuwait ,one of Iraq's neighbours.Iraq's army killed many Kurds living there.The US and other countries went to war with Iraq in 1991 to get the Iraq army out of Kuwait.The war was won quickly by the American-led army.But Saddam was left to lead Iraq.
In 2003,America said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and decided to go to war with Saddam again.
The US-led army occupied Iraq in April.But they could not find Saddam.Saddam had around 30 hiding places in the country and he moved among them every four hours.The US-led army only found him after being told where he was by one of his former workers.
America and Britain now want to put Saddam on trial for ""war crimes "",such as killing Kurds in the 1990s.
George W.Bush,the US President,wants Saddam to ""pay the ultimate penalty "" for such crimes.By that,he means the death penalty.The UN and European countries,though,do not want Saddam to be put to death.",high10642.txt
