2,B,"[""the IOE 's researches were suspected"", 'mixed school is a better choice for boys', 'boys are better in academic performance than girls', 'mixed schools are good to boys in terms of socialization only']","According to the passage, Mary Boust suggests that   _  .","Research by the Institute of Education (IOE) in London found that men who went to single-sex schools were not only more likely to be separated from a partner or divorced, but also more likely to be depressed by middle age.
The chances of women having successful marriages were not affected by whether they were educated in mixed or single-sex schools.Separate research by the IOE found that going without boys was beneficial for women in other ways since there was a "" statistically significant positive association between single-sex schooling and wages for women"".
The study into marital success interviewed 17,000 adults who were taught in a range of schools including private boarding schools to state comprehensives.It found that single-sex education does not compromise the chances either of men or women of getting married.
However, researchers found that boys educated on their own were more likely to divorce in later life.While for women, there was no significant link.The research also found men taught in boys' schools were more likely to suffer from depression by age 42--perhaps because of their increased chances of marital breakdown.But Professor Leonard's team was unable to identify why those men educated in a single-sex environment were more likely to divorce.
The study asked married and  _ g couples where men had attended both single-sex and mixed schools to rate how happy they were and found no marked difference in their happiness levels or willingness to share domestic chores.
Mary Boust, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said the IOE research confirmed what was always suspected.""All the research shows single-sex schools are good for girls but bad for boys--both in terms of academic performance and socialization,"" she said.""Boys learn better when they are with girls and they actually learn to get on better."" The findings were presented at a conference on gender in education hosted by Perse School for Girls in Cambridge.",high21890.txt
