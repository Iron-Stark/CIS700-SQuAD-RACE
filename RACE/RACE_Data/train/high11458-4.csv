4,A,"['To be good to people is more important than to be good-looking.', 'To be good-looking is very important.', 'If you want to make yourself good-looking, you must be good to people.', 'If you often help people, you will become more and more beautiful.']",What can we learn from this story?,"Once there was a man who had two children, a boy and a girl. The boy was good-looking but the girl was not.
One day they found a mirror for the first time and they saw what they looked like. The boy was very pleased and he said to his sister, ""How handsome I am! I look much nicer than you!""
The girl did not like what her brother said and gave him a hard push.
""Go away!"" she said.
Their father saw what was happening. He went up to them and said to the boy,
""You must always BE good as well as LOOK good.""
Then to the girl he said, ""My dear, if you help everyone and do your best to please him, everyone will love you. It does not matter that you are not as good-looking as your brother.""",high11458.txt
