1,C,"['people may be asleep', ""people can find you easily'"", 'there is less smoke down there', 'you should look after your things carefully']",You should keep down next to the floor because  _,"Fire can be very dangerous. We should be careful with it. This is what to do in a fire:
*Shout out. Shout as loudly as you can, because people may be asleep.
*Call 119. Don't try to put out the fire yourself. Tell 119 where you are and what is on fire.
*Keep down next to the floor. There is less smoke down there, so it's easier to breathe and see where you are going.
*Test the door. If the door is cool, open it carefully. If the door is hot, do not open it! Try to find a different way out.
*Get out. Do not stop to pick up anything. A fire can become very big in a few seconds!
*Don't use the lift. Always use the stairs .The lift may go wrong and keep you inside.
*Don't go back. Even if your pet is still inside, do not go back for it Animals have a very good sense of smell. They often get away from buildings before people.",middle3348.txt
