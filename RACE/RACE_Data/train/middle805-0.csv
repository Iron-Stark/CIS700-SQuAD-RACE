0,D,"['in a rainy day', 'in the afternoon', 'on a cloudy morning', 'at a bus stop']",The story happened  _  .,"It was a beautiful spring morning. There wasn't a cloud in the sky, and the sun was warm but not too hot. Mr. White saw an old man at the bus stop with a big and black umbrella in his hand.
Mr. White said to him, ""Do you think it's going to rain today?""
""No,"" said the old man, ""I don't think so.""
""Then are you carrying the umbrella because the sun is too hot?""
""No, the sun is not very hot in spring.""
Mr. White looked at the big umbrella again, and the man said, ""I am old man, and my legs are not very strong. I must have a walking-stick. But people will say, 'Look, the man is so old, and I don't like that.' When I carry an umbrella in fine weather, people only say, 'look at that stupid man.'""",middle805.txt
