0,A,"[""you should consider others' response before you act assertively"", 'you should be assertive if you want to get good marks', ""assertiveness is the ability to infringe others' rights."", 'assertive behavior will bring you bad feelings']",The writer probably agrees that  _  .,"Assertiveness is the ability to confidently express your opinions, feelings,attitudes, and rights, in a way that doesn't infringe  the rights of others.
Many of us are taught that it is not nice to consider our own needs above those of others. If someone says or does something that we don't like, we should just be quiet and try to stay away from that person in the future.
Why is Assertiveness important?
If you don't know how to be assertive, you might experience:
*Depression - Anger, a sense of being helpless, hopeless, or of having no control over your life.
*Resentment - Anger at others for taking advantage of you.
*Frustration - Why did I allow that to happen?
Most people find it easier to be assertive in some situations than in others. This makes perfect sense. It's a lot easier to hold your ground with a stranger than with someone you love. But the more important the relationship is to you, the more important it is to be assertive. Assertive behavior leads to increased respect from others!
But before you decide to act assertively, you have to decide if you can live
with the results. Although assertive behavior usually will result in a positive
response   ,some people  might react differently.
How to be effectively  assertive:
*Use ""I"" statements. Keep the focus on the problem you're having. ""I'd like to be able to tell my stories without interruption."" instead of ""You're always interrupting my stories ! ""
*Use facts, not opinions. ""Did you know that shirt has a hole?"" instead of ""You're not going out looking like THAT, are you?""
*Express ownership of your thoughts, feelings, and opinions. ""I get angry when he breaks his promises. "" instead of ""He makes me angry. ""
* Make clear and direct requirements. Don't invite the person to say no. ""Will  you please?"" instead of 'Would you mind...?"" or ""Why don't you...?""
*Keep repeating your point. Use a low level and pleasant voice. Don't try to explain yourself.",middle1766.txt
