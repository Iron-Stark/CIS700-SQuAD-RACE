0,A,"['The first one.', 'The second one.', 'The last one.', 'None of them.']",Which equipment does the writer like best ?,"I went to technology _ where people were showing their ideas for better learning. At the show I got a chance to try out lots of new, interesting equipment that might be introduced to schools. I thought some of it were great and would make learning more fun.
Cyber Coach Mat
The first thing I tried was the Cyber Coach Mat. This allows children to learn things like yoga  and tai chi  with virtual instructors . Also you can play football or have dance battles on it.
Sony PSP
The second piece of equipment I tried was the Play Station Portable. or PSP. It lets you access  lots of education materials and helps learning in many ways. It's really fun and even has a built-in camera and video so you can have fun with friends.
Lego NXT
The final thing I tried was the Lego NXT. This involves  building a robot and programming it to follow instructions .
The robot can pick up sound waves which can then be sent to the computer or a phone. I would really like to do this kind of thing in my lesson!
Overall the fair was great and I learn how to use a lot of things that I think could really help children to learn and have fun at the same time.
My favourite was the Cyber Coach Mat because it allows you to learn new skills and it""s a great way to do a PE lesson if it's cold and raining outside!",middle5441.txt
