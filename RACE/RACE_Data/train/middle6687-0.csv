The name of the holiday means ""hallowed"" because it happens the day before All Saints Day.
Before the festival, people paint homes, shops and classrooms in the traditional Halloween colours, orange and black. Some people make costumes and masks at home. Some people buy them in shops. People also make decorations  for the festival. These decorations look like witches, black cats, ghosts, skeletons and jack-o-lanterns. Jack-o-lanterns are pumpkins that are cut to look like faces.
People think that Halloween is the children's New Year's Eve. They dress up in special costumes and masks. They eat too much, and go to bed too late celebrating. They go from one door to another saying ""trick or treat"". People give them candies, cookies, fruit or money.
Adults and older children also celebrate Halloween with parades , festivals and costumes parties. One kind of the parties welcomed by children is dunking for apples. Apples are put in tubs  full of water. People try to get the apples using only their months; they cannot use their hands.",middle6687.txt
