How are you? Are you still coming to my birthday party in January? My family, friends and classmates are all coming. The party is on Monday, January 13 at 6:00. It's at Uncle Tom's restaurant in the city. First, we can eat and talk from 6:00 to 7:45. After that we can go to a movie in ZJG Shopping Park near Zhonglian(GDH) International Hotel. Every Monday, there's a movie on at 8:00. I hope you can come. You can meet my other friends and my sisters, too.
