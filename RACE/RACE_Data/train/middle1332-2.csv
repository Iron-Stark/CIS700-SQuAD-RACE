2,D,"['Some pictures and a map', 'Some books and an eraser', 'A clock and a pencil', 'A clock and some books']",_  are on the desk.,"Dear Anna,
It is nice to see the photo of your room. Here is a photo of my room. These are my bed and my desk. My clock and some books are on the desk. Sometimes the books are on the bed. I like _ books on the bed. Oh, that is my hat on the bed. It is yellow. My quilt is yellow, too. My schoolbag is on the sofa. It is green. I take  it to school every day.
Yours,
Mona
