1,D,"['bad news traveled quickly and good news slowly', 'few people cared about events that took place in far away countries', 'kings and rulers were often overthrown or killed', 'news was passed from one person to another']","Before the time of the newspaper,   _","Almost every family buys as least one copy of a newspaper every day. Some people subscribe to as many as two or three different newspapers. But why do people read newspapers?
    Five hundred years ago,news of important happenings--battles lost and won,kings or rulers overthrown  or killed--took months and even years to travel from one country to another. The news passed by word of mouth and was never accurate. Today we can read in our newspapers of important events that occur in far away countries on the same day they happen.
  Apart from supplying news from all over the world,newspapers give us a lot of other useful information. There are weather reports, radio, television and film guides, book reviews, stories, and of course, advertisements. The bigger ones are put in by large companies to bring attention to their products. They pay the newspapers thousands of dollars for the advertising space, but it is worth the money, for news of their products goes into almost every home in the country. For those who produce newspapers, advertisements are also very important. Money earned from advertisements makes it possible for them to sell their newspapers at a low price and still make a profit.",high22378.txt
