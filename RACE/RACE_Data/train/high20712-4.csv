4,D,"['he might be very surprised', 'he must be very sad', 'he was very much worried', 'his mind was set at rest']","When the shoemaker received the writer's telephone call,   _  .","After moving to a small town, I took several pairs of shoes to the shoemaker to be fixed. Within a week I picked them up and put them away in my closet.
Four months later my husband and I were invited out to dinner. I unboxed a pair of high heels . I hadn't worn them since they were repaired. I put one shoe on my right foot, and then I put the other on my left. I took both shoes off for a closer look. They were exactly the same style, color1 and size, but each was for the right foot.
I was puzzled, since I had worn the shoes on several occasions and knew I hadn't worn two right shoes. Then I thought of the shoemaker. Although I was sure he wouldn't remember me after such a long time, I telephoned him and explained to him the trouble I had.
""Thank goodness you finally called!"" he was nearly shouting, ""An angry woman with two left shoes has been bothering for months!""",high20712.txt
