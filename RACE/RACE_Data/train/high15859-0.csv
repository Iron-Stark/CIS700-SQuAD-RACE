The fire was discovered around 4 o'clock at a three-story home in the South Quincy Street on the city's east side. Investigators  say 68-year-old Mary Taylor lives there with her two dogs.
""I got out of bed and went to the front window and could hear somebody was yelling ,'Fire!'"" Curt Dworak said.When he realized what was happening, he threw on some clothes and ran to help. ""I was just hoping Mary wasn't in there,
,so I just reacted,"" he said, ""I just broke the glass and then went in through the window.""
Dworak yelled for Mary but got no response. As he searched,the fire grew and debris  started falling around him. I didn't know what to do. I yelled for her a couple more times,and then I heard her. Disoriented and unable to move, Mary was sprawling  on the floor in the back of her house,so Dworak picked her up and carried her to safety.
Dworak, who has been
as a hero by Green Bay Fire Department but shrugged of the praise,said,""They would have done the same thing. Mary is a nice lady,and how could you live with yourself if you didn't do something like that?""
Mary was up and talking before she was taken to the hospital to be checked out. Dworak escaped without a thin cut.",high15859.txt
