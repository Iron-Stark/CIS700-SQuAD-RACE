0,A,"['9 months.', '10 months.', '7 months.', '6 months.']",Whats the longest time the snow can last in Finland?,"Finland lies in the north of Europe, and has Russia to the east. It is two different places in winter and summer. Summers there are fairly dry and hot, although by August things can already begin to get cold and unpleasant. Of course, winters are cold, but the cold is dry. In most parts snow comes in October and clears by the end of March, but in the northern parts snow can fall as early as September and stay until late May.
The tourist season in southern Finland is from early June to late August. This is when all the tourist attractions and summer programs are open, with steamboats and ferries   traveling on the lakes and rivers, and festivals become very lively. Finnish holidays are from the summer high season in late June to the end of July. This is the time period of nights with sunlight, when Finland doesnt seem to sleep.
The tourist season in northern Finland is different. Mosquitoes can be annoying in July, but September is lovely with its autumn colors. October, February and March are good times to visit the north of Finland to view the aurora borealis  , and enjoy winter activities such as skiing and dog sledding. The Christmas holiday period is also one of the best times in Finland --after all, this is the ""official"" home of Santa Claus. Helsinki, the capital of Finland, is popular all year round.",high10169.txt
