3,A,"['Hitler wanted to be the father of the children.', 'The boy was both clever and courageous  .', 'Rembruant was a great painter.', 'Hitler did not like Jews.']",Which of the following statements is NOT true?,"It was several years since Adolf Hitler came into power in Germany. And now his army was marching into some parts of Europe. He must be in the prime of his career.
One day Hitler went to an exhibition where the works of school children were on show. He seemed to have great interest in the exhibits--inventions as well as carvings, drawings. After having walked around the hall and examined everything, he said he was ready to meet the young artists. And soon a group of children came into the room to salute(-----) him.
""Well, well. You did very good work."" nodded Hitler in satisfaction. ""I promise on my honor I'd satisfy you with whatever you want. What'd you wish to be if I were your father?""
""A sailor sailing the sea."" one of the boys answered.
""Good. I'll have you join my navy and some day you will rule the oceans.""
""Ask for anything? What'd you wish to be if I were your father?"" he asked a second boy.
""A painter as great as Rembruant.""
""Good. You are to be sent to the Fine Art School and surely you will make an even greater painter.""

""An orphan(the child who has no parents)."" he murmured.",high15966.txt
