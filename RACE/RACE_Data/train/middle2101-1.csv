1,D,"['often play with me', 'often play football in my house', 'often come to my house', 'sometimes break my windows']",The boys   _  .,"Now children can do many nice things after school. They can read books, ride bikes, watch TV and play games. But boys like playing ball games best.
The children near my door often play football in the garden, and sometimes they break  my windows. One Saturday afternoon I stay at home and read a book. After a few minutes, I close my eyes and go to sleep. Suddenly  a sound  at the door wakes me up. Soon a little boy comes in.
"" Not one of my windows again?""
"" Oh, no!"" answers the boy. "" Your window is open this time and our ball is in your bedroom. May I get it, please?""",middle2101.txt
