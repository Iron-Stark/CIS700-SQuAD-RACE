0,B,"['Zyban tablets.', 'Nicotine patches.', 'Nicotine inhalers.', 'Nicotine nasal spray.']",Which of the following medicines can be bought without a prescription?,"There are some strong-minded people that are able to stop smoking today and be free from the addiction the next day. However, some smokers may have to seek help from medication   in order to kick the habit.
     What medication actually does is to reduce the wish to smoke. Some of the medication must be taken with a doctor's guidance. The five most common medications to stop smoking are Bupropion SR, nicotine gum, nicotine inhalers, nicotine nasal spray and nicotine patches. People can buy nicotine gum and nicotine patches in chemists. However, the other medications require a prescription.
     Zyban tablets have been found to be highly effective in curing people of smoking addiction. The tablet needs to be taken whole, without crushing  it, as crushing can lead to side effects. It can be bought on the prescription of a doctor.
     Nicotine patches are filled with nicotine and they are applied to the skin. The skin takes in the nicotine and carries it to the blood stream. The amount of nicotine in these patches is quite limited, not enough to lead to addiction. But you shouldn't take them for dinner. In fact, millions of people have benefited from these nicotine patches.
     Nicotine gum is supposed to be a safer choice. It is used in such a way that it comes into contact with the blood vessels   in the mouth and then releases the nicotine. The nicotine should not go through the stomach; otherwise, it may cause certain side effects.
     These different types of medications have to be taken quite carefully. Do ask your doctor before taking any of these.",high22548.txt
