3,B,"['The Movies about Wang Baoqiang', 'Pursuing Dreams', 'How to Become Famous', 'Overnight Well-known']",What would be the best title for this passage?,"Some years ago, Wang Baoqiang was a nobody to most Chinese people. However, he is now a household film star in China.
Wang is the youngest child of a poor family in Hebei Province. Dreaming of becoming an actor, he left home at the age of 8 to study kung fu at Shaolin Temple, since kung-fu actors seemed to appear most often on the big screen.
At 14, he moved to Beijing for his acting career for the first time, with little money in his pocket. He worked at a construction site for 20 to 25 yuan per day, and spent his free time standing in front of the Beijing Film Studio, eager to be chosen as temporary actors. This was the hardest time for the boy. His opportunity finally came one day after he went for a role in the movie ""Blind Shaft"" . He was chosen to play a young coal miner. The movie won him three prizes in Thailand, France and Taiwan. But his success didn`t make any difference to his life.
That year, he went home for the Spring Festival. He gave his family his earnings from the movie, around $ 250 and then returned to Beijing with 500 yuan, the same amount he had when he first came to the city. His life was as simple as before.
Thanks to his natural performance in ""Blind Shaft"", he was invited by the famous director Feng Xiaogang to act in the film ""A World Without Thieves"" in 2004, which made him famous immediately. People called him ""Shagen"", the name of his character in the movie.
Wang's work, ""Soldiers Sortie"" has made him the most popular actor on the Chinese mainland. For the actor, it's a dream coming true.
""Dreams come true. I think my life is exactly a course of pursuing dreams. No matter how tough one thing is,I can make it as long as I put great effort into it. ""he said.",high12685.txt
