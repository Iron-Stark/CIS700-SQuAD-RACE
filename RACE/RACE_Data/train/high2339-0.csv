Centerville High School Essay Contest
Rules
1. Students are asked to submit essays of 500 to 700 words of their own work. Any essay containing material plagiarized  from another source will be disqualified.
2. Manuscripts should be typed double-spaced, with the student's name, address, and grade level on a separate sheet of paper.
3. Essays must be turned in by 4:00 p.m. on November 30. They can be brought to Mrs. Elton in Room 104 or to Mr. Markham in the school library.
Essay-Writing Tips
1. Catch your readers' interest-Your opening should immediately pull your readers into your essay. Asking a question or starting with an anecdote, quotation, or surprising statement are some good ways to do this.
2. Create a picture-Use active words that show your readers what is happening. Instead of telling your readers vaguely that ""the room was disordered,"" paint a picture using active verbs and lively adjectives.
3. Have a purpose-Well-written essays do more than just describe an incident or express a viewpoint, they also communicate a message.
4.Check for mistakes-Read your paper over to check for mistakes. Ask another student to read your paper and make suggestions. Another pair of eyes will often spot a mistake you've overlooked.
5. Format your essay-Neatly type your essay on white paper. Choose an attractive cover for submission. The computer lab will be open after school from 3:15 to 4:45 p.m. each day this month so that students can use the computers.
