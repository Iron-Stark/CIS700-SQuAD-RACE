She was hardworking and had a special skill in making delicious strawberry jam.
Aunt Fanny was single and had no children. She didn't like to share love with others. I thought she was very lonely, although she didn't mind it. She had a workshop where my mother helped her make the best strawberry jam, and everyone in our town bought it. But aunt Fanny asked my mother not to tell the recipe  of making the strawberry jam to others.
When the strawberries were ripe, my family would pick them together. We talked and laughed, experiencing the fun of picking strawberries. But aunt Fanny never joined us. She just asked us to pick strawberries quickly and make more strawberry jam to make more money for her. Each person in our town said that she just paid attention to money rather than anything else. What a poor woman! It's no use having too much money because she had no family and friends to share her happiness during her lifetime.
Maybe it was the recipe that brought success to aunt Fanny. But to me, it was just a common recipe. Money can make you feel rich for a while, but it is the beautiful days spent with family and friends that truly make you _ .",middle7008.txt
