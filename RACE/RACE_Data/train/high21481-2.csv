In any case, I drew pen and ink animals and landscapes much influenced by Krenkel and St. John for five years.
       For some strange reason, I had been waiting until my retirement to start doing watercolor1s again, but as soon as I walked out of the school door for the last time I picked up my brushes and rediscovered Andrew Wyeth, who quickly became my favorite artist, I had looked through all the art books I had on my shelves and found his watercolor1s to be the closest to how I thought good watercolor1s should look.
