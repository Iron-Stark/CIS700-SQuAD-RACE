2,B,"['Critical', 'Objective', 'Supportive', 'Uninterested']",What attitude does the author hold towards home tutoring?,"On the whole, it's not something we parents shout about, but one in four of us does it. Hiring private tutors for our children is now widespread.
""It's expensive, but worth it,"" says Ashan Sabri, whose daughter Zarreen, is having tuition in biology and chemistry in preparation for A-levels this summer. ""My husband and I tried to tutor her at home, but we found all our knowledge was out of date and we were only confusing Zarreen. We also tried a group revision course but all the children were sitting in a room for different kinds of exams. On the whole, we think one-to-one tuition works best.""
The real reason is: does tutoring do any good?
""It's not the _ ,"" says Professor Judith Ireson, author of a 2005 Institute of Education report on the subject. ""It's still up to the child to do the learning. If he or she isn't interested, sending them to a private tutor won't do any good. However, we did find that students who had private tuition in mathematics during the two years before GCSE achieved on average just under half a grade higher than students who did not have a tutor.""
In which case, surely it's time to break open the champagne? Not necessarily, says Elaine Tyrrell, head of The Rowans School, Wimbledon, a preparation school which regularly gets children into the best private schools.
""While we recommend private tutoring for a few children whose first language isn't English, we don't encourage it for the others. With the level of education they get here, children really ought to be able to pass the entrance exams without any extra teaching. And our worry is that they might just get used to getting help from last-minute tutoring, but, once they actually get to that school, they won't be able to cope.""
But Mylene Curtis, owner of Fleet Tutors, one of the biggest tutoring agencies in the country, holds a different view.
""In some respects, the hurdles children have to leap in order to get into these schools are set at a higher level than the reality,"" says Curtis. ""We often find that, once a child has got into a school, the standard of work isn't as high as was feared. The trick is to do well enough in the exam to win a place.""",high11234.txt
