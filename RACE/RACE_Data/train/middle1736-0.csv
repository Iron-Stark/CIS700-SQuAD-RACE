0,A,"['a friend', 'lip salve', 'a computer', 'chili con carne']","To Adrian Fernandez,  _  is the most important.","Food or friends? Lip salve   or iPod? What is the most important thing in the US teenagers' lives today? Let's take a look.
Some find that they can't do without people.
""My biggest need is my friends. Without them, I wouldn't do much,"" said Adrian Fernandez, a 14-year-old boy.
With others, food always comes first.
""I do not think that I could live without chili con carne  . I eat it every day. And if I didn't have it, it's all I would think about,"" said Max Wu, an 8th-grade boy.
Sometimes, the things teenagers can't do without are strange.
Take 14-year-old girl Hannah Sacchini for example. ""I cannot live without lip salve, especially in winter,"" said Hannah Sacchini. ""I go mad if my lips get dry.""
Of course, today everybody uses mobile phones and computers. Some teens can't live without these high-tech   things.
Justin Beck, a 15-year-old boy, feels like this: ""I would not be able to live without my iPod. I use it for so many different things. I always have it with me,"" he said.
So, now we know the things US kids really must have. What about you and your classmates? What can't you live without?
