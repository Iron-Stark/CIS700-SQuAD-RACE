1,C,"['A ""back-to-school sale"".', 'A ""midnight madness"" event.', 'An ""early bird special"" sale.', 'A ""buy one, get one free"" sale.']",What do we call the sale if it starts before the sun rises?,"There are many kinds of sales. For example, a ""back-to-school sale"" is held near the beginning of the school year. Parents like the lower prices of the clothes and school supplies for their children.
A ""midnight madness"" event starts very late at night. An ""early bird special"" sale starts very early in the morning. This kind of sale is popular the day after Thanksgiving in November.
A favorite sale among many people is the ""buy one, get one free"" sale. You buy one thing and get a second one without cost. When people see the word ""free"" in an advertisement they know they are getting a good deal. As a matter of fact, it is not the case.
Another kind of sale is a ""going out of business"" sale. This is when a storeowner tries to sell all the goods in the store before closing the business permanently .
Let us say the store sells floor coverings. The owner lowers the prices and puts up a sign that says: ""Going out of business sale. All items MUST be sold by tomorrow.""
People who buy the floor coverings think they are getting a special deal because everything must be sold in a short period of time. Then, days later they see the store did not close permanently. And they see the same sign that claims the store is going out of business. Some business owners really do not end the business. They just want to earn more money.
People also hold their own sales. They hold garage sales and yard sales outside their home. They sell things they no longer want. Groups such as religious centers or schools hold bake sales. They sell cakes, cookies and other baked goods to raise money.
In America, you can always find a good sale, no matter the day or time of year. There is the Independence Day sale, Veteran's Day sale, clearance sale, sidewalk sale, red tag sale, white sale, blue light special, liquidation sale, half-off sale, warehouse sale, tent sale ...",high7059.txt
