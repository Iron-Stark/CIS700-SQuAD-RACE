2,B,"['to understand life.', 'to enjoy poetry.', 'to become teachers.', 'to become poets']","According to the writer, one of the purposes of teaching English is to get students  _  .","No poem should ever be discussed or ""analyzed"", until it has been read aloud by someone, teacher or student. Better still, perhaps, is the practice of reading it twice, once at the beginning of the discussion and once at the end, so the sound of the poem is the last thing one hears of it.
All discussions of poetry are, in fact, preparations for reading it aloud, and the reading of the poem is, finally, the most telling ""interpretation"" of it, suggesting tone, rhythm, and meaning all at once. Hearing a poet read the work in his or her own voice, on records or on film, is obviously a special reward. But even those aids to teaching can not replace the student and teacher reading it or, best of all, reciting it.
I have come to think, in fact, that time spent reading a poem aloud is much more important than ""analyzing"" it, if there isn't time for both. I think one of our goals as teachers of English is to have students love poetry. Poetry is "" a criticism of life"", and "" a heightening  of life"". It is ""an approach to the truth of feeling"", and it ""can save your life"". It also deserves a place in the teaching of language and literature more central than it presently occupies.
I am not saying that every English teacher must teach poetry. Those who don't like it should not be forced to put that dislike on anyone else. But those who do teach poetry must keep in mind a few things about its essential nature, about its sound as well as its sense, and they must make room in the classroom for hearing poetry as well as thinking about it.",high7343.txt
