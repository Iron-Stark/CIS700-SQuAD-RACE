1,C,"['The two languages will become separate languages.', 'American English will be used more and more.', 'The two languages will be closer and closer.', 'British English will be used more and more.']",Which of the following is TRUE?,"American and British people use different greetings. In the USA the commonest greeting is ""Hi"". In Britain it is ""Hello!"" or ""How are you?"" ""Hi!"" is creeping into British, too. When they are introduced to someone, the Americans say, ""Glad to know you. "" The British say, ""How do you do?"" or ""Pleased to meet you. "" When Americans say ""Good-bye"", they nearly always add, ""Have a good day. "" or ""Have a good trip. "" etc. to friends and strangers alike. Britons are already beginning to use ""Have a good day. ""
The British usually use ""got"" in the sense of ""have"". The Americans hardly ever do. AmE: Do you have a car, room, etc. ? Yes, I do. BrE: Have you got a car, room, etc. ? Yes, I have.
There are a number of differences between American and British English in the spelling of words, e. g. check(US)/cheque(UK). Many American words ending in ""or"", e. g. honor, labor are spelt in British English with an ""our,"" e. g. honour, labour. Many verbs in American English with ""ize"" or ""izing"" forms, e. g. organize, realizing are spelt in BrE with ""ise"" or ""ising"", e. g. organise, realising. In American English, ""practice"" is used both for the verb and noun. In BrE, the verb is spelt ""practise"", and the noun ""practice. "" In AmE, one writes ""traveler,"" while in BrE, one writes ""traveller"".
It was once _ that British and American English would become separate  languages finally. But the opposite has happened. The links between the two countries are so strong that linguistically ,and probably culturally too, they are closer together than ever before.
