It was a French restaurant. The  waiter was from France, but he didn't speak to them in French.  ""Would you like to see menu?"" , he asked in a kind way. ""Yes, please,""  Mr. Jackson said.
The  waiter gave them a menu each. They studied them. "" You can spend only twenty-five dollars,"" Mr. Jackson told his son. The  waiter  asked  Paul,"" What would you like, young man?""
""How much is the tomato soup?"" Paul asked.
"" Six dollars,"" the waiter said."" It's very good.""
""How much is  the duck with orange?"" Paul asked next.
""Fifteen dollars,"" the waiter said.
""How much is the chocolate ice cream?""
""Six dollars,"" the waiter said.
Paul added it up quickly. Six plus fifteen plus six is twenty-seven. He thought  he could have the duck and the soup, or the duck and ice cream."" I'll have the duck and the chocolate ice cream, please,"" he said to the waiter.
Paul said to his father, ""My meal will cost only twenty-one dollars. Can I keep the other four dollars? His father laughed.""No, Paul,"" he  said ,""leave it for the waiter.""",middle78.txt
