4,B,"['the new type of mobile phones is already on the market', 'the new type of mobile phones will sell very well', 'recycling mobile phones is not useful to the environment', 'other flowers may be used in the new type of mobile phones']",We can guess from the story   _  .,"A sunflower is a sunflower. A mobile phone is a mobile phone. But can you combine the two to do something for your local environment? As early as next year it may well be possible. When you have finished with your mobile phone you will be able to bury   it in the garden and wait for it to flower . A biodegradable   mobile phone was, this month, introduced by scientists. It is hoped that the new type of phone will encourage users to recycle. Scientists have come up with a new material over the last five years. It looks like any other plastic and can be hard or soft, and able to change shape. Overtime it can also break down into the soil without giving out any poisonous chemicals. British researchers used the new material to develop a phone cover that includes a sunflower seed .When this new type of cover turns into waste, it forms nitrates  . These feed the seed and help the flower grow. Engineers have designed a small transparent   window to hold the seed. They have made sure it only grows when the phone is thrown away. ""We've only put sunflower seeds into the cover so far. But we are working with scientists to find out which flowers would perform best. Maybe we could put roses in next time."" said one scientist.
As phone technology is developing so quickly, people are constantly throwing their mobiles away. This means producers are under pressure to find ways of recycling them. Some 650 million mobile phones have been sold this year. Most of them will be thrown away within two years, adding plastic, heavy metal and chemical waste to the environment. A biodegradable cover can change this, according to the scientists.
