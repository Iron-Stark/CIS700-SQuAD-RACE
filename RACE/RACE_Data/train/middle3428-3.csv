3,A,"['How to keep passengers safe?', 'How long do pilots actually spend flying a plane?', 'How to deal with jet lag?', 'How to take breaks during flying.']",What question doesn't the reporter ask in the interview?,"Here's an interview to a pilot about his life.
(R=""Reporter;"" P= Pilot)
R: How much time do pilots actually spend flying a plane?
P: It varies (WES'J) from about 20 minutes on some domestic   flights to as much as 18 hours on international flights. It all depends on if the flight is a short- or long-haul flight.
R: Do pilots take breaks during flights or do they fly the whole time?
P: Yes, we take breaks during long-haul flights. Airlines assign   three or four pilots to long flights. We take turns flying the plane.
R: If pilots are traveling all the time, how do they deal with jet lag  ?
P: Jet lag is annoying for almost all pilots. I try to go to sleep as I would at home.
R: How important is it to know the weight and size of the plane you are flying?
P: It is very important. We weigh almost everything put into the airplane and make estimates   according to the number of people on each flight.
R: Do pilots eat the airplane food?
P: Yes, we eat business class food! Airplane food changes every season and is very delicious if you don't hate eating lobster   every day! The pilots on the same plane are supposed to make different meal choices so that if one of the dishes causes food _ , only one of them will be sick. That way, at least one pilot will always be well enough to fly the plane!",middle3428.txt
