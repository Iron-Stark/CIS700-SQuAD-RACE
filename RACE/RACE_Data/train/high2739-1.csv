1,A,"['By finding his lost arm', 'By shooting the fish', 'By flying him to hospital', 'By offering his blood']",In which way did the boy's uncle help with the operation?,"Eight-year-old Jesse Abrogate was playing in the sea late one evening in July 2001 when a 7-foot bull shark attacked him and tore off his arm. Jesse's uncle jumped into the sea and dragged the boy to the store. The boy was not breathing. His aunt gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation while his uncle rang the emergency services. Pretty soon, a helicopter arrived and flew the boy to hospital. It was a much quicker journey than the journey by road.
Jesse's uncle, Vance Folsenzier, ran back into the sea and found the shark that had attacked his nephew. He picked the shark up and threw it onto the beach. A coastguard shot the fish four times and although this didn't kill it, the shark's jaws relaxed so that they could open them, and reach down onto its stomach, and pull out the boy's arm.
At the Baptist hospital in Pensacola, Dr Lan Rogers spent eleven hours reattaching Jesse's arm. ""It was a complicated operation,"" he said, ""but we were lucky. If the arm hadn't been recovered in time, we wouldn't have been able to do the operation at all. What I means is that if they hadn't found the shark, well then we wouldn't have had a chance.""
According to local park ranger   Jack Tomosvic, shark attacks are not that common. ""Jesse was just unlucky"" he says, ""Evening is the shark's feeding time. And Jesse was in the area without lifeguards. This would never have happened if he had been in the area where swimming is allowed."" When reporters asked Jesse's uncle how he had had the courage to fight a shark , he replied, ""I was mad and you do some strange things when you're mad.""",high2739.txt
