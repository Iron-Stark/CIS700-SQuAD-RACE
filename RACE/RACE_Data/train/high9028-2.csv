2,A,"['The character Max is brave enough in the story.', 'Max was sent to the forest as punishment.', 'People of all ages are in favor of the book.', 'The movie based on the book proves to be a great success.']",Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?,"Maurice Sendak's children's book, Where the Wild Things Are, published in 1963, has become very successful throughout the years and was made into a movie earlier this year.
The book's main character is a boy named Max who gets into trouble with his mother and is sent to bed without any supper.  Before long, Max's room magically becomes a forest, and he sails away to a land where monsters(,) live.  Max isn't scared, though, and becomes king of the wild things, but after a while, he begins feeling homesick.  Max sails back home and his supper is still hot when he arrives in his bedroom.
Many teachers and professors like this story and use it to help children develop creativity and imagination.  Melina Davis, an education professor, said she likes how the book contains a couple of pages that have only pictures on them.  ""This allows children to shape the story themselves,"" she said.
The book contains a few of larger words that some parents worry may confuse children, but experts say those words help improve children's reading skills and challenge them.
Davis said the book is well written which helps kids get involved in the story.  ""The book talks about what all children go through, like 'I was naughty but my mommy still loves me',"" Davis said.
The book also encourages children to face their fears.  ""I think it's really good to show that Max makes friends with the monsters,"" Davis said.  ""Kids can find out monsters aren't always the thing under the bed that's going to scare them.  I think this is good because it shows that the children can go to scary places but still have a positive experience.""
Since the book has been successful throughout the years, a movie was recently made and many people are excited to see it.  Davis said she thinks the movie will be wonderful but it might be a little scary for younger children.  ""You don't want bad dreams over a book that's extremely wonderful,"" Davis said.",high9028.txt
