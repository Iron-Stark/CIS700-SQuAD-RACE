0,A,"['less serious', 'less relaxed', 'more stressed', 'more nervous']",Lu Dongping thinks students are  _  on micro blogs.,"Micro blogs like Weibo are nothing new for the young Chinese. A newspaper in Chengdu did a survey last month. It found that 90 percent of junior high school students use micro blogs.
They give students an outlet   for emotion. ""I use micro blogs to record my life. I let everyone 'see' my feelings and complaints  ,"" said Liu Fangyue, 14, from Xiamen No. 1 Middle School. They have fun with classmates even after school. ""I would send a message to praise someone who came first in the exam,"" said Liu.
Teachers also join in the fun. ""When I sit down to talk to my students, they may not tell me their real thoughts,"" said Lu Dongping at Nanning No. 2 Middle School. ""But on micro blogs, they are more relaxed. They even make fun of me.""
You would be wrong if you think micro blogs are all about fun. Zhong Yun from Xiamen Haicang Experimental School sees it as a tool   to learn English. The 13-year-old girl follows foreign stars such as Avril Lavigne and Justin Bieber.
""In order to understand their English posts, I have to check the dictionary and learn many new words,"" said Zhong.
""Micro blogs widen students' perspectives  , but there are rules to follow,"" said Shi Zhongying, a professor from Beijing Normal University. He shares some of them with micro bloggers.
""Manage your time, and don't let micro-blogging affect your studies and health,"" said Shi. ""Don't give out your name, family address or phone number on micro blogs. You should also respect   truth and other people's privacy  .""",middle4954.txt
