0,C,"['to speak', 'to watch others', 'a sign language', 'a spoken language']","In the 1700s, the deaf were taught   _  .","For many years, no one could communicate with people who had been born without hearing. These deaf people were not able to use a spoken language.
But, beginning in the 1700s, the deaf were taught a special language. Using the language, they could share thoughts and ideas with others. The language they used was a language without sound. It was a sign language.
How did this sign language work? The deaf were taught to make certain movements using their hands, faces, and bodies. These movements stood for things and ideas. People might move their forefingers across their lips. This meant, ""You are not telling the truth."" They might tap their chins with three fingers. This meant, ""my uncle"".
The deaf were also taught to use a finger alphabet . They used their fingers to make the letters of the alphabet. In this way, they spelled out words. Some deaf people could spell out words at a speed of 130 words per minute.
Sign language and finger spelling are not used as much as they once were. Today the deaf are taught to understand others by watching their lips. They are taught how to speak.",middle1783.txt
