3,D,"['Running.', 'Swimming.', 'Flying.', 'Digging.']",What activity curriculums were not offered in this training school?,"Once upon a time,the animals decided that they must do something heroic to meet the problems of"" a new world"".So they organized a training school.

The duck was excellent in swimming,in fact,better than his instructor,but he made only passing grades in flying and was very poor in running.Since he was slow in running,he had to stay after school and also drop swimming in order to practice running.This was kept up until his webbed  feet were badly worn and he was only average in swimming.But average was acceptable in school,so nobody worried about that except the duck.
The rabbit started at the top of the class in running,but had a nervous breakdown because of so much make-up work in swimming.
The squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustration in the flying class where his teacher made him start from the ground up instead of from the treetop down.He also developed a ""Charlie horse"" and then got a C in climbing and a D in running.
The eagle was a problem child and was disciplined severely.In the climbing class he beat all the others to the top of the tree,but insisted on using his own way to get there.
At the end of the year,an abnormal eel that could swim very well,and also run,climb and fly a little,had the highest average and was the one who gave a good-bye speech.
The prairie dogs stayed out of the school because the administration would not add digging to the curriculum.",high6657.txt
