0,A,"['a mother dog', ""the little boy's name"", ""the farmer's son"", 'one of the puppies']","It can be inferred that ""Dolly"" in the passage was   _  .","A little boy went to a farmer who had some puppies  to sell and said, ""I want to buy one of your puppies."" Then reaching deep into his pocket, he pulled out a handful of change and held it up to the farmer. ""I've got thirty-nine cents. Is that enough to take a look.""
""Sure,"" said the farmer. Then he called his dog, ""Here, Dolly!""
Out from the doghouse and down the ramp  ran Dolly followed by four little balls of fur. The little boy pressed his face against the chain link fence. His eyes danced with delight.
As the dogs made their way to the fence, the little boy noticed something else moving inside the doghouse. Slowly, another little ball appeared. This one was much smaller than the others. Down the ramp it slid . Then in a somewhat awkward manner the little pup began hobbling  toward the others, doing its best to catch up...
""I want that one,"" the little boy said, pointing to the slow dog.
The farmer knelt down at the boy's side and said, ""Son, you don't want that puppy. He will never be able to run and play with you like these other dogs will.""
With that the little boy stepped back from the fence, reached down, and began rolling up one leg of trousers. There was a steel brace  running down both sides of his leg. It was joined to a specially made shoe. Looking back up at the farmer, he said, ""You see, sir, I don't run very well myself, and he will need someone who understands.""
The world is full of people who need someone who understands.",high4825.txt
