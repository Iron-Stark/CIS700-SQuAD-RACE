  Kimberly says that the College Soul book has been an amazing journey. In getting close to and heating from so many teenagers she kept hearing about this very emotionally packed time that begins with application to college and extends through the four-year experience. It became clear to her that this was a time of life that was filled with many challenges and that college students could really benefit from a book like this. For her, it was simply a continuation of a commitment   that she has made to teenagers to do what she can to inspire and motivate them while letting them know there are people who believe in them.
