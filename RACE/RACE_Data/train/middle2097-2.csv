One year, however, Mr.  Harris made a lot of money in his factory, so they decided to go to a foreign country and stay at a really good hotel.
They flew to Paris, and arrived at a 5-star hotel late in the evening. They thought they would have to go to bed hungry, because in that small hotel where they used to stay in the past, no meals were served after seven in the evening. They were surprised to be told that the hotel served dinner until ten.
