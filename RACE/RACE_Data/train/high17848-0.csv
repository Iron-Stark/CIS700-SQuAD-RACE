0,A,"[""The author's daughter"", 'The author', ""The author's husband"", 'The man in rags']",Who paid for the trip?,"My husband and I recently had the chance to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary in Morocco, Our daughter had very kindly given us the trip as a gift a few weeks ago.
One day, we were walking around in the lively and crowded streets, having a good time. I was looking at all the amazing places and architectures, and all the beautiful faces of the people around us. While I was excited about all the beautiful things around me, my husband walked into a shop. 
I was left standing alone in the street. The women in this country are never alone.
After fifteen minutes, I started feeling a little uneasy. A street man dressed in torn, ragged clothes was coming towards me. To tell the truth, I thought the worst at that moment. I thought he was a beggar who was coming to ask for money.
As he was passing, he stopped and touched my shoulder. He looked directly at me and the enormous love shining through his eyes made me relaxed. He then asked, ""D' accord? D' accord?"" I nodded yes.
And with his smile, calmness and those incredible peaceful loving eyes, I was moved for days, and my mind was filled with the memory of such a kind person.
For me, it was a reminder that we can all talk a good talk , but it is the action that matters. Usually, I tell others that we should be loving towards everyone. That day, I felt sorry as I did not walk my talk . But this stranger in rags gave me the most special reminder.
He showed me the beauty that anyone can receive care and concern, at any moment, from the most unlikely sources.",high17848.txt
