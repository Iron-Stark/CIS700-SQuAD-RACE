Then the old man goes up to him and says in his ears, ""Don't say anything about the horse before I sell it, then I will give you some meat.""
""All right,"" says the young man. After the old man sells the horse, he gives the young man some meat and says, ""Now, can you tell me how you see the bad ears of the horse?""
