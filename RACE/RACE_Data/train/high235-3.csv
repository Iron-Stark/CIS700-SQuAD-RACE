3,D,"['The adventure of a cat', 'An impressive vet', 'An unforgettable night', 'Love in relays']",Which of the following would be the best title for the text?,"Driving home from work one evening in the heavy rain, I found a very wet, injured cat on the side of the road. He looked up at me, meowing pitifully. A car must have hit it so it wasn't able to move. I stopped my car and carried the cat in and went on driving.
At the nearest vet clinic, the vet gently examined it. ""He's about eight months old and has two broken legs, but I would need X-rays to know how serious the damage is,"" he told me. ""As he's not your cat, I don't know if you want to go ahead with this. It could be rather expensive.""
I knew it would cost me hundreds of dollars, but I agreed with his advice. The following morning the vet rang to say the X-rays confirmed two bad breaks in his legs. ""I'll operate on his legs and put metal pins in them to keep them fixed."" he told me.
That afternoon I went to pick up my little friend. There I could hardly recognize him. His previously dirty fur was now a beautiful silver grey. His front legs were in two casts and he lay there looking at me, purring  happily.
I thanked the doctor and went out to pay the bill. ""I think you've given me the wrong account,"" I said to the clerk. ""This is only $85. He's had X-rays and an operation on his legs."" ""No, that's right,"" she replied. ""The vet has only charged you for the medication. There's a message on the bottom.""
Written under the total were the words ""SPECIAL RATE FOR ADOPTIONS."" I was speechless at his kind and generous gesture. I paid the account and under his message I wrote ""WITH GRATEFUL THANKS, CAT AND MUM.""",high235.txt
