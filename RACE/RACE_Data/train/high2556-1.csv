1,B,"['She was a little too light.', 'She was a little too heavy.', 'She disliked spaghetti.', ""She couldn't speak Italian.""]",What did the machine say to the Italian woman?,"A well-known manufacturer of weighing machines produced a new model.
The machine had a computer inside it, and this computer could do wonderful things: it could weigh people very accurately; it could tell them their weight in their own language; and it could tell them what they should eat to reduce their weight.
The manufacturer decided to try out his machine before he sold it to the shops.
He looked around for a good place to put it and finally decided on an airport. There were always people at an airport from many different countries.
The first person to use the machine was an Italian woman. She stood on the machine, put a coin in and waited to hear her weight.
The machine took only a second or two to weigh her, decide on her nationality and the language she spoke, and figure out what kind of food she should eat.
""Good morning, madam,"" it said in perfect Italian. ""Your weight is 72 kilos, three more than it should be for a woman of your height, age and nationality. This is because you have been eating too much spaghetti. I suggest you eat more fruit and vegetables. Please have a nice day"".
The second person to use the machine was a Chinese girl. She stood on the machine, put a coin in and waited to hear her weight.
""Good morning, Miss,"" the machine said in perfect Chinese. ""Your weight is 38 kilos, exactly the correct weight for your height, age and nationality. Continue to eat what you are eating. Please have a nice day.""
The third person to use the machine was a huge Australian woman. She walked up to the machine and looked at it for a long time. At last she found the courage to stand on the machine and put a coin in. The machine spoke immediately.  ""Good morning. Will one of you ladies please get off?""",high2556.txt
