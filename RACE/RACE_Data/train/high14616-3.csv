3,A,"['There will be swelling and redness.', 'The site will be dry.', 'Nothing will happen at all.', 'The pain will remain for a week.']",What will happen to the site on the body after the operation?,"A small group of people around the world have started implanting  microchips to link the body and the computer.
Mr. Donelson and three friends, who had driven 100 miles from their homes in Loockport, New York, to have the implants put in by Dr. Jesse Villemaire, whom they had persuaded to do the work, are part of a small group, about 30 people around the world, who have independently put in microchips into their bodies, according to Web-based reports.
At a shop William Donelson was having a four-millimeter-wide needle put into his left hand. ""I'm set,""he said with a deep breath. He watched as the needle pierced  the fleshy webbing between his thumb and a microchip was set under his skin. At last he would be able to do what he had long imagined: strengthen his body's powers through technology.
By putting the chip inside--a radio frequency identification device (RFID)--Mr. Donelson would have at his fingertips the same magic that makes safety gates open with a knock of a card, and bridge and tunnel traffic flow smoothly with an E-Zpass. With a wave of his hand he plans to connect with his computer, open doors and unlock his car.
Implanting the chip was relatively simple task but very meaningful to Mr. Doneselson, a 21-year-old computer networking student so interested in the link between technology and the body that he has data-input jacks  inside his body. _ might lead to an imagined future when people can be connected directly into computers. His new chip is enclosed in a glass container no bigger than a piece of rice and has a small memory where he has stored the words ""Technology"".
Some doctors have done the piercing in people's homes, and others have implanted chips in their offices after patients signed forms showing the fact that long-term studies have not been done on their safety. Piercers treat the implants much like any other medical operation steps, instructing people to keep the site dry, and advising them that swelling and redness should last a week.",high14616.txt
