I am interested in your advertisement in the ""Arkadia Morning Mail"" for hostesses to be in charge of the welfare ,entertainment and guiding of British guests in your holiday centre in Ruusulinna.
I am now a third-year student of English and History in the University of Gardenia but I am free from early June till late September.I have spent one year in London working in an English family and attending courses in English so I can speak this language fluently .
My father has been a guide and I have often followed him and also myself acted as a guide to English-speaking groups.My studies and experience have made me familiar with many interesting places in my country.I am sociable,really interested in people and,at the same time,I am the one with common sense on whom people can depend.
I put the address of the Manager of the local Tourist Information Office with the letter inside,who is ready to supply further information about me.
If you are interested in my application ,I should be pleased with further information about these jobs,including the salary and general condition of employment.
Yours faithfully,
