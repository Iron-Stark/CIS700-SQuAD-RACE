I would be the first to say that I am not materialistic. My friends regard me as a goody-goody  . My parents say I am conservative   and modest when it comes to clothes. I don't wear bikinis, and none of my skirts or shorts end above my knees. That is my choice.
So why, why did I decide to buy that skirt? My family and I were in Target, and there it was, waiting - a skirt specifically designed not to cover anything. It was light brown and looked like something one of those anime   schoolgirls would wear.
I checked my purse. The skirt cost $10. I had the money. I could buy it. I imagined walking into school and my pals' jaws   dropping. Guys would ask me out, and I would be happy. I could buy it - no, I should buy it.
I showed my mother. She was surprised but said it was my decision. My sister looked on jealously.
I went into the dressing room to try it on. I was so sure that this skirt would change me, somehow make me not what I am but what I wished to be. I slid my jeans off and put it on.
Now for the decisive moment. I looked in the mirror. There I was - a girl in a Superman T-shirt and sneakers who didn't know how to make friends with others.
Of course, the skirt had not changed me. It fit me well; that wasn't the problem. It might make me look good in the eyes of today's world.
But it simply was not me. I am not a girl who wears cool clothes to fit in. My glasses fogged up as I started to cry.
I took the thing off and went back into the comfort and safety of modesty.
My mom knocked on the door. ""Emily, are you okay?""
I wiped away my tears. ""I'm fine."" I looked in the mirror again and saw a blond skinny girl with thick glasses and a ponytail  . I saw myself.",high22443.txt
