1,D,"['Three', 'Five', 'Six', 'Four']","From the passage, how many things should we pay attention to when we take a good look at the person talking?","We can make mistakes at any age. Some mistakes we make are about money. But most mistakes are about people.
Why do we go wrong about our friends? Sometimes people hide their real meanings when they say something. And if we don't really listen, we miss the feeling behind the words. Suppose someone tells you, ""You're a lucky dog."" That's being friendly. But ""lucky dog""? There's a bit of envy  in those words. Maybe he doesn't see
himself. But ""lucky dog"" puts you down a little. He may mean you don't deserve your luck.
How can you tell the real meaning behind someone's words? One way is to take a good look at the person talking. Do his words fit the way he looks? Do his words agree with the tone  of voice? His posture ? The look in his eyes? Stop and think. If you spend the minute thinking about the real meaning behind one's words, it may save another mistake.",middle8226.txt
