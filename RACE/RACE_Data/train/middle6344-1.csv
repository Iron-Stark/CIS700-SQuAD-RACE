1,A,"['enjoys the rain', 'fears thunder', 'hates the storm', 'cares little about the weather']",From the passage we can learn that the writer   _  .,"Answers to life can be found in everyday events. Watching nature, watching people and watching animals communicate with each other provide some of the simplest ways to life's biggest problems.
This became clearer to me yesterday. It caused me to ask myself, ""How do I respond   to the storms in life?""
People usually run when it starts to rain. I love to walk in it, stand on my front door and feel it. I grew up doing it and have never really felt the fear many people do.
The animal world senses changes in the weather far earlier than humans. My dog, Ricky, begins to shake long before the storm is close enough to be noticed. I was about to feed my three dogs yesterday and as usual, I let them out in the yard first. They didn't move when thunder came across the skies. So I placed their food in their bowls and called Ricky into the kitchen.
Ricky was just standing there in place next to his bowl. The thunder became louder, which forced him to stop eating his meal. Then I watched Phil. He made his way across the kitchen floor and stood over Ricky's bowl. He ate all the remaining food. Generally, if Ricky was standing there, he wouldn't dare   come close. But today, he took advantage   of the storm and got what he wanted. His hope for the prize outweighed   his fear of the storm.
That's when it hit me. As men, we face all kinds of storms. They come in unannounced. Sometimes we stay in a corner or under the blankets, hoping it will all pass. However, if you dare put your head out, you'll discover there're people doing what they must to get what they must have out of life. Isn't it time you decided to take advantage of the storm?",middle6344.txt
