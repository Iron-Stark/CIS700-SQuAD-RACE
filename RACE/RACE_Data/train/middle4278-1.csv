1,D,"['Study pressure', 'Missing old friends', 'The sense of distance from parents', 'Getting good grades']",_  may not make some teens be in bad moods.,"Do you ever find yourself getting really unhappy for almost no reason? Or suddenly feeling down without knowing why? But why is the feeling so common among teens?
Maybe you're starting a new school and not able to see old friends. Getting good grades or wanting to be better in sports or other activities can be a concern  for many teens.
Being accepted by friends is important. Teens also may notice, for the first time, a sense of distance from parents and family. You may feel you want to be on your own and make your own decisions, but it can also seem a bit lonely at times.
Another important cause for mood changes is biology. When puberty   begins, the body starts producing hormones   . These hormones cause physical changes in the body. But at the same time, they also seem to cause mood changes.
Here are some things you can do that might make those bad moods a bit easier to deal with.
*  Remember you're not alone. Although not every teen experiences mood changes to the
same degree, they are common.
*  Talk to people you trust, Friends can help each other by realizing that they're not alone
in their feelings. Talking to parents is important, too. Parents can share their own
experiences dealing with bad moods. Teachers are often good resources and a doctor can
help to answer questions about development.
*  Get enough sleep, Though it can be hard to find enough time, getting enough rest is very
important. Being tired can lead to more sadness.
*  Create. Taking part in some kinds of activities, like building something out of wood, or
starting an art or music piece.",middle4278.txt
