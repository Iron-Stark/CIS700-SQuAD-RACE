The average French person sleeps almost nine hours every night,more than an hour longer than Japanese and Korean,who sleep the least in a survey of 18 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).Despite their siesta habit,Spaniards rank only third in the poll after Americans,who sleep more than 8.5 hours.
And while more and more French people grab a bite at fast-food chains these days or,wolf down a sandwich at their desk,they still spend more than two hour's a day eating.
That means their meals are twice as long as those of the average Mexican,who dedicates just over an hour a day to food,the OECD's ""Society at a Glance"" report on work,health and leisure in Asia,Europe and North and South America found.The Japanese,scrimping   on sleep and burdened with long working hours,still manage to spend close to two hours a day eating and drinking,placing them third behind New Zealanders.   
Despite the limited amount of time Americans spend eating each day---about an hour and a quarter--U.S.obesity) rates are the highest in the 30 members of OECD. 
The Japanese like to spend what remains of their rare free time watching television or listening to the radio.This takes up 47 percent of leisure time in Japan.Norwegians spend the most time at leisure,just over a quarter of their day,while at the low end,Mexicans spend just 16 percent of their time having fun.  
The OECD has 30 members.The survey covers only the countries for which appropriate figures were available.",high20886.txt
