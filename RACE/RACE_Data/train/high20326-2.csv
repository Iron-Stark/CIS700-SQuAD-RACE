Associated Press-----The number of visitors to New York City fell last year for the first time since 2001, but falls in tourism elsewhere across the United States made it the most popular destination in the country for the first time in almost two decades, tourism officials said on Monday.
Mayor Michael R. Bloombergpainted the 3.9 percent drop -- an estimated   45.3 million visitors -- as a victory, saying that during the recession the city had expected losing as much as 10 percent of its tourists. The city expects to recover most of the loss this year and remains on track to hit its long-standing goal of 50 million yearly visitors by 2012, the mayor said. 
""We have made our city cleaner, safer and more exciting than ever,"" Bloomberg said at a news conference at a Brooklyn restaurant. ""I do think we'll continue to see even more tourists on our streets as the economy improves, and I think that we'll continue to develop better than other cities."" 
Though many travelers stayed home simply because money was tight, the reducing number in international visitors could result from swine flu  fears and concerns over border security measures, Bloomberg said. 
Still, the Statue of Liberty, which reopened its crown to tourists, reported a jump in the number of visitors. So did other New York City attractions. And the city's entertainment and hotel industry -- which provides one-tenth of the city's private jobs -- actually grew in 2009. 
""The lodging industry  really is using discounting to motivate demand,"" he said, adding that the price drops have importantly _ ""the city's ability to keep the level of tourism that it's had.""",high20326.txt
