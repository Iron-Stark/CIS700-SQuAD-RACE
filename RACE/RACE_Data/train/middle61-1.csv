1,D,"['does morning exercises', 'does some reading', 'has classes', 'does the cleaning']","After Dick gets to school, he   _   first.","Dear Linda,
I'm glad to hear from you and I would like to be your pen friend. In your letter, you said you wanted to know something about my school life .
I walk to school at 7:30 every morning because the school is near our house. When I get to school at about 7:45, I often do the cleaning with my classmates. After that we do some reading for half an hour. We have four lessons in the morning. I often have my lunch at 12:00 at school. We usually have two lessons in the afternoon. The school is over at about 5:00 and then I go home.
My favorite subject is Chinese. I like all the teachers because they are friendly. I am keen on sports and I enjoy playing football best. I'm a member of our school football team. What about your school life?
Best wishes!
