1,C,"['Young people', 'First generation Americans', 'Old people', 'Less-educated people']","Who cares least for wealth, according to the passage?","Who says Americans worship the almighty   dollar? It's not true. Having enough free time is more important to most Americans than being rich, according to a new survey.
Only 13 percent of more than 2,400 people questioned in the telephone survey ranked being wealthy as most important to them, while 67 percent ranked free time as their top priority  , higher than having a successful career, getting married, and having children. ""Everyone wants free time to do the things they want to do, young, middle-aged or old,"" said Richard Morin, of the Pew Social ~ Demographic Trends Project, which conducted the survey. ""So our desire to play unites us.""
The survey also showed that people who were educated in university valued career success over wealth, so did middle-aged people. Not surprisingly, those who didn't have money, ranked wealth very highly. This included minorities, first generation Americans and less educated people. The survey also revealed that a disproportionate   number of people under the age of 30 and retired people in the group made $ 20,000 or less a year. But the emphasis on wealth lessens with age, with younger people putting value on it but hardly any seniors. ""It just diminishes   with time as the reality sets in that you would never be rich,"" Morin said. ""But also, as for old people the reality sets in that you don't have to be rich to lead a very comfortable and fulfilling life. ""
While wealth was not at the top of people's list of priorities, 43 percent still said it was somewhat important.",high15130.txt
