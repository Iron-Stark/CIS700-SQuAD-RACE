Keep a kitchen diary
All of us should keep a kitchen diary, and we can know that how much food we waste at home.The first thing for us to do is to stop throwing away food that we can still eat.We should eat everything we buy and if we cannot, we should buy less.
Buy only what we need
We should ask for smaller portions in stores.We should also check how much food we have before buying more.We shouldn't bring much food we don't need home even if large posters ask us to do so.
Develop the habit of packing food
Chinese consumers are generous and friendly.In restaurants, often too much food is ordered and served.So when ordering out, we are supposed to exclude the food in the order if we don't plan to eat it.And order smaller servings in   restaurants and take home what we cannot finish.
