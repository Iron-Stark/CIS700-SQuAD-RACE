2,D,"['Being self-confident works', 'Nothing can not be neglected', 'Everything is easy to do', 'Success is easy, but so is neglect']",What would be the best title for the passage?,"People often ask me how I became successful in that six-year period of time while many of the people I knew did not. The answer is simple: The things I found to be easy to do, they found to be easy not to do.
I found it easy to set the goals that could change my life. They found it easy not to. I found it easy to read the books that could affect my thinking. They found that easy not to. I found it easy to attend the classes. They said it probably really wouldn't matter. Six years later, I'm a millionaire and they are all still blaming the economy, the government and company policies. They neglected  to do the basic, easy things.
In fact, the primary reason most people are not doing can be summed up in a single word: neglect. It is not the lack of money - banks are full of money. It is not the lack of opportunity - the government continues to offer the most opportunities. It is not the lack of books - libraries are full of books - and they are free! It is not the schools - the classrooms are full of good teachers. We have plenty of good advisors. The major reason that so few take advantage of all that we have is neglect.
Don't do the things which cause us to feel guilty  and guilt _ our self-confidence. As our self-confidence reduces, so does the level of our activity. And as our activity goes down, so do our results. And as our results suffer, our attitude begins to weaken. And as our attitude begins changing from positive to negative, our self-confidence becomes even less ... and on and on it goes.
So my suggestion is that when giving choice of ""easy to"" and ""easy not to"", do not neglect to do the simple, basic, ""easy"" but potentially life-changing activities.",high11941.txt
