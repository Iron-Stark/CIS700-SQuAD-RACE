2,B,"['pay the barber for his work', 'process his hair into a wig', 'give the Little Princess Trust along with a wig', 'give a child who lost his hair through cancer treatment']",Elijah's parents try to raise money to   _  .,"By the age of almost four,  Elijah Edney has never had a haircut in his life.  But now he can ' t wait to visit the barber's  -  for two reasons: losing his two - foot - long golden hair will mean   that strangers stop mistaking him for a girl; the hair will be donated to charity to provide a wig     for a child with cancer.
Mrs.  Edney, who works in a restaurant, says, ""Elijah has always had beautiful hair, so I let him grow it as he w8nted.  It' s like silk.  But now it is at a stage where people mistake him for a  girl and he wants it cut into a boy's haircut. ""
Mrs.  Edney and her husband want to collect enough money-PS350-to process Elijah's hair  for a sick child.  She says,  ""I couldn't bear to see all Elijah's beautiful hair go to waste and my  mum mentioned charities that have human hair made into wigs. ""
Mrs. Edney says, ""If we can raise the amount we want, it will mean a family will not have   to pay for the wig and can receive it for free.  When you've got children yourself, you hope that if  they lost their hair someone would do the same for them by donating their hair. ""
The two-foot-long hair will be donated to the Little Princess Trust    to  make a wig for children suffering cancer. Elijah keeps telling people he is giving his hair to poor  princesses and he is so excited about it.
A spokesman for the Little Princess Trust says, ""We're very grateful to anyone who decides   to have their hair cut to donate it to the Little Princess Trust. As a result of hair donations like  this, the charity receives real-hair wigs for free to pass on to families whose children have sadly  lost their own hair through cancer treatment.
