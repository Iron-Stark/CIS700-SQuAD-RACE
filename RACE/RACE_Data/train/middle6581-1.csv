1,C,"['too many', 'cheap', 'too much', 'beautiful']",What does Mr. Hunt think of the dress?,"Mrs. Hunt comes back from work. She tells Mr. Hunt about a nice dress. ""I see it in the shop every day,"" she says ""and...""
""And you want to buy it?"" says Mr. Hunt. ""How much is it?""
""Two hundred and sixty dollars.""
""Wow, two hundred and sixty dollars for a dress? That's too much!""
But every evening when he comes back, Mrs. Hunt only speaks about the dress, so at last he says, ""Oh, buy the dress! Here is the money!"" She is very happy.
But the next evening, when Mr. Hunt wants to have a look at the nice dress, Mrs. Hunt says ""I don't want to buy it.""
""Why not?"" he asks.
""Well, it's still in the window of the shop after a week. So I think no one wants this dress. And I don't want it, either.""",middle6581.txt
