2,B,"['Humorous and patient.', 'Quiet but loving.', 'Generous and talkative.', 'Proud but strict.']",Which words best describe the author's father?,"The pickle jar , as I can remember, sat beside the dresser in my parents' bedroom. When ready for bed, Dad would toss any coins in his pockets into the jar. As they dropped, they landed with a merry jingle.
Whenever the jar was full, Dad would roll up the coins. Every time he slid the box of rolled coins across the counter at the bank toward the cashier, he would smile proudly and say,""All for my son's college.""
We would always celebrate each deposit by stopping for an ice cream cone. Dad would show me the coins in his change, saying ""When we get home, we'll start filling the jar again."" He always let me drop the first coins into the empty jar. ""You might have to get to college on loose change,"" he said. ""But you'll get there.""
As years passed, I went to college, got married and took a job.
Once, while visiting my parents, I noticed the jar was gone. It had served its purpose. My dad was a man of few words and never lectured me on the values of determination, perseverance or faith. The jar had taught me those far better than the most flowery of words could have done.
Soon, my daughter Jessica was born. We spent Christmas that year with my parents. After dinner, Mom and Dad sat next to each other, taking turns holding their first grandchild. When Jessica began crying, my wife Susan took her from Dad's arms to put her in my parents' room.
Susan came back, tears in her eyes and led me into the room. ""Look,"" she said softly. To my amazement, there, next to the dresser, stood the old pickle jar, as if never removed, the bottom already covered with coins. I walked over to it, dug down into my pocket, and pulled out several coins. Choked by emotion, I dropped them into the jar.
Dad had slipped quietly into the room when I looked up. Our eyes locked, but neither of us spoke, because we knew nothing had to be said.",high13493.txt
