0,B,"['The author was a newsboy when he was twelve years old.', ""The old lady didn't know who broke the window."", ""The author felt guilty of breaking the old lady's window."", 'The story happened twenty years ago.']",Which of the following sentences is NOT true according to the passage?,"Twenty years seems like a long time to remember the name of a mere acquaintance.I have forgotten the  name of an old lady,who was a customer on the paper route in my hometown when I was a twelve-year-old boy.Yet it exists in my memory that she taught me a lesson in forgiveness which I shall never forget.
    On a winter afternoon.a friend and I were throwing stones onto the roof of a house for fun.I was brave  enough to find a big rock and threw it out.Unfortunately,the rock was so heavy that it didn't fly onto the roof  but into the room through the window.At the sound of crashed glass,we knew we were in trouble and ran  away.
    I was so scared about being caught that I didn't go to deliver newspapers to the old lady for a few days.The next week,when I gave her the paper again,she still greeted me with a big smile as usual.I felt so guilty,however,so I made up my mind that I would save my paper delivery money to cover the cost of her window.I made it.Three weeks later,I saved seven dollars and put them in an envelope with a note explaining that 1 was sorry for breaking her window and that I hoped the money could repair it.I waited until it was dark,and put the envelope in her door secretly.
    The next day,I handed the old lady her paper and was able to return the warm smile that I was receiving  from her.She thanked me and gave me a bag of delicious cookies she had made herself.
    Reaching for the cookies,I felt an envelope and pulled it out of the bag.When I opened the envelope,I  was surprised.Inside were the seven dollars and a short note saying,""I am proud of you.""",high21253.txt
