     Yang Xin , is the founder of Green River, one of the country ' s biggest non-govemmental  organizationsto protect the  country's major rivers.
     The Yangtze River begins from glaciers in the Tanggula Mountains on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
     Garbage was rarely seen in the area about 20 years ago, Yang said, as local nomadic people ledtraditional self-sufficient lives, living in tents. Thanks to increasingly convenient transportation, they ' ve started to use modern products packed in plastics, which can ' t degrade naturally.
     ""They don' t have a waste management system and just throw rubbish away like before. So tons of garbage are left on the grasslands and river ways,"" said Yang.
     He founded a group with the purpose of dealing with garbage such as plastic bottles, batteries, lunch boxes and so on.
     In 1997, Yang and his group founded the Sonam Dhargye Nature Preservation Station in the Hoh Xil Nature Reserve, in memory of the anti-hunting hero who sacrificed his life to protect Tibetan antelopes.",high17430.txt
