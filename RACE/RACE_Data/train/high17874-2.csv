2,D,"['An Unexpected Gift', 'An Unforgettable Trip Abroad', 'A Pleasant Shopping Experience', 'A Chance Meeting with Angels']",Which of the following can be the best title for the text?,"I've ridden a lot of buses in my time. There was the one in India that was so crowded, I had to climb onto the top just to breathe. Neither will I forget the bus in South Africa that was almost taken up by monkeys. No matter how entertaining they were at the time, none can compare to my first ride on what I now call the Leisure Village Local.
When I first moved into Leisure Village, I didn't even know bus transportation was provided. Then I had an operation on my left foot and I couldn't drive. As I didn't want to keep making trouble for friends to shop for me, I decided to try out the Leisure Village Local. 
The next morning, undaunted, I stood with the support of my crutches  and waited. Suddenly, the bus arrived. As soon as I boarded the bus, I discovered I was all by myself. Then the bus approached another stop, and four women climbed aboard. They sat next to me and introduced themselves.
A few minutes later, we arrived at the Wal-Mart in Middle Island. As soon as we entered, one of my new friends showed me how to operate the motorized shopping cart . Another walked alongside the entire time, waiting to help if something was out of reach. One hour later, another insisted on carrying my bags onto the bus. And the fourth woman carried my bags to my front door when we got back. I thanked them all for their help, and told them I would see them soon.
The next day morning, I found a brown paper bag at the front door. Inside was a giant bowl of chicken soup, and a note.
""Get well soon."" It was signed, ""Your guardian angels.""
I rode the Leisure Village Local two more times later, but didn't see any of my guardian angels. Maybe they're helping someone else, I thought. Or, maybe they flew south for the winter.",high17874.txt
