2,D,"['give out your cards and brochures every now and then', 'talk about the quality of your product as much as possible', 'interrupt others when they make a mistake', 'let other people express themselves completely']","When talking with others, you should   _  .","If you're networking   and nothing is happening, you might need to evaluate how you're doing it. Maybe you show up at each event and still feel challenged by the process. You aggressively talk to people, give out your cards, call endlessly to schedule an appointment but have no real success from your efforts. To help you gain a different future, here are ten habits you should avoid.
Ineffective networkers:
1. Lack patience. They expect immediate results and want business now, not tomorrow.
2. Constantly ""selling"" something. They see dollar signs every time they shake hands with someone.
3. Too many choices. If they offer a variety of products, they might try too hard to tell about all of them. Offering too much information sends a confusing message making it difficult for people to send referral  . Opportunities are all around us but when you're networking, only focus on one.
4. Change positions too often. If they move from company to company or do something totally different, it might be difficult for people to keep up with them.
5. Lack manners and respect. They interrupt others, talk with food in their mouth, aren't very polite and appear unprofessional. They call people during dinner or on the weekends without thinking whether the occasion is suitable.
6. Distribute too many cards and sales literature. They come while loading with brochures, flyers  , catalogues and samples.
7. Focus on themselves. Too much self promotion can leave the other person to feel unappreciated. Every sentence begins with ""I"" and is all about their business.
8. ""Talking"" instead of ""giving"". They don't realize what other people sense when they are being very selfish. Others may think that they are being taken advantage of.
9. Lack authenticity   and personal values. They may create unrealistic expectations and not deliver on their promises. Sometimes doing things without integrity   possibly twists the truth.
10. Poor communication and interpersonal skills. They have trouble speaking effectively, building relationships and following up.
Networking is a process that is an investment of time and money. If you find you're doing any of these habits, consider learning how to improve on these and maximize your results while networking. You'll start to get better at connecting with people and obtain more referrals.",high4621.txt
