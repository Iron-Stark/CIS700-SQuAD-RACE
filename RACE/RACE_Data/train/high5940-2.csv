2,C,"['Wealthy people often wear expensive shoes.', 'Pleasant people like wearing uncomfortable shoes.', 'Aggressive people are likely to wear""ankle boots.', 'Fashion shoes are typically worn by outgoing people.']",Which of the results is beyond people's expectation?,"Reseachers at the University of Kansas say that people can accurately juage 90 percent of a stranger's personality simply by looking at the person's shoes.""Shoes convey useful information about their wearers,''the authors wrote in the new study published in the Journal of Research in Personality.
Lead researcher Omri Gillath said the judgments were based on the style,cost,color and condition of someone's shoes.In the study,63 University of Kansas researchers looked at pictures showing 208 different pairs of shoes worn by the study's participants.Volunteers in the study were photographed in their most commonly worn shoes,and then filled out a personality questionnaire.
Some of the results were expected:People with higher incomes most commonly wore expensive shoes,and flashier shoes were typically worn by outgoing people.However,some of the more specific results are strange enough.For example,""practical and functional'' shoes were generally worn by more ""pleasant"" people,while ankle boots were more linked with ''aggressive'' personalities.The strangest of all may be that those who wore' 'uncomfortable looking"" shoes tend to have ""calm"" personalities.And if you have several pairs of new shoes or take extreme care of them,you may suffer from ""attachment anxiety"",spending lots of time worrying about what other people think of your appearance.There was even a political calculation in the mix with more liberal types wearing ""shabbier and less expensive"" shoes.
The researchers noted that some people will choose shoe styles to mask their actual personalities,but researchers noted that volunteers were also likely to be unaware that their footwear choices were showing the deep side of their personalities.",high5940.txt
