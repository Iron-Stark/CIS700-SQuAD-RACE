0,D,"['Because he had no friends and relatives there.', ""Because he didn't know the school well."", 'Because he was not good at English.', 'Because he was shy.']",Why was the writer nervous when he was at Merchiston Castle School on the first day?,"Today is my first day at Merchiston Castle School,and I was really nervous about it, because I have never visited the school before and didn't take any summer course. Despite my anxiety,I soon relaxed once I arrived; the staff were so nice that I felt my spoken English was better than it actually was! As soon as I walked into the dayroom of my boarding house,I was absolutely  amazed by the friendly atmosphere; everyone was so friendly that a boy as shy as I had no difficulty in setting in,and I made many new friends on my very first day,although I was struggling to remember all the names.
Also I realized there were other international students in the house from all over the world,such as South Korea,Japan and Russia.Although their English was not so fluent,it didn't take long for us to understand each other at all.In some ways,it was even better to practice Enlgish by speaking to the international students,because we were both learning.
As a boarder,the quality of food is something I consider very important,and Merchiston has not let me down.The school kitchens are run by a professional catering company,and the quality of food is excellent,also they take the issue of a healthy diet really seriously.I remember once I was asked to take more salad for my meal by a member of the kitchen staff for I did not have enough vegetables.This brings to another point of being a boarder:you need to learn how to look after yourself and be responsible for yourself.One of the huge advantages of being a _ is that we can have breakfast in the school,which means we don't have to pull ourselves out of the bed as early as the daypupils!",high11293.txt
