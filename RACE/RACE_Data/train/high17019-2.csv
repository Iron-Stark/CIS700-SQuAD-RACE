2,C,"[""we shouldn't judge a person by his look"", 'we should allow people more freedom to dress differently', 'we should be more helpful and tolerant to strange dressing of the young.', ""we shouldn't be too particular about people in life""]",The author intends to tell us that_.,"My six--year-old granddaughter, Caitlynd.and I stopped at m Tim Horton's shop for a blueberry cake.As we were going out the door, a young teenage boy was coming in.
    This young man had no hair on the sides of his head and a set of blue spiked hair on top of it.One of his nostrils was pierced,and a ring ran through the hole and a chain went across his face and was attached to a ring he was wearing in his ear.He held a skateboard under one arm and a basketball under the other.
    Caitlynd,who was walking ahead of me,stopped at once when she saw the teenager.I thought he'd scared her and she'd frozen on the spot.
    I was wrong.
    My granddaughter backed up against the door and opened it as wide as it would go.Now I was face to face with the young man.I stepped aside and let him pass.His gracious response was a polite ""Thank you very much"".
    On our way to the car, I praised Caitlynd for her manners in holding open the door for the young man.She didn't seem to be troubled by his appearance but I wanted to make sure.If a grandmother talked about freedom of self expression and allowing people their differences was suitable,I wanted to be ready.
     _ .
    The only thing Caitlynd noticed about the teenager, was the fact that his arms were full.""He would have a hard time in opening the door.''
    I saw the partially shaved head,the set of spiked hair, the piercings and the chain.She saw a person carrying something under each arm and heading toward a door.
    In the future,I hope to get down on her level and raise my sights.",high17019.txt
