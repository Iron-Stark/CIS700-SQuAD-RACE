I have received your loving letter from school and I am glad to know that you are becoming responsible  enough to decide on your career .
You are now in the final year of high school and are going to start further education in college. You know that we belong to different times, and my social life is different from yours. However, all I can say as advice is that you must choose a career wisely. The first consideration is your interest. You can only succeed and feel happy when you do something you enjoy. You must get a job which not only provides you with something useful, but also you are pleased with. Then, you must read a lot in the field  you are aiming at. Also, you should get to know the men and women who work in that field, when mind and heart work together, success is _ .
No career is more or less important. I think your interest may be in the field of making TV programmes. Your good communication skills, your taking an active part in school plays and the prizes you have won in speech competitions all lead you to that direction. So a career in Mass Communication and TV film production will bring luck to you. If you succeed in that field, you will become famous and rich.
Think a thousand times before making any final decision about your career. After all, we want you to be a man of success.
We all know that you are old enough to think for yourself.
With all the best wishes !
Your loving father",middle5606.txt
