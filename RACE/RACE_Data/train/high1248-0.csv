0,B,"['Wilson had hit him before.', 'He had mistaken Wilson for a friend of his.', 'Wilson was a stranger there.', 'Wilson made a lot of noise when he was walking.']",Why did the young man hit Wilson from behind?,"One day, Wilson was walking quietly along the road when someone hit him hard on the back of his neck.He looked behind him, and saw a young man whom he had never seen before.
""How dare you hit me like that?"" shouted Wilson.
The young man said he had mistaken Wilson for a friend of his and that he thought Wilson was making a lot of noise about nothing.
This insult   made Wilson even angrier, of course, and he at once decided to bring the young man before a judge.
Now, the judge, who heard the case, was a friend of the young man's father's, and, although he pretended to be quite fair, he was thinking about what he could do to protect the young man from being punished while at the same time not to be appearing unfair.
Finally he said to Wilson, ""I understand your feelings in this matter very well.Would you be satisfied if I let you hit the young man as he hit you?""
Wilson said he would not be.The young man had insulted him and should be _ punished.
""Well, then,"" said the judge to the young man, ""I order you to pay ten coins to Wilson.""
Ten coins was very little for such a crime, but the young man did not have it with him, so the judge allowed him to go and get it.
Wilson waited for him to return with the money.He waited an hour, and then two hours, while the judge took care of other business.
When it was nearly time for the court to close, Wilson chose a moment when the judge was especially busy, came up quietly and hit him hard on the back of the neck.Then he said to him, ""I am sorry, but I can't wait any longer.When the young man comes back, tell him that I have passed my right to the ten coins on to you.""",high1248.txt
