1,D,"['Doctor Van.', 'The man', ""Doctor Van's son."", ""The man's son.""]",Who needed an operation at once?,"It was late on a snowing night. Doctor Van was driving fast to the hospital to do an operation   on a badly hurt   person. Minutes later he came to a red traffic light and had to stop to wait. A man suddenly opened the door of the car and got in.
""Drive on, "" shouted the man, ""Just do what I've told you to. "" The man was strong and tall while Doctor Van was not.
""But I'm a doctor, "" Van tried to tell him what he was going to do. ""I'm on my way to the hospital to save..."" ""Stop talking and drive faster, as fast as you can!"" the man stopped Van and Van had to do so.
Only a few minutes had passed when the man made Van stop his car again and drove him off, and he himself drove away very quickly.
Van stood in the snow for a moment and then walked around to look for a taxi.
Another half an hour had passed when Van got out of the taxi and ran into the hospital. But it was too late and nothing could be done.
The man who had taken Van's car was standing by the person all the time. He was so sad! Only then did Van know that the man was the father of that badly hurt person!",middle1385.txt
