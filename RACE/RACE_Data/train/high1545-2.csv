2,B,"[""came to Joubert's home when she was 5 months old"", ""loves eating in the Joubert's kitchen"", ""doesn't see herself as a human being"", 'has more than three boyfriends']",We can learn from the passage that Jessica   _,"What kind of pets do people have in your country? Dogs? Cats? How about a duck, hippo  or lion? Here are two cases of animal owners with unusual pets.
Barrie Hayman has a pet duck called Star. Barrie adopted  him after his brothers and sisters stayed away from him at birth. Barrie, a duck breeder, realized the little duck needed special attention. So he began taking Star with him everywhere he went. ""I would put him in my pocket while I did my shopping,"" said Barrie. Now, at five months, Star is too big for Barrie's pocket, but the two are still _ . They watch sports, together and even share a drink together. Barrie said, ""He is a fantastic duck. I've never known any like him."" Star even has his own Facebook page, with more than 2,000 Face book friends.
Then there is the case of Tonie and Shirley Joubert in South Africa. They live with their hippo, Jessica. Tonie saved Jessica from floodwaters when she was only a day old. Jessica lives outside their riverside house, but she knows how to open the kitchen door, and often goes there for a snack. Tonie recently said, ""I don't know whether Jessica sees me as a hippo or whether she sees herself as a human."" Shirley is more certain, ""Jessica sees herself as our child and I see Jessica as my daughter. I can't imagine my life without Jessica."" Jessica is free to leave, and often visits wild hippos that live nearby. But she always returns home at night. Jessica's website notes that she has three hippo boyfriends, but one in particular,Fred, is her favorite. They often go grazing  together and Fred has recently moved onto the Joubert's house as well.",high1545.txt
