""Rome has tried to protect fish more than anywhere else in the world. It stands out for recognizing that fish are interesting animals who deserve our respect and compassion every bit as much as dogs and eats and other animals,"" said Karin Robertson, a director of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
