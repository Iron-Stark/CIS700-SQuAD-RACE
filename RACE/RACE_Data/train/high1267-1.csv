When his friend Bob saw him, he laughed and said, ""What has happened to your hair, Jack?""
Jack said, ""I tried a new barber's shop today, because I wasn't quite satisfied with my old one, but this one seems even worse.""
Bob agreed . ""Yes, I think you're right, Jack. Now I'll tell you what to do when you go into a barber's shop next time: look at all the barber's hair, find out whose hair looks worst, and then go straight to him.""
""Why shall I go to him?"" Jack asked. ""But that would be foolish!""
""Oh, no, it wouldn't,"" answered Bob. ""Who cut that man's hair? Just think it. He couldn't cut it himself, could he? Another of the barbers cut it. So you know he can't be the worst barber.""",high1267.txt
