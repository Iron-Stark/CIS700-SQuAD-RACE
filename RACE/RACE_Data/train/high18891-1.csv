1,B,"['have timely and delicious food', 'get a warm and comfortable room with hot water', 'make many friends to sell machines to farmers', 'sell machines well and earn much money']","After he got to his destination , Mr. White most expected to   _  .","Mr. White sold kinds of machines to farmers, which he thought was not really a very exciting job, but he had always been interested in traveling on business.
He had a big car, and usually enjoyed driving it long distances, but he was also quite satisfied to go by train sometimes, especially when the weather was bad. He was a little frightened of driving in the rain or snow, and it was less tiring to sit comfortably in a train and look out of the windows without being worried about how to get to the next place.
One of Mr. White's problems was often where to stay when he reached some small places in the country. He did not expect timely and wonderful food, but he found it annoying   when he was given a cold room, and when there was no hot water after a long and tiring journey.
Later one winter evening, Mr. White arrived at a small railway station. The journey by train that day had not been at all interesting, and Mr. White was cold and tired and hungry. He was looking forward to a simple but satisfying meal by a brightly burning fire, and then a hot bath and a comfortable bed.

The local man answered,"" We have two.""
""And which of the two would you advise me to go to?"" Mr. White asked then.
The local man scratched  his head for a moment and then answered,""Well, it's like this, whichever one you go to, you'll be sorry you don't go to the other.""",high18891.txt
