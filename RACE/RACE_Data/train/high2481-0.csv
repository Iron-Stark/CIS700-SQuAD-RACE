Sometimes, you feel as if you're _ and all the questions on your maths test might seem easy. But occasionally you feel horrible, and you lose things and cannot focus on our schoolwork.
For more than 20 years, scientists have suggested that highself-esteem  is the key to success.Now, new research shows that focusing just on building self-esteem may not be helpful. In some cases, having high self-esteem can make people less likeable or more upset when they fail in something.
""Forget about self-esteem,"" says Jennifer Crocker, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, US. ""It's not the important thing.""

""The besttherapy  is to recognize your faults,"" Vohs says. ""It's OK to say, 'I' m not so good at that,' and then move on.""",high2481.txt
