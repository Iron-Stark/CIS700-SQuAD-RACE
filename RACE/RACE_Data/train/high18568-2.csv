2,C,"['had to borrow money to pay for the meal', 'was thrown into water by the waiter', 'learned that meals on the ship were free', 'said he would pay double after a time']","In the end,the English traveler  _  .","An English traveler spent a few weeks in Sweden. When he was about to return home,he found that he had only enough money left to get a ticket to England. Thinking the matter over, he decided that as it was only a two days' voyage he could get home without eating anything. So he bought a ticket with that little money he had and went on board the ship.
He closed his ears to the sound of the lunch bell,and when dinner came,he refused to go down to the place where people had their dinner, saying that he did not feel well.
The following day he did not get up until breakfast was over, pretending that he had overslept himself. At lunch time, too, he kept out of the way. By the time of dinner,however,he became so hungry that he could even eat paper.
""I can't stand this any longer, "" he said to himself.""I must have something to eat."" At the dinner table he ate everything put in front of him.When he was quite full, he felt stronger and at once went to see the waiter.
""Bring the bill, "" he said to the waiter.
""The bill?"" said the waiter in surprise.
""Yes, "" answered the traveler.
""There isn't any bill here,"" said the waiter,""On this ship meals are already included in the ticket.""",high18568.txt
