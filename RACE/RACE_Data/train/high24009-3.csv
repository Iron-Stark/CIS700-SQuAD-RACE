Still, something didn't feel quite right. She wanted more challenges and creativity.
In the 1980s, Jan answered a call to rewrite a year's children's church lesson. She quickly found That writing stories and activities for children offered all she desired. She dove in and has never looked back. Her work has appeared in Ladybug, Shining Star and many others. 
As Jan continued building credits in children's magazines, educational magazines, and parenting Magazines, she looked for opportunities to pass along what she had learned to other writers. Soon, teaching small community college classes wasn't enough---she wanted to help other writers to find success in creating material for children. 
In 2001, she discovered the Institute of Children's Literature and she's been happily instructing students here ever since. To best meet her students' needs, she's constantly searching out new information. As a web editor, Jan looks after the needs of all the visitors to this site.
