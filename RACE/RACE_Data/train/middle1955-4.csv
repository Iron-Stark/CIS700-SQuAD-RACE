4,B,"['Good readers must be good writers', 'Reading is a good hobby for different reasons.', 'You can read on computers', 'Reading is not out of date.']",What does the passage mainly tell us?,"Reading is a good hobby for all kinds of reasons.
First, reading is fun. You can always keep yourself happy if you like reading. You will never feel bored or tired.
Next, you can read a book anywhere-- in a car, on a plane, or even in the bathroom. All you need is a book!
Another good reason for reading is that it is useful. If you read as a hobby, you will get better and better at it. And you will read faster and find it easier to understand what you read. As you reading skills improve, you will probably find your schoolwork becomes much better.
Some people say that reading is out of date . This is not true. You can read on computers, and the better you read, the better your computer skills will be.
Good readers may become writers, too. They always have more things to write about.
Reading is a wonderful hobby. Why not start reading right now?",middle1955.txt
