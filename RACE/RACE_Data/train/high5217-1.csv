1,B,"[""Because she enjoyed the country's fresh air."", 'Because she was afraid to disturb the rest of the family.', 'Because she lived in a small house far away.', 'Because she was afraid to practise the high tones.']",Why did she go for long walks along the country roads?,"Mrs. Janes gave music lessons at a school.She had a good voice and enjoyed singing, except that some of her high tones sound like a gate that had forgotten to oil.Mrs. Janes knew her weakness well, and took every chance she could find to practise these high notes. As she lived in a small house, where she could not practise without disturbing the rest of the family, she usually went for long walks along the country roads whenever she had time and practised her high notes there.Whenever she heard a car or a person coming along the road, she stopped and waited until she could no longer be heard before she started practicing again, because she was a shy person.
One afternoon, a fast, opened car came up behind her so silently and so fast that she didn't hear it until it was only a few yards from her.She was singing some of her highest and most difficult tones at that time and as the car passed, she saw an anxious expression came over the driver's face.He stopped his car suddenly, jumped out and began to examine all his tyres carefully.
Mrs. Janes didn't dare to tell him what the noise he had heard really was, so he got back into the car and drove off.",high5217.txt
