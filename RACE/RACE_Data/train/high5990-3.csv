3,C,"[""Bernard Shaw didn't finish high school, nor did Edison."", ""One must think carefully before pursuing a master's degree."", 'The higher your education level, the more money you will earn.', ""If you are too well-educated, you'll be overeducated for society's demands.""]",Which of the following is NOT true?,"When your parents advise you to ""get an education"" in order to raise your income, they tell you only half the truth.

Get a high school diploma, at least. Without that, you will be occupationally dead unless your name happens to be George Bernard Shaw or Thomas Alva Edison, and you can successfully dropout in grade school.
Get a college degree, if possible. With a B. A., you are on the launching pad. But now you have to start to put on the brakes. If you go for a master's degree, make sure it is an M.B.A., and the famous law of diminishing  returns begins to take effect.

If you become a doctor in English or history or anthropology or political science or languages or--worst of all--in philosophy, you run the risk of becoming overeducated for our national demands. Not for our needs, mind you, but for our demands.
Thousands of doctors are selling shoes, driving cars, waiting on table, and endlessly filling out applications month after month. They may also take a job in some high school or backwater  college that pays much less than the doorkeeper earns.
You can equate the level of income with the level of education only so far. Far enough, that is, to make you useful to the gross national product, but not so far that nobody can turn much of a profit on you.",high5990.txt
