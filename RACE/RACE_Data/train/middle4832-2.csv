2,D,"['the plants can grow well only with the sunlight', 'there are all kinds of plants on the earth', 'maple leaves change the color as other trees', 'not all the colors of the leaves are from chlorophyll']",This passage tells us  _  .,"Do you want to know how and why a fall leaf changes color? We first have to understand what leaves are and what they do.
Leaves are the world's food factories. Plants take water from the ground through their roots and take CO2from the air. Plants use sunlight to turn water and CO2into glucose , a kind of sugar. Plants use it as food for energy and growing.
A chemical called _ in the leaves gives plants their green colour. As summer ends and autumn comes, the days get shorter and shorter, and trees ""know"" to begin getting ready for winter.
During winter, there is not enough sunlight or water. Trees rest during this time and live on the food they store during the summer. They begin to shut down their food-making factories. As the green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves, we begin to see yellow and orange leaves.
The bright reds and purples we see in leaves are made mostly in autumn. In some trees, like maples , sunlight and the cool nights of autumn turn the glucose in the leaves into a red colour. And we can enjoy the beautiful red leaves during autumn.",middle4832.txt
