Maybe you don't have the option.Combining work and motherhood is an issue faced by increasing numbers of women every day.
New research for the Institute for Economic and Social Research could solve this quandary once and for all.In short,it concludes that going back to work after the birth of a child can have a negative impact on the child's development--unless you have lots of money.
""Growing up in a family in which the mother chooses to work appears to have some adverse consequences for children's welfare,"" the research says.However,it adds that extra money brought in by both parents can reduce the negative effect.The negative effect is also less apparent in children of bettereducated mothers.
The research by John Ermisch and Marco Francesconi is especially downbeat about welfare to work programmes,and especially,the prospects for the children of some single parents.
""It is hard to see anything but gloomy   prospects for the children of single parents (who are generally poor),"" the researchers said.This is because in a common family where both parents work,extra money brought in by the mother's working would compensate for less time spent with the children.
In contrast,the researchers said the effects of paternal   employment were far more modest,but this did not mean that fathers had no role in shaping their children's welfare.Money brought in by the father would be a major resource for helping children develop.
The research says,however,that before parents get too carried away by worrying about working,there are more important issues facing a child's development.Parents' personalities and emotional stability,parenting practices,and the friends and networks that children experience while growing up will be much bigger factors than whether their mothers work.",high6193.txt
