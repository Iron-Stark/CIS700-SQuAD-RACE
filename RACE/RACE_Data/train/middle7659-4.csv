4,A,"['the teacher taught his student something useful', 'the teacher wanted his student to work hard', 'the student knew how to make the water clear', 'the student was very lazy']",From the passage we know that  _,"One day a famous teacher was walking with his student. On the way, they saw a lake. They stopped and the teacher told the student, ""I'm thirsty. Get me some water from that lake.""
Just when the student reached the lake, a cow was walking in the lake. So the water became very dirty. He thought ""I can't give the dirty water to my teacher!""
He came back and told the teacher, ""The water is very dirty. We can't drink it."" After about half an hour, the teacher asked the student to get some water again. So he went back to the lake.
But the lake was still dirty. So he told the teacher the same thing. After some time, the teacher asked him to go back again. But this time, he found the water was clear. The mud in the water came to the bottom. So he got some water.
The teacher looked at the water and said to him, ""You did nothing to make the water clear. You just let it be. Your mind is also like that! When it is bothered , just let it be. Give it some time.""",middle7659.txt
