2,C,"['is not worried about Tom', 'feels very happy', 'is not rich', 'likes new technology']",From the passage we know that Tom's mother  _  .,"Dear Abby,
I'm a helpless mother.My son Tom is 15 years old.I find that the older he grows,the less we talk.I feel very sad and I really need help.
My first problem is about his hobbies.He spends almost all his spare time on computer games.When he gets home.he always turns on the computer and closes the door.I'm getting worried about him,especially when his English teacher tells me he always gets low marks in the English exams.
Second,he likes new technology,but I don't have enough money and I can't afford all the things he wants.
Recently,I've found that he is always alone.I've never seen him talking to his friends on the phone or going out with anyone on weekends.That is the last problem I have.
What should I do to help him?Please give me some advice.
