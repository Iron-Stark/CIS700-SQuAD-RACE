Be outgoing , get out of the house and do things with other people. It's easier to make friends when you follow these:
Show people what you are good at. Talk about the things you like and you do best. People will be interested in you if there is something interesting.
Look people in the eye  when talking with them. That way, they'll find it easier to talk to you, or people may think you're not interested in them and stop being interested in you.
Be a good listener. Let people talk about themselves before talking about yourself. Ask lots of questions. Show an interest in their answers.
Make friends with the people you really like, not just with those who are easy to meet. Be friendly to people. That way, you'll have a bigger group of people to choose and more chances for making friends.",middle1021.txt
