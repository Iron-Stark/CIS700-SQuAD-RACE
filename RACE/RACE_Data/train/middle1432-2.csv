When he was not far from his house, the light on the cart went out. He tried but could not mend   it. He was near his home, and so he went along the road without a light. When a policeman saw this, he stopped the old carter.
""Where is your light?"" asked the policeman. ""No man may take a cart along the road at night without a light. You know that. You have broken the law  ."" ""I had a light, but it has just gone out,"" said the old man.
""I don't believe that story,"" said the policeman. He took out a book and got ready to write. What's your name and where do you live?"" he asked.
""Please don't take my name,"" said the old man. ""My home is just there. You can see it from here. I had a light nearly the whole way. I haven't come far without a light.""
""You came all the way without a light. What's your name?""
The carter quickly took the policeman's hand and put it down on top of the light. The light was still hot and burnt the policeman's hand. The policeman jumped and he was very angry. ""Now, what do you think?"" said the carter. ""Did I come all the way without a light?""",middle1432.txt
