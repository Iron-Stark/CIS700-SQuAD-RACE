2,A,"['Eating vegetables', 'Excising', 'Smoking', 'Drinking alcohol']",Which is not mentioned   in order to develop good sleeping habits in the passage?,"One in every five young people has a sleep problem, so you're not alone; Getting enough sleep has become as important as eating vegetables and exercising regularly. It's very important for your body. 
Most young people only get seven hours of sleep each night, when they actually need nine hours. And making up for lost sleep during the week by sleeping in on weekends doesn't really work. In fact, sleeping late on weekends may actually do you more harm than good, if you have sleep problems.
What happens if you don't get enough sleep? If your sleep problem continues for a few nights, you could suffer serious problems. Lack of sleep can affect learning and memory. Worse , if your sleep difficulties last a long time , that could lead to anxiety or depression . Therefore, you've got to have some healthy sleep habits. Below are some suggestions:
* GO TO BED AT THE SAME TIME--including weekends , if possible .
* WAKE UP AROUND THE SAME TIME EVERY MORNING . When you sleep late just one morning during the week, it may disturb your body clock. This will make it hard for you to sleep that night.
* DO SMOETHING REALXING before going to bed .
* EXERCISE DURING THE DAY . Don't exercise right before going to bed.
* AVOID DRINKING ALCOHOL. Alcohol makes you excited. This prevents you from falling asleep or wakes you up during the night.
* DON'T SMOKE . Smoking is always bad for the body. Smoking before bedtime keeps you awake.
If trying these tips over a couple of weeks does not help you, speak to your doctor. Do not take any sleeping pills without first asking your doctor. Many have strong side effects.",high20629.txt
