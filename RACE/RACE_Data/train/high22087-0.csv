0,D,"['Because she wanted to be one of the characters in the book.', 'Because she wanted to get higher scores in the job interviews.', ""Because she wanted to follow her friend's example mentioned in the passage."", 'Because the successful characters in the books she read were attractive.']",Why did the author want to have a good appearance when she was young?,"I once thought that outer beauty is the only factor to become a great person.When I was young,I read many kinds of books,most of which described characters who are handsome or beautiful. So I think that being beautiful is the only way to become a success.
     As I grew up,the story of my best friend made me realize that outer beauty was not so important to make a person successful.She as so beautiful a girl that every classmate liked to chat with her,but she was very arrogant.In her opinion,she could get all she wanted because of her beauty, but all of her friends left her one by one! Only then did she come to know the importance of the beauty in a person's heart,which changed her attitude and she made friends again. 
Turning on TV,we can see many advertisements,most of which seem to give us a feeling that,physical attractiveness is the most important thing.T _ .It is surprising that more and more people,especially girls and women, try it like the first man-made beauty in China, Hao Lulu.It is a common sense that attractive people can easily find work.Most good looking guys,usually get higher scores in the job interviews.
