3,C,"[""means that one can ignore other people's criticism"", 'means that one can impose his preferences on others', ""doesn't mean that one has the right to do things at will"", ""doesn't mean that one has the right to charge others without evidence(C)""]","As indicated in the passage, being free to act on one's opinion   _  .","""Opinion"" is a word that is used carelessly today. It is used to refer to matters of taste, belief, and judgment. This casual use would probably cause little confusion if people didn't attach too much importance to opinion. Unfortunately, most to attach great importance to it. ""I have as much right to my opinion as you to yours,"" and ""Everyone's entitled to his opinion,"" are common expressions. In fact, anyone who would challenge another's opinion is likely to be branded intolerant.
Is that label accurate? Is it intolerant to challenge another's opinion? It depends on what definition of opinion you have in mind. For example, you may ask a friend ""What do you think of the new Ford cars?"" And he may reply, ""In my opinion, they're ugly."" In this case, it would not only be intolerant to challenge his statement, but foolish. For it's obvious that by opinion he means his personal preference, a matter of taste. And as the old saying goes, ""It's pointless to argue about matters of taste.""
But consider this very different use of the term, a newspaper reports that the Supreme Court has delivered its opinion in a controversial case. Obviously the justices did not shale their personal preferences, their mere likes and dislikes, they stated their considered judgment, painstakingly arrived at after thorough inquiry and deliberation.
Most of what is referred to as opinion falls somewhere between these two extremes. It is not an expression of taste. Nor is it careful judgment. Yet it may contain elements of both. It is a view or belief more or less casually arrived at, with or without examining the evidence.
Is everyone entitled to his opinion? Of course, this is not only permitted, but guaranteed. We are free to act on our opinions only so long as, in doing so, we do not harm others.",high18423.txt
