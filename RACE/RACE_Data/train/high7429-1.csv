1,D,"['shocked', 'worried', 'embarrassed', 'relieved']","When Mr. Smith learned that the woman didn't know who he was, he felt   _  .","Mr. Smith is well known in Washington because of his many social blunders. He always likes to attend the various social functions because he wants to expand his circle of friends. Whenever he is invited, he goes, unless he is ill.
Recently he received an invitation to a fashionable banquet. Although he did not know the hostess, he accepted the invitation. He was secretly very pleased, because he felt that his reputation as a desirable guest was growing.
When he arrived at the banquet hall, he found that about one hundred people had been invited. He began to move a-round the hall. He spoke to other guests whether he knew them or not. He soon realized that he had never met any of the other people present, although they seemed to know each other.
At dinner he was seated beside a very dignified woman. The woman tried to be friendly even though she had never met Mr. Smith before. She spoke politely whenever he spoke to her. Between the first and the second course of the meal, she, turned to Mr. Smith and said, ""Do you see that gray-haired man at the end of the table? The one with glasses.""
""Ah, yes. Who is he?""
""He's the Secretary of the Interior!"" she replied.
Mr. Smith said, ""So that's the secretary of the Interior! I' m afraid that I find very little to admire about him, although he is the Secretary.""
The woman stiffened and did not reply. Mr. Smith continued in spite of her coldness. ""I really can't see how he received his appointment unless he is perhaps a relative of the President.""
""It hardly matters whether you like the Secretary or not,"" she said. ""He was chosen because the President thought he was the man for the job. If he does the job well, you should have no complaint.""
""That's just it,"" persisted Mr. Smith. ""No one does the things he does, unless he is a complete fool!""
""Sir!"" said the woman in all her dignity. ""Do you know who I am?"" ""No,"" replied Mr. Smith.
""I am the Secretary's wife,"" she said coldly. Mr. Smith was shocked, but he went on in spite of his embarrassment. ""Madam, do you know who I am?""
""No, I don't,"" the woman replied.
""Thank goodness!"" exclaimed Mr. Smith, as he quickly left the table.",high7429.txt
