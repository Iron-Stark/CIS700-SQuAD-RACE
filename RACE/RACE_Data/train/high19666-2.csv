Product Description
Use the power of steam to clean and disinfect your home in minutes without using expensive and harmful detergents .
Perfect for use throughout the home, this steam mop heats up almost instantly and takes just eight seconds to kill bacteria from any area it targets.
It works by changing water into steam using a microfiber cloth to enhance the ability to absorb liquid, and features a clever triangular mop head and swivel joint to allow it to reach into comers and other spaces that many similar cleaning tools cannot. The 1,300W motor helps the mop reach temperatures of between 90-100degC, making it suitable for all heat-resistant floors including hardwood, tiles and stone.
Comes apart for easy storage. 2 x microfiber cloths included.
Additional pack if three spare mop heads are also available
