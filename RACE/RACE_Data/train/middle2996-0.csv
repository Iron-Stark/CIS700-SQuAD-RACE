0,D,"['The host talks little with the visitor.', 'The child accompanies the visitor to the gate of the house.', 'The host offers the visitor a seat only.', 'The visitor takes some food with him when he leaves.']",Which of the following is TRUE to the passage?,"Akuapem is in the eastern part of Ghana. The sun there shines all the time. The local people are very friendly and hospitable . Now let's have a look at how Akuapem people receive a visitor.
A visitor is often welcomed warmly in a family of Akuapem. After the visitor is welcomed into the house, he is offered a seat and water at the very beginning, because the host _ that the visitor must have come from a very long journey and need water. If there is a group of visitors, the host will greet the visitors from right to left. And the host shakes only with his right hand, because Akuapem people think the left hand is not clean.
Next, the visitor is asked how his journey was and why he has come. While the conversation is going on, the wife and the children, especially girls, are preparing food for the visitor. The visitor can choose his favorite food. After the visitor finishes eating, the host and the visitor go on with their conversation. Usually this is short one because the visitor is getting ready to say goodbye.
When the visitor is leaving, he is often given some food. He is also accompanied  by one of the children to the nearest station. The child who accompanies the visitor will not come back home until the visitor leaves safely.
Whether he is a close friend or just a stranger, this is always how friendly Akuapem people receive a visitor.",middle2996.txt
