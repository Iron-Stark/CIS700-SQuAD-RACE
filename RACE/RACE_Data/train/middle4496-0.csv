0,C,"['Money is everything.', ""Money isn't necessary."", 'Money is important,but not the most important.', 'With no money,with no success.']","According to the passage,which of the following do you think is right?","In today's world many people seem to be hungry for money. Some of them even lose their lives for it. Money does have its most useful effect on the poor,but once a person has a rich life,a lot more money doesn't mean more happiness.
If money was everything,all millionaires would have true love, true friendship,good health and a long life. However,this is not always true.
Nothing else is more pleasant than the three words which are ""I love you"". But can love be bought?I'm afraid not. Love means to give,not to take. To every person,health and long life are probably the most precious things. Well,can health and a long life be bought with money?The answer is ""No"".
Of all the longest living people in the world, few of them are millionaires. True friendship can't be bought either. In a word,Where money is worshiped ,money can cause brothers to quarrel,lovers to hate,strangers to fight and so on. No matter how much money you have,it is still not enough to make you a happy person  if you have no one to laugh with,no one to cry for.",middle4496.txt
