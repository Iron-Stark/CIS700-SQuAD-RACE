1,B,"['Her home address.', 'Her full name.', ""Her boss's name."", 'Her new job.']",.What did Steve find about his mother online in 2007?,"Steve knew he'd been adopted as a baby, and when he turned 18, in 2003, he decided he'd try to track down his birth mother. The agency from which he'd been adopted gave him his mother's name: Tallady. But online searches didn't turn up any results about it, and Steve had to let it go.
In 2007, though, he searched for the name again online. This time, the search results included a home address near the Lowe's store where Steve, then 22, worked as a deliveryman. When he mentioned the coincidence to his boss, his boss said, ""You mean Tallady, who works here?""
Steve and Tallady, a cashier, had said hello to each other a few times at the store, but they'd never really talked. He hadn't even known her name. Steve thought there was no possible way she was his mother though they shared the same name. For a few months, Steve avoided Tallady. ""I wasn't sure how to approach her,"" he told a local reporter. Finally, the agency volunteered to arrange their reunion.
When Tallady realized that the nice guy she'd been waving at was his son, she sobbed. She'd always hoped to meet her birth son one day. Later that day, mother and son talked for almost three hours at a nearby bar. She'd given him up for adoption in 1985, when she was 23. ""I wasn't ready to be a mother,"" she told him. Married with two other children, Tallady says, ""I have a complete family now.""",high6642.txt
