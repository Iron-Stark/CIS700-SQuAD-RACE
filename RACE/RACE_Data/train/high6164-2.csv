2,D,"['the batteries are of poor quality', 'there was no coverage for phone reception', ""batteries can't be charged in such conditions"", 'the extreme coldness makes the batteries lose power']",Mobile phones would not work in Oymyakon because   _  .,"With the average temperature for January standing at -50 degC,it is no wonder the Russian village of Oymyakon is the coldest permanently inhabited settlement in the world.Known as the""Pole of Cold"",the coldest ever temperature recorded in Oymyakon is -71.2 degC.This is the lowest recorded temperature for any permanently inhabited location on Earth and the lowest temperature recorded in the northern hemisphere .
Ironically,Oymyakon actually means""nonfreezing water""due to a nearby hot spring.Most homes in Oymyakon still burn coal and wood for heat and enjoy few modern conveniences.
Nothing grows there so people eat reindeer meat and horsemeat.A single shop provides the town's bare necessities and the locals work as reindeerbreeders,hunters and icefishermen.
There are few modern conveniences in the village--with many buildings still having outdoor toilets--and most people still burn coal and wood for heat.When coal deliveries are irregular,the power station starts burning wood.If the power ceases,the town shuts down in about five hours,and the pipes freeze and crack.
Daily problems that come with living in Oymyakon include pen ink freezing,glasses freezing to people's faces and batteries losing power.Locals are said to leave their cars running all day for fear of not being able to restart them.Even if there was coverage for mobile phone reception,the phones themselves would not work in such conditions.
Another problem caused by the frozen temperatures is burying dead bodies,which can take anything up to three days.The earth must first have thawed sufficiently in order to dig it,so a bonfire is lit for a couple of hours.Hot coals are then pushed to the side and a hole couple of inches deep is dug.The process is repeated for several days until the hole is deep enough to bury the coffin.
Travel companies offer tourists the opportunity to visit the village and sample life in the freezing conditions.",high6164.txt
