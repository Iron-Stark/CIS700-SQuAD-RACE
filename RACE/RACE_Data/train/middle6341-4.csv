4,C,"['Travel in the forest.', 'Spend a night in the forest.', 'What to do when get lost in the forest', 'What to do if we want to get some water.']",What's the best title for the passage?,"If you go into the forest with your friends, stay with them. If you don't, you may get lost. What should you do if you really get lost? You should sit down and stay where you are. You mustn't try to find your friends. Let them find you. If you want your friends to find you, you need to stay in one place. You can also shout three times. Then stop. Then shout three times again. Keep up shouting. Always three times together. When people hear you, they will know you need help and where you are.
If you don't think that you can get help before night comes, you should make a little house with some small trees or branches  or something else. And make yourself a bed with leaves or grass. When you need some water and you have to leave your little house to look for it, don't just walk away. Leave small branches or something else on the way and then you can find your way back easily.",middle6341.txt
