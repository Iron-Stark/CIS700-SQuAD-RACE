Subject: Hello!
Hi, Liam!
So you're my new pen friend. Let me tell you a bit about myself. I'm 14 years old and I live in
Calgary, Canada. I have two older brothers, Brian and Sam. I'm the only girl.
I love sports and I'm always looking for exciting new hobbies to try. I like playing baseball in winter.
It's fun beating the boys! But summer is my favourite time of the year. I love skateboarding and
rock climbing in summer.
Skateboarding's great because it's so fun and easy to learn! I often skateboard after school. There
are many places in the park where I can do stunts. I'm good at stunts like jumping and turning the
skateboard!
Rock climbing is also really fun. I usually climb with my dad on weekends. We can't do it on real
mountains very often because we live in the city. We do indoor rock climbing instead but it's not as
challenging.
So that's me! How about you? Please write back soon!
Bye for now!
