0,D,"['An emergency room physician.', 'A researcher.', 'A public relations worker.', 'An artist.']",What's Irina's job now?,"Irina,now 46,never imagined she'd one day make a living as a balloon artist.The daughter of an engineer and a teacher,she won top academic awards in high school,went on to medical school and became an emergency room physician in a small city.
""I loved the science of medicine,"" she says today,""but being a doctor was very hard.I saw things people don't normally see--women giving birth in the street,people getting drunk and killing someone."" Medications were scarce,making it very difficult to treat those in need.When Irina was 33,a girlfriend showed her a magazine photo of an American named Wes Patterson.They began exchanging letters,and married that December.Irina took a public relations job.Then,a few years ago,she watched a man at a party twist a skinny balloon into the shape of a dog. _ 
Irina soon purchased a tiny pump and a supply of balloons and began practicing on the sidewalks.Observers challenged her to create all kinds of figures.Now,Irina says,""There's nothing I can't make.""
Many years ago,Irina's husband developed a serious disease which now keeps him homebound.""But he is a very wonderful man,"" Irina says.Thanks to her new career,she is able to support them both,performing about five events weekly and earning as much as  $2,000 per appearance.
