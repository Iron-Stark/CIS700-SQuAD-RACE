0,D,"['students who visit the website ""revise. it"" are all lazy', 'students in Oxford University are all lazy', 'websites in Oxford University are all set up by students', 'websites can provide people with different kinds of information']",It can be inferred from this passage that    _   .,"London-Lazy students can now give up on work altogether as two Oxford University students have made scores of A-grade essays on the website for students to copy.
The essays are on the new website, ""revise.it""
The website includes an ""EssayLab"" designed to make cheating   as effective and effortless as possible.
Its homepage announces to surfers  : ""The revise.it EssayLab is a bank of hundreds of A-Level essays covering popular topics.""
""Next time you are asked to write an essay, why not see what we have on the subject-if you are in a lazy state of mind you can even use our guide to writing the essays and then just hand them in.""
Nick Rose and Jordan Mayo, both 19 and first from Manchester, spent much of their first year as students at the university setting up the website. There is no charge for downloading the essays.
""I have never been very good at essay writing,"" Rose admitted. ""We don't see essay bank as a cheating way. It's a surprising valuable resource. You can learn a lot by reading other people's work on the subject.""
Among other tips, the website suggests inventing important speeches to give essays extra weight: ""Popular people to quote   are Douglass Hurd or Disraeli.""
Hurd was a foreign secretary in the 1980s and Disraeli was a 19
century prime minister.
Teachers are expressing their opinions by e-mail that they are angry about the website that ""encourages students to cheat"", but students disagree.
According to Rose: ""Exams are a fight. It's us against them.""",high16563.txt
