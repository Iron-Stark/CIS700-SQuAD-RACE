But Mom and Dad are two of the most important people in your life. Over your lifetime, they may influence  you more than anyone else you will meet. Moms and Dads need to care for their kids every day. Most parents will do _ as long as they live.
There are many ways to stay close, to get along well and to build a strong relationship  with your parents. Here are some of them:
Spend time together. Don't play computer games or watch TV alone. Ask your mom and dad to play with you. Go outside together, or do some reading.
Be kind. Little things might mean a lot to your mom or dad. You can give your parents a happy day with a card or a joke. It's also lovely when a kid cleans up his or her room without being asked. And if you try not fight with your brothers or sisters, your parents will be so happy.
Do your best at whatever you do. You don't have to be the best, but when you do your best, you make your parents proud . It makes them happy to see how you are turning into a good kid. Why? Because it lets them know they are doing a good job.",middle2708.txt
