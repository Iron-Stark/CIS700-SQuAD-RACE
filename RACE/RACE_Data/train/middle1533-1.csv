1,B,"['They look like Americans but they think like Chinese.', 'They look like Chinese but they think like Americans.', 'They like to eat bananas.', 'They can speak ""ABC"" very well.']","Why do people call an ""ABC"" a ""banana person""?","""ABC""and ""Banana Persons""
You may know the English letters A, B and C. But do you know there are people called ""ABC""? You may like eating bananas. But do you know there are people called ""banana persons""? If you don't know, I will tell you. They are Chinese people like you and me, but they aren't in China.Why do people call them like that?
""ABC"" means American-born Chinese. An ""ABC"" is a Chinese,
but was born in the United States. Sometimes, people also call them
""banana persons"". A banana is yellow outside and white inside. So when
a person is a banana, he or she is white (American) inside and yellow (Chinese)
outside.
They are born in America and they live in America for a long time. Even
their nationality  is American. So they think like Americans and do things
like Americans. But they still have Chinese blood . Their parents, grandparents
or even great-grandparents were from China.They all have black eyes and black hair.
So they look like us Chinese people. For example, we all know the famous scientist
C.N.Yang. He is an ""ABC"" and he is a ""banana person"". We like him, although 
his nationality isn't Chinese.",middle1533.txt
