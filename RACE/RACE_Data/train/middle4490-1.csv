1,C,"['The rooms in the new flat are big.', 'The rooms in the old flat were smaller.', 'There are more rooms in the new flat.', 'There are more rooms in the old flat.']",What is the difference between the old flat and the new one?,"Dear Kitty:
News! We have a new flat! The rooms are small, but they are comfortable. There are more rooms here than in our old flat. This is good because now I have my own room. In the old flat, I share with my sister.
My bedroom is my favourite room in our flat. I can be alone in it. I can read or draw. I can listen to my radio or play CDs. I can play games on my computer and send e-mails to my friends.
My second favorite room is the kitchen. I love helping my mother cook our meals. She is a very good cook. She is teaching me how to make many different kinds of dishes. She lived in Morocco when she was a girl, and she can cook Moroccan food. It's very delicious. That's all for now.
Write soon and tell me about your home. Please get on the Internet so that we can send e-mails to each other.
All good wishes!
