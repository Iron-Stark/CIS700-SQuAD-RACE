2,C,"['getting educated', 'getting trained', 'getting married', 'getting improved']",What does the phrase getting hitched probably mean in the passage?,"In nowadays,people tend to get married late.Does it have advantage or disadvantage?Different people have different opinions.Now let's have a look at a telated study about Americans.
A study has found that marrying later in life is generally financially benfeicial for women,but not for men.
The University of Virginia has published a report that college-educated women who get married in their thirties earn an average of 56 percent more than those who wed a decade earlier.
In contrast,men who settle down in their twenties have higher intomes than those who wait until after 30,whatever their education.
The Natioal Marriage Project's study,with the title:The Benefits and Costs of Delayed Marriage in America,examines the consequences of marrying later,a growing trend in the US.
It notes that the average age of marriage is ag an all-time high of 27 for women and 29 for men,compared to 1990 when the averages were 23 for women and 26for men.
But while wome have actually benefited financially from delayed marriages,men who getmarried earlier in life tend to be more successful later on.
The study says that childbirth plays a role in these results.
Around tow-thirds of lifetime income growth takes place during the first ten years of a career,according to clinical psychologist Meg Jay.
Since college-educated women who marry in their twenties also tend to have their first baby earlier,forcing them to take a break from their careers.
But getting hiched at a younger age tends to be a good career move for men,perhaps because married men are more sure of themselves and they have more responsibility for their family compared to single men ,leadng to more productivity,suggests Business Insider.
The study also found that while college-deucated women profit from delayed marriage,those without a degree do not.
In fact,among women who drop out of high school, 83 percent of first births are to unmarried mothers,according to the study.
A woman without a college education therefore has less time to advance her career during ist vital first decade.
The study also shows that men who never marry earn significantly less than those who do ,while the opposite is true for women.",high23733.txt
