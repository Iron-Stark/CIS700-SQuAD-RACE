Carole Kyle from Sydney.Carole has brought along some brochures about Project Hope which
supports Chinese students who drop out of school due to poverty.
    China's Ambassador to Australia Ma Zhao xu hopes that this kind of event will facilitate a
dialogue between people from the two countries.
    ""In Chinese culture,we appreciate unity without uniformity,and harmony in diversity.
Australian culture welcomes cultural diversity,so that is a good foundation for Sino-Australian
relations,to further our understandings and strengthen our friendship.""Ma said.
    Sydney's mayor Clover Moore was also present and echoed Ma's view.
    ""In fact we have Chinese living in Australia since the middle of the 19th century,so it
 goes way back and there has been a strong link between China and Australia for many many
 years.We have a very ancient culture here,the aboriginal culture.You have a very ancient
culture in China.We'd like to marry those two and celebrate them.""Moore said.
    A centre about Chinese culture in Sydney is also set to have a test run in March,and will
be the biggest of its kind in the Oceania region.",high17413.txt
