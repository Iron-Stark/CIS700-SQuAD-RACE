2,A,"[""The girl's love for her brother."", ""The girl's money."", 'The medicine from the drugstore.', 'Nobody can tell.']",What made the miracle happen?,"An eight-year-old child heard her parents talking about her little brother. All she knew was that he was very sick and they had no money. Only a very expensive operation   could save him now and there was no one to lend them the money. When she heard her daddy say to her tearful mother, ""Only a miracle   can save him now,"" the little girl went to her bedroom and pulled her money from its hiding place and counted it carefully. She ran to a drugstore with the money in her hand.
""And what do you want?"" asked the salesman.
""It's for my little brother,"" the girl answered. ""He's really, really sick and I want to buy a miracle.""
""Pardon?"" said the salesman.
""My brother Andrew has something bad growing inside his head and my daddy says only a miracle can save him. So how much does a miracle cost?""
""We don't sell a miracle here, child. I'm sorry,"" the salesman said with a smile.
""Listen, if it isn't enough, I can try and get some more. Just tell me how much it costs.""
A well-dressed man heard it and asked, ""What kind of a miracle does your brother need?""
""I don't know,"" she answered with her eyes full of tears. ""He's really sick and mum says he needs an operation. But my daddy can't pay for it, so I have brought all my money.""
""How much do you have?"" asked the man.
""$ 1.11, but I can try and get some more,"" she answered.
""Well, what luck,"" smiled the man. ""$ 1.11, the price of a miracle for little brothers."" He took up the girl's hand and said, ""Take me to where you live. I want to see your brother and meet your parents. Let's see if I have the kind of miracle you need.""
That well-dressed man was Dr Carlton Armstrong, a famous doctor. The operation was successful and it wasn't long before Andrew was home again
