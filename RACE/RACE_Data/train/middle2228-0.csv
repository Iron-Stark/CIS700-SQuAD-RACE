People who are nearsighted  can only see things that are very close to their eyes. Many people who do a lot of close work, such as writing and reading, become nearsighted. Then they have to wear glasses in order to see distant things clearly.
People who are farsighted face just the opposite problem. They can see things that are far away, but they have difficulty reading a book if they don't hold it at arm's length. If they want to do much reading, they must get glasses too.

However, this mistake happens because the center of the eye, which is very sensitive   in daylight, is not as sensitive as the sides of the eye after dark,",middle2228.txt
