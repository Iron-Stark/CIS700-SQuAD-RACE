Whenever I faced disappointment, my mother would say this to me.
After I graduated from college in 1932, I decided to find a job in radio as a sports announcer. I went to Chicago and knocked at the door of every station. But unluckily , I was refused every time.
At one station, a kind lady told me that big stations wouldn't hire   an inexperienced person and suggested that I try my luck at smaller stations. Following her advice, I went back to Dixon, where I had grown up. There were no radio-announcing jobs in Dixon, and my father said a newly-opened store wanted a local athlete to work for it. I applied for the job, but I was refused again.
""Everything happens for the best,"" Mom reminded me. Dad offered me the car to look for a job. I tried WOC Radio in Davenport, Iowa. The program director, Peter MacArthur, told me they had already hired an announcer.
As I left his office, my frustration(,) boiled over. ""How can I become a sports announcer if I can't get a job in a radio station?"" I asked aloud.
While I was waiting for the elevator, I heard someone calling. It was MacArthur. ""What was that you said about sports? Do you know anything about football?"" Then he asked me to broadcast   an imaginary game. Pleased with my performance, he offered me a chance to work there.
On my way home, I thought of my mother's words: ""If you carry on, one day something good will happen. Something wouldn't have happened if not for"" that previous disappointment.",middle6022.txt
