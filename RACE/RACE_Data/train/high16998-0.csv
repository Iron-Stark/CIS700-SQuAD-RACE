0,D,"['tried to see her husband', 'wanted to look perfect', 'was a little worried about her appearance', 'needed an examination for her baby']",Sam visited the doctor probably because she   _  .,"Samantha, or Sam, as her husband, John, called her, had left the doctor's house looking perfect, satisfied with her appearance.
The year was 1862. It seemed that the war with the North would never come to an end. Sam's father had left as soon as possible, swearing that he'd fight for Virginia, for their land, for their new government, for God, for the South.
At last, Samantha reached the house that she and John owned. It was a cold, rainy night, and she was glad to be home. She stepped into the sitting room. John rested in an armchair, reading a book. He glanced at her, put the book down, and stood, reaching his arms out for her. They kissed briefly. He put a hand to her now slightly round belly and asked, ""What did the doctor say?""
""He said the baby was fine and that I seemed healthy. Do you have any news?""
""Surprisingly, yes."" John hesitated for a moment, as if deciding how he would phrase what he was about to say, and then unwillingly continued, ""I've been demanded to join the army.""
Sam screamed, ""What?"" She was near tears. ""But-but we're just starting out."" Her voice shook. ""I thought that after two years of begging my mother to let the two of us get married that our life would finally be happy. Isn't there any way you can get out of this?""
John answered, ""I'm afraid not.""
  ""Please. Please, John, if you love me, please get out of this. Break a leg, fake an illness, 
do something."" She began to sob. John comforted her, resting her head on his shoulder. 
""Sam.""
""What?""
""Name the child after me; name it John or Joanna. I'll come back as soon as I can. I promise.""
Sam smiled into his collar bone, knowing that John lived by his word. He never broke a promise. She pressed her hand to her belly, and, unknown to her, the baby was a girl.
And unknown to both of them, the promise that John had just made would be the only promise he would ever break.",high16998.txt
