Heyokah Photos
My personal photography projects are concerned with the beauty in the ordinary. I like to celebrate real people and the way they interact with their surroundings and material possession. I also etcate images for businesses and performers in a documentary style, trying to get beneath the hype  and show something about who they really are. These photos are part of my recent project: Boater on the Kennet and Avon Canal. Contact: www.ehyokah.co.uk
Hannah Bartlett
The garments are a mix of tailored wools and leather. I trained as the UCA as a creative pattern cutter so I like my work to be cut in a creative way. It is important for me not to waste too much fabric so I like to make some garments out of leftovers. Email: hannanh-bartlett@botmail.co.uk",high6944.txt
