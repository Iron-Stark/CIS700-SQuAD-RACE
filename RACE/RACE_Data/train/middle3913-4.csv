One way to keep fish for future use is canning it. We'll have this article describing, step by step, how to prepare dried fish.
Begin with fish that are out of the water. If the fish are small, leave their heads on. Cut off the heads if the fish are longer than twenty centimeters or weigh more than one hundred fifteen grams.
Now clean the freshly caught fish. Cut off the scales and cut open the stomach. Remove everything inside. Then wash the fish in clean water and fill salt into them.
Next, put the fish in a container with a solution   of three hundred grams of salt and one liter of water. This will remove the blood from the meat. Keep the fish in the saltwater for about thirty minutes. After that , wash them again in clean water.
Next, put the fish in a solution that has more salt in the water. The water should be salty enough so that the fish can float to the top. If the fish sink to the bottom of the container, add more salt to the water.
Cover the container with a clean piece of wood. Place a heavy stone on the wood to hold it down. Leave the fish there for about six hours.
After that, remove them from the saltwater and place them on a clean surface. Cover the fish with a clean piece of white cloth and let them dry.
