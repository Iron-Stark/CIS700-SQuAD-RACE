2,B,"['He will go to the Great Wall.', 'He will stay at home.', 'He will take photos for his friends.', 'He will travel to other places.']",What do you think the writer will do next National Day?,"Are you sorry for not travelling during the National Day ? if you stay at home at that time, I think you are very lucky. why? because there are too many people everywhere. in many places of interest in China, it's too _ to do anything.
it was too crowded on the great wall on October 1st, 2009. you even couldn't take photos for you or your friends. all what we could see were people. it was reported that there were about twenty people per meter on the great wall. my friends told me they could see nothing but many people on the great wall. ""we couldn't walk if the people in front of us didn't walk,"" he said. he showed us a photo on the great wall. in the photo, we hardly found him out, there were too many people.
so some people give the advice that we should not have the gold week   any more. but other people say no about this advice. what's your idea of it? Are you sorry now for not travelling during the gold week? I love staying at home more than travelling next National Day.",middle6301.txt
