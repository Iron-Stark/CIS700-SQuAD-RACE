It was 110 meters high. The center of the church was like a bell. The ceiling of the church was painted by a famous artist. They built a platform  so that the artist could put up a ladder on it and paint the ceiling. The platform was about 70 meters over the ground.
One day the artist was working hard and nearly finished one popular corner of the ceiling. Also on the platform was his assistant , who was mixing paints. The artist stepped back so that he could see how his work was doing. To have a better look at his painting, he stepped back again. _ 
""What do you think you are doing?"" he shouted angrily. ""Are you mad ?"" His assistant replied, ""I saw you walking backwards to have a better look at your painting. But you didn't notice that you reached the very edge  of the platform. You were in great danger. I wanted to make you move forwards. If I had not made you run forwards, you would have fallen backwards off the edge of the platform.""",middle7251.txt
