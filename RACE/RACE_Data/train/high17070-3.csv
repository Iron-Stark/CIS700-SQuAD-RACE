3,B,"['Lady Gaga has had only one US number one single.', 'Lady Gaga keeps a close contact with her fans.', ""Lady Gaga's influence is limited to America."", ""Lady Gaga ranked 10th in last year's Forbes Celebrity 100 list.""]",What can be inferred from the text?,"Just three years since Lady Gaga had her first US number one single, the pop star has claimed the top spot in Forbes magazine's annual Celebrity 100 list.
  The popular star moved up four positions from last year and has knocked TV chat show host Oprah Winfrey of the top spot. 
  But how has the singer become such a global phenomenon in such a short space of time ? Two experts in music, fashion and social networking give their opinions. 
George Ergatoudis ----Head of Music Radio1
  "" The key thing is Lady Gaga realized by using all the current social networking sites, and connecting that with her fashion, she has become an all-round star. Every time she goes out the door she looks different. She's getting photographed, she's aware of that and she's using it by updating her look literally on a daily basis.
  Another key thing wat that quite early on, her record label was showing how gifted she is as a musician. The music she makes, the songs she writes and the production she has are all brilliant contemporary pop music. She literally is turning into a global superstar.""
Calum Brannan ---Co-Founder of social Networking support company crowd Control HQ 
  ""Social media is a reflection  of what we love, so people are becoming very good at sharing exactly what they love and the brands and musicians they love.
   The fact she has 10 million Twitter followers and 30million Facebook fans is a massive reflection on Lady Gaga and the influence she has. Once out there, Twitter and Facebook help keep that person's profile  alive. Her fans are always talking about her and sharing everything she does even when she's not on stage or in concert.
  I think even if she wasn't on Facebook and Twitter, her fans and followers would put her there anyway. But the most important thing is,she is on there and she's using them.""",high17070.txt
