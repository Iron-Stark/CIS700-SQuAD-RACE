1,D,"['Because Sydney children watch less TV.', 'Because Sydney children have more eye resting time.', 'Because Sydney children use computers less.', 'Because Sydney children do more outdoor sports.']",Why are there fewer children with myopia in Sydney than in Singapore ?,"For better eyesight, doctors advise limiting the hours of screen time and encourage having enough eye resting time.
However, another study shows that sitting in front of computer or TV screens for long hours is not the only reason formyopia . An Australian research team studied young children in Sydney and Singapore to find the reasons for myopia.
The research team found that theprevalence of myopia among children in Sydney was lower than children in Singapore, even though they spent more time in front of computer and TV screens. The major finding is that children in Sydney spend longer hours on outdoor activities than those in Singapore.
Indoor and outdoor sports activities both make the eyes focus on more distant objects, which prevents the eyes from changing shape. But outdoor activities may better help avoid myopia than indoor sports activities.
Jane Gwiazda, who does research in sight problems, says: ""Natural light is good for eye growth. And extra vitamin D from the sun might contribute to eye growth.""
Many doctors suggest that every child get its first eye test done when he/she is about two and half years old, and even if his/her sight seems perfect.
It is necessary for myopic children to wear glasses to prevent headaches, trouble reading or injuries. It is also important that schools invite doctors to test their students' eyes.
If that is not possible, school teachers should at least encourage parents and children to have regular eye examinations and wear glasses. And parents should remember not only to limit the total screen time for their children, but also to encourage them to spend time outdoors.",high229.txt
