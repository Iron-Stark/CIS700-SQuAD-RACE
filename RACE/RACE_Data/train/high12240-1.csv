1,C,"['This will be the third time for Chinese astronauts to have a space walk.', 'Three of the six astronauts chosen for the mission will walk in space', 'The space walk will be live broadcast on TV', 'Everything has been prepared except communication system']",We can learn from the passage  _  .,"JIUQUAN, Gansu Province, Sept. 6(Xinhua) ---- China's manned spacecraft Shenzhou-7 will be launched at an appropriate time between Sept. 25 and 30 from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern Gansu Province, a spokesman said here on Saturday. The mission will accomplish the first spacewalk by Chinese astronauts.
""All the major systems involved in the launching are now in the final preparation. The main tests for the spacecraft, the Long-March II-F rocket, suits for the space walk and a satellite accompanying the fly have also been finished, "" said the spokesman.
In addition, the ground control system is fully prepared, including the launch site, the landing site, and the communication for observation and control.
When Shenzhou-7 enters its orbit, one of the three taikonauts will conduct a space walk, said Zhao Changxi, a senior scientist with the project, earlier.
According to Zhao, cameras would be fixed outside and inside of the ship for live broadcasting of the space walk.
While the last mission of Shenzhou-6, with a crew of two, was aimed at several days of manned flight, this time the task might be more stringent as one of its main goals is the space walk.
Earlier reports said a crew of six astronauts had been chosen for the mission, with three manning the spacecraft and three substitutes.
China successfully put two manned spacecrafts into orbit in 2003 and 2005 respectively, becoming the third country to send an astronaut into space after the United States and the former Soviet Union(now   Russia).",high12240.txt
