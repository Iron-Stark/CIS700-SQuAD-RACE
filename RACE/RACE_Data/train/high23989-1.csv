1,C,"[""mean you hasn't got ready"", 'will get lots of garbage', 'will get another ""you"" at once', ""don't want to copy yourself""]","When you press Ctrl + D, you_.","Over the next 20 to 50 years, it will become harder to tell the difference between the human and the machine. All body parts will be replaceable. A computer will function like the human brain with the ability to recognize feelings and respond with emotions. They can then make fake people. We will then be able to create a machine duplicate   of ourselves so we will appear to be alive long after we are dead. Maybe a few decades later, a way will be found to transfer our spirit to the new body. Then we can choose to live for as long as we want.
Once one of you is duplicated, you will just have to press Ctrl + D and you will have two of you. If you want 500, select 500. Naturally, when duplicates are running around all over the place, there will be a food problem.
The most practical choice would be garbage. Your modified duplicate will be made to eat garbage like a goat. But don't worry. Their taste buds and sense of smell will be changed so they will really enjoy it. They will want to eat lots of garbage.
When it becomes possible to do a spirit transfer, you will be able to live within whichever duplicate you want, whenever you want and as long as you want.
Just imagine what it would be like when you are with so many duplicates of yourself. You will be very busy enjoying many things. One duplicate of yourself is in the middle of doing a jigsaw puzzle   and another duplicate has almost completed another puzzle. When you become tired of the joy of puzzles, ""you"" jump to the duplicate that is eating garbage, then to the one that is playing in a rock concert, then to the one
that is scoring the winning goal. You will be so busy enjoying so many things that it could drive you crazy. 
When it is predicted that things will be better in the future, it doesn't necessarily mean that things will be easier!",high23989.txt
