2,B,"[""Minnie wasn't the type of dog the old man loved."", ""The old man couldn't see how funny Minnie looked."", 'Minnie knew very well how to make others dislike her.', ""Minnie was like the old man's dog which had just died""]",Which of the following is TRUE?,"Last summer vacation, I volunteered to work at a vet's . There I saw a lot of dogs. Minnie was the funniest-looking dog I'd ever seen. _ 
She was brought to the vet because her owners didn't want her any more. I thought Minnie had a sweet personality, though.""No one should judge her by her looks,""I thought. Finally, I advertised Minnie in the local paper.""Funny-looking dog, well-behaved, needs a loving family.""
When a boy called, I warned him that Minnie was strange-looking. The boy on the phone told me that his grandfather's sixteen-year-old dog had just died. They wanted Minnie no matter what. I gave Minnie a good bath. Then we waited for them to arrive. At last, an old car pulled up in front of the vet's. Two kids raced to the door. They picked Minnie up and rushed her out to their grandfather, who was waiting in the car. I hurried behind them to see his reaction to Minnie. Inside the car, the grandfather held Minnie in his arms and _ her soft hair. She licked his face. Her tail wagged around so quickly that it looked like it might fly off her body.
""She's perfect!""the old man said happily.
I was thankful that Minnie had found a good home.
Suddenly, I saw that the grandfather's eyes were a milky white colour--he was blind.",middle3472.txt
