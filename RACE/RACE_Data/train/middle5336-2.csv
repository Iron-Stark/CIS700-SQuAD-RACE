""Of course I know I must go,"" said the man,"" But I want to know how soon I can get to town."" ""Go,"" Aesop shouted to him again.
The man got angry. ""He must be mad,"" he thought. And he walked away. Suddenly he heard Aesop shouting to him, ""You will get to town in two hours.""The man was in great surprise. He turned back and asked, ""Why didn't you tell me that before?""
