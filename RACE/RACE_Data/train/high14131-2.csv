2,A,"['Why Workers Need Vacation', 'Why Workers Need New Energy', 'How to Deal with Daily Pressure', 'How to Spend Vacation Effectively']",Which of the following is the best title for the passage?,"Vacation is a time for refreshment. In work, we are often called to think. Sometimes, it's good to give our brains a rest. Without a break, we may not be able to perform up to our potential. This can be a problem, not only for the employee, but for the employer as well.
""The main benefit of vacation is for the worker to come back energized,"" says Weaver. ""If they haven't had a break, then they're not coming back with new energy. They haven't had a chance to step back and get perspective  , and come back with renewed enthusiasm.""
Long working hours without a break, insecurity   about one's job, and other work-related worries can lead to burnout and stress. Humans can usually adapt to pressure, but not for a limitless amount of time.
""It is a problem of relating good workers and having them loyal to the firm while they're _ ,"" says David Maume, PhD, professor of sociology at the University of Cincinnati. He says burnout can also affect employees' productivity, creativity, and effectiveness.
In addition, high levels of stress are likely to be precursors   to depression, which can hit both the employer and employee's pocketbook. Even people who manage to remain productive at work can have problems. If they're always at work, then they're not with their family and friends. If they're working while on vacation, for the time that they're on the job, they're not really present.
An unbalanced emphasis on work can strain family and social life. When you come up for air, you may see that you're alone, or that your relationships have gone on without you.",high14131.txt
