0,A,"['people can reach any floor by elevator', 'there are sofas at either end of the first floor', 'there are exhibits on the museum history', 'the Information Desk can be found on each floor']","In the Museum of Childhood,   _  .","The Museum of Childhood is spread over 4 floors, with the first floor acting like a balcony around the edge of the building, so you can look down over the ground floor central hall with the shop, Information Desk, and Benugo Cafe.
The museum of Childhood is housed in a large Victorian building in east London. It has been on this site since 1872. It has undergone refurbishment   and reopened in 2006 and an elevator now makes all floors accessible.
This is not a quiet place and children are allowed to have fun here. Child safety is extremely important and a member of staff remains by the front door at all times. Also, note the ""Code of Behavior"" notices, which include: children under 12 must be supervised by an adult; no eating in the galleries, and no running.
Toy exhibits are in glass cases and there are plenty of low-level exhibits for younger children to see. The glass cases have lots of thought-inspiring questions on them to encourage discussion between adults and children. When you or the children need some quiet time, there are sofas at either end of the second floor with reading books available.
