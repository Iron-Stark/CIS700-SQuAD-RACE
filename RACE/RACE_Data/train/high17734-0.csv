0,A,"['Traffic accidents leads to very serious economic consequences.', 'Malaria causes more deaths every year than traffic accidents.', 'Running a yellow will result in a 6-point deduction.', 'Most violators of the new traffic rules will end up in prison.']",What is true according to the passage?,"Turning left under a bridge in Beijing, Hu Xingxin, 24, suddenly braked to a stop in front of a yellow light at a busy crossroad.
""According to the new traffic regulations, running a yellow light is equal to running a red one,"" said the Beijing-based IT technician. ""Since the new rules came into effect I'm always ready to hit the brakes to avoid a penalty.""
Authorities have since changed the rules and running a yellow light no longer results in a 6-point punishment.
New traffic regulations are the latest measure to improve road safety, which has become a problem in China. Experts say that to achieve better road safety, various and comprehensive methods are needed. Updating the rules are only part of the story.
According to the WHO (World Health Organization), traffic accidents kill more people around the world than malaria and are the leading cause of death for young people aged 5 to 29 -- especially in developing countries. Each year up to 1.3 million people are killed and more than 50 million injured in traffic accidents around the world.
The economic consequences are also significant: according to a study by the World Bank and Harvard University, traffic accidents on average cost a country 1 to 3 percent of its annual Gross National Product..
The newly revised regulations impose much heavier punishment on drivers who violate traffic rules. Under the new regulations, 52 different violations result in penalties, up from 38 under the previous system.
Eleven kinds of violations now result in the deduction of 12 points, compared to six points under the previous regulation. These violations include drunken driving and using fake license plates, as well as driving without a valid license.
But traffic regulations are only one aspect of many regarding problems with road safety in China. Other components of road safety include technology and urban design.",high17734.txt
