0,B,"['For 25 years.', 'For 75 years.', 'For half a century.', 'For several months.']",How many years has the zoo been open?,"The baby elephant, Sheila, was moved out of Belfast Zoo because of fears she might be hit by bombers during the Belfast Blitz   of 1941.
She was one of the lucky ones. A lot of the animals were killed because of fears they might escape during the bombing and attack people. They included a tiger, a black bear, a wolf, a penguin, and two polar bears.
But Sheila was walked down the road by zoo-keepers to a nearby house where a woman took her in and kept her in her backyard for several months until the bombing was over.
The woman has never been identified   and the zoo knows her only as ""the elephant angel"". As the zoo celebrates its 75thbirthday, people have decided to try to find the elephant's saver. Mark Challis is the manager of Belfast Zoo. He explained a bit more about Sheila's story.
""Well, we know that Sheila, the elephant that was in the zoo at that time spent some time living with a lady relatively near to the zoo and we have one sweet photo, you can see it on our zoo website.""
""In the photo you can see the elephant with the lady in her back garden and that's almost all we know. So we're just trying to find a little bit more information and we are not even sure if the lady is alive today, but maybe her relatives or somebody will recognize the back of that house and we can fill in some detail on this story.""
Once the bombing was over, Sheila went back to the zoo and lived for another quarter of a century. She died of a skin disease in 1966.",middle4367.txt
