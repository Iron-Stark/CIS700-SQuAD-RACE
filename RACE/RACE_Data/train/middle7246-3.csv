3,C,"['There are many people in the family.', 'Everybody is busy in the family.', ""It's very nice but not his home."", ""It's a warm home for him.""]",What does Zhang Qian think of his host family?,"Today's story is about Zhang Qian,a student from Beijing. He's now studying in the United States. He's living with an American family in New York. Today is the Dragon Boat Festival. It's 9: 00 a.m. and Zhang Qian's family are at home. His mom and aunt are making zongzi. His dad and uncle are watching the boat races   on TV.
Is Zhang Qian also watching the races and eating zongzi? It's 9: 00 p. m. in New York,and it's the night before the festival. But there isn't a Dragon Boat Festival in the US, so it's like any other night for Zhang Qian and his host family . The mother is reading a story to her young children. The father is watching a football game on TV. Zhang Qian is talking on the phone to his cousin in Beijing. Zhang Qian misses his family and wants to have his mom's delicious zongzi. Zhang Qian likes New York and his host family a lot, but there's still 'no place like home'.",middle7246.txt
