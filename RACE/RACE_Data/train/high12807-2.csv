2,C,"['a housewife and a new mom', 'an athlete and a career woman', 'a parent and a sportswoman', 'a wife and a good mother']","In most days of 2011, Armstrong could be described as   _  .","For every woman who feels like she's had to scale back her personal ambitions since becoming a mother, gold medal cyclist Kristin Armstrong has a message: Don't give up on your dreams.
She retired after winning gold in Beijing to start a family; son Lucas arrived in 2010, but then she decided to compete again in the London Olympics. She won a gold medal at last.
The decision to start training again wasn't easy. ""I struggled with that a lot,"" she told a newspaper. ""At the beginning I felt selfish, I felt like, 'Well, I'm not supposed to be thinking of myself anymore. It's all supposed to be for my kid.'""
She faced physical challenges of getting back into competition shape after giving birth, as well. When she started racing in the spring of 2011, she was still breast-feeding; she would nurse her son, then race, then breast-feed again after the race. Her days revolved around Lucas and training.
""I feel like I'm able to do what I love to do and still manage a family and have that balance,"" Armstrong said. ""That you have a family or a child doesn't mean that you have to stop going after what you dream of individually.""
Armstrong makes balance look easy, whether it's on her bike or as an athlete-mom. But she points out that you can't have it all without making some sacrifices. For example, don't expect a neat home--her husband, Joe Savola, who she describes as her support system and her ""protector"", says he's had to give up on trying to keep everything orderly at home and just accept that their living room has become Lucas's playroom. For Armstrong, she's sacrificed time with friends who had kids around the same age--there just wasn't time.
Now, she says, ""That sounds like fun to me."" As she heads home to Boise, Idaho, she's ready to do regular mom stuff.",high12807.txt
