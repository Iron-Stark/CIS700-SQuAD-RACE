THIS summer, many Beijing middle school students had a different kind of vacation. Instead of hanging out with friends or traveling, they were training hard for the National Day celebration.
To mark the special anniversary  of China this year, the students performed a group dance in a big parade on Tian'anmen Square on October 1.
Students were training from 7:30am to around 10:00am or from 4 pm to 6:30pm. It was to avoid the summer heat.
They wore white hats, T-shirts and dark-blue trousers. The hats and T-shirts were printed with a red logo, the number '60"".
The first week of training was PE. Students practiced standing and squatting .  Then they moved on to practice the group display. The use colored sheets in the shape of flowers as a prop . When we watch the parade on TV we will see them making colorful patterns with them.
What do the students think of their unusual summer?
""Sometimes we find it a bit tiring."" says Lu Wenqi,13.""But most of us think it's a great honor to take part in such an important celebration.""
Li Hui, 15, thinks the same as Lu. She says her classmates are seldom late for training.
""It's a wonderful chance for us,' says Li. ""When my parents were in college, they also took part in a national day celebration. Now it's my turn!""
