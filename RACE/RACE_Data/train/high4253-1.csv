1,D,"['glory', 'wealth', 'pleasure', 'work']",High performers is that they tend to give priority to   _  .,"Fourteen - year - old Richie Hawley had spent five years studying violin at the Community School of Performing Arts in Los Angeles when he took part in a violin contest. Ninety two young people were invited to the contest and Hawley came out first.
The contest could have been the perfect setup for fear, worrying about mistakes, and trying to impress the judges.But Hawley says he did pretty well in staying calm. ""I couldn't be thinking about how many mistakes I'd make--it would distract me from playing,"" he says.""I didn't even remember trying to impress people while I played. It's almost as if they weren't there. I just wanted to make music.""
Hawley is a winner. But he didn't become a winner by concentrating on winning. He did it by concentrating on playing well.
""The important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part,"" said the founder of the modern Olympics, Pierre de Coubertin.""The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle.The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.""
A characteristic of high performers is their intense, pleasurable concentration on work, rather than on their competitors or future glory or money, says Dr.Charles Garfield, who has studied 1,500 achievers in business, science, sports, the arts, and professions.""They are interested in winning, but they're most interested in self-development, testing their limits.""
One of the most surprising things about top performers is how many losses they've had and how much they've learned from each. ""Not one of the 1,500 I studied defined losing as failing,"" Garfield says.""They kept calling their losses 'setbacks'.""
A healthy attitude toward setbacks is essential to winning, experts agree.
""The worst thing you can do if you've had a setback is to let yourself get stuck in a prolonged depression. You should analyze carefully what went wrong, identify specific things you did right and give yourself credit for them."" Garfield believes that most people don't give themselves enough praise. He even suggests keeping a diary of all the positive things you've done on the way to a goal.",high4253.txt
