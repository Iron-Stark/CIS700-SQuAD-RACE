Officer: Good evening, sir. We're testing drivers for drunk driving. Would you please blow into this machine?
Man: I'm sorry, I can't do that. If I blow into that machine, I will get out of air.
Officer: Please come along to the office and we can give you a blood test.
Man: I can't do that. If you give me a blood test, I will bleed to death.
Officer: Then you'll have to get out and walk five metres along this white line.
Man: I can't do that, either.
Officer: Why not?
Man: Because I'm dead drunk! I can't open the door.",middle142.txt
