1,C,"['they cannot buy the clothes they see in magazines', 'their husbands or boyfriends want them to do so', 'ready-to-wear clothes cost a great deal of money', ""they can't get great satisfaction from buying clothes""]",American women make clothes by themselves because  _  .,"As we all know sewing-machine  repair is one of the fastest growing businesses in the world today. Newspapers, women's magazines, high schools and colleges are all encouraging millions of American women to do their own sewing, not only to make their own shirts and sweaters, but also to make nice clothes for their husbands, sons, or boyfriends. The lattes figures  show that over 89 million American women, because of the high costs of ready-to-wear clothing are now making almost all of their families' clothes. Most of these women get great satisfaction from making the family clothes on their own sewing machines. So it is natural that the demand  for excellent service of sewing machines is growing.
Think of it! 89 million or more sewing machines, not including another 10 million sewing machines in schools of all kinds, need service at least once a year, and quite possibly four or more times each year. I know some women who return their sewing machines to repairmen time after time to get them fixed properly. I've seen sewing machines come out of repair shops in worse condition than they were when they went in.
So I've decided to write an introduction book to sewing-machine repair and teach people how to repair their own sewing machines at home. It's not that difficult. In the book, I will teach you everything you need to know about how to repair your sewing machine.",high11475.txt
