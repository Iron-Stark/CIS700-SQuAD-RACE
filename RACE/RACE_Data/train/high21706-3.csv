3,D,"['we should love and respect the animals', 'we should live with the animals peacefully in this world', 'the animals are also lovely and friendly', 'the animals are usually more clever than the human beings']",We can't learn from the passage that  _  .,"Kewen Lichadson is thirty two years old now. He works in the Lasailian Park in the South Africa, where many wild animals such as lions, tigers, leopards and wolves are living. When you get there you may have a chance to see him playing with these wild animals without anything to protect himself except a small bag of pepper . Sometimes he would go swimming with them side by side.
It is reported that nearly all the wild animals are brought up by him even from the time they were six months old. For so many years he has cared for them day and night that they have made great friendship between them. ""Sometimes if I could not get home at night I would stay with these animals throughout the night. It's quite warm and safe."" He often says to the reporter.
""Compared with animals, the human beings are less trusted."" he may go on. ""You needn't have to worry about whether these wild animals could make a secret attack from the back, but for the human beings I can't give you a good answer because, I believe, they are more cunning ."" 
When asked why, he would tell you, ""I'm not a talented animal tamer, you know. But I believe, like any of us they have their own feelings. Instead of sticks, whips  or iron chains , I treat them with as much patience and respect as possible. Perhaps this might be dangerous but for me this is not a kind of job but love.""",high21706.txt
