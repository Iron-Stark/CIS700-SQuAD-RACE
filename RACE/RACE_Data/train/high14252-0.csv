0,C,"['Independent and knowledgeable.', 'Stubborn and trustworthy.', 'Courageous and persistent.', 'Aggressive and sympathetic.']",Which of the following adjectives can best describe Malala according to this passage?,"On July 12, 1997, Malala Yousafzai was born in Mingora, Pakistan, located in the country's Swat Valley.
Yotsafzai attended a school that her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, had founded. After the Taliban began attacking girl schools in Swat, Malala gave a speech in Peshawar, Pakistan, in September 2008. The title of her talk was, ""How dare the Taliban take away my basic right to education?""
When she was 14, Malala and her family learned that the Taliban had issued a death threat against her. Though Malala was frightened for the safety of her father----an anti-Taliban activist-she and her family initially felt that the fundamentalist group would not actually harm a child.
On October 9, 2012, on her way home from school, a man boarded the bus Malala was riding in and demanded to know which girl was Malala. When her friends looked toward Malala, her location was given away. The gunman fired at her, hitting Malala in the left side of her head. Two other girls were also injured in the attack.
Despite the Taliban's threats, Yousafzai remains a firm advocate for the power of education. On October 10, 2013, in acknowledgement of her work, the European Parliament awarded Yousafzai the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. That same year, she was nominated   for a Nobel Peace Prize. She didn't win the prize, but was named a nominee again in March 2014.
Malala Yousafzai's Speech at the United Nations (Excerpt)
Dear brothers and sisters, do remember one thing. Malala Day is not my day. Today is the day of every woman, every boy and every girl who have raised their voice for their rights. There are hundreds of human rights activists and social workers who are not only speaking for human rights, but who are struggling to achieve their goals of education, peace and equality.Thousands of people have been killed by the terrorists and millions have been injured.I am just one of them.
...
Dear sisters and brothers, now it's time to speak up.
So today, we call upon the world leaders to change their strategic policies in favour of peace and prosperity:
We call upon the world leaders that all the peace deals must protect women and children's rights.
We call upon all governments to ensure free compulsory education for every child all over the world.
We call upon all governments to fight against terrorism and violence, to protect children from brutality and harm.
We call upon the developed nations to support the expansion of educational opportunities for girls in the developing world.
We call upon our sisters around the world to be brave--to embrace   the strength within themselves and realise their full potential.",high14252.txt
