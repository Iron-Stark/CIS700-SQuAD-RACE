But only some people remember their dreams. Our dreams often include all the senses--smells, sounds, sights, tastes and things we touch.
Early in the twentieth century, two famous scientists developed their personal ideas about dreams. Austrian psychiatrist  Sigmund Freud believed people often dream about things they want but can't have. Swiss  psychiatrist Carl Jung worked closely with Freud for several years, but he believed dreams provide solutions to problems we face when we are awake.

He says that when we dream, the brain is trying to make sense of the world. He does not agree with Sigmund Freud that dreaming is the way we express our hidden feelings and desires .
