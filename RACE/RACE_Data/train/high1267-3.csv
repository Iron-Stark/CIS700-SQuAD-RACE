3,D,"['Because he was certainly the best barber.', 'Because he was free all the time.', 'Because he was the worst barber.', ""Because he wasn't the worst barber.""]",Bob told Jack to find out which barber's hair looked the worst and then go straight to him. Why?,"Jack went to a barber's shop and had his hair cut, but when he came out, he was not happy with the result . When his friend Bob saw him, he laughed and said, ""What has happened to your hair, Jack?""
Jack said, ""I tried a new barber's shop today, because I wasn't quite satisfied with my old one, but this one seems even worse.""
Bob agreed . ""Yes, I think you're right, Jack. Now I'll tell you what to do when you go into a barber's shop next time: look at all the barber's hair, find out whose hair looks worst, and then go straight to him.""
""Why shall I go to him?"" Jack asked. ""But that would be foolish!""
""Oh, no, it wouldn't,"" answered Bob. ""Who cut that man's hair? Just think it. He couldn't cut it himself, could he? Another of the barbers cut it. So you know he can't be the worst barber.""",high1267.txt
