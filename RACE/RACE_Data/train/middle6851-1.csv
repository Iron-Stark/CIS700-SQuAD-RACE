From today's newspaper, I know that in 2014 you might get a Morning After Robot. It will clean your house after a party. The Robot can take picture of your room before the party. After the party, the robot will go around the room, and it will pick up bottles and trash. After that it will compare the room with the picture and put things back according to its original shape. Such robots are being studied in a lab at Stanford University. That sounds pretty cool! If we can see the robot and have enough money, we must buy them.
Robot Roomba
Mothers' Day is coming. You can give Robot Roomba as a gift to your mother. The Roomba is a great gift for two reasons. On the one hand, it's really cool as a useful robot. It can actually clean your floor. Maybe not as fast or well as a person does, but it is a lot more fun cleaning the floor by the Roomba than cleaning the floor yourself. On the other hand, it shows the family life is very modern.",middle6851.txt
