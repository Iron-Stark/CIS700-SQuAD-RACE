0,B,"['His conscience of being a citizen.', 'Reports about sending soldiers to Afghanistan.', 'His relatives being killed in the war.', 'Getting no reasonable explanation.']",What caused the author to write the letter?,"Dear Editor,
Recent reports have indicated an additional 1, 400 Marines are being sent to Afghanistan in the coming weeks. This means it costs over $1 million annually on the ground over there. I do place a higher level of blame on the policymakers who send soldiers off to kill and be killed in the field. I think the human race needs to think more about killing.
One needs to do the _ : ""Are these wars JUST?"" I believe that all of our wars since 1945 have been illegal, under international law as well. I suggest that all your readers examine their conscience as it relates to the matter of making war. The fact that many soldiers are motivated by a strong sense of duty does not give them some unqualified moral right to support these wars or any other. It's responsible for all the troops, and the entire population, to determine whether the Afghan or Iraq wars are in accordance with  the development of the state.
I wish someone would give me one or more logical reasons why we are still fighting in Afghanistan and what our goals are. I certainly don't understand it and neither do many who are more knowledgeable than I.
Outsiders have tried unsuccessfully for centuries to conquer Afghanistan, and we seem to be no more successful. We are trying to develop a stable central government, but the country is badly divided into ethnic and tribal groups, and the current government is corrupt . Moreover, we are apparently regarded as undesirable occupiers by many of its people, most notably the Taliban. 
If we are to continue spending billions every year in Afghanistan and killing hundreds of our people and many of theirs, our government must provide us with a reasonable explanation of why we are doing so and what we can expect to accomplish.
