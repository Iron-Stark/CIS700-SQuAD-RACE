1,A,"['He was impatient and wanted to go home.', 'He wanted to see whether the woman had money or not.', 'He wanted the woman to stand in another line.', ""He didn't think about the customers waiting behind the woman.""]",Which of the following statements is TRUE about Jeffrey Kandt when the woman couldn't find her money?,"The Wal-Mart in Cleburne, Texas, was crowded.

The woman standing in cashier Jeffrey Kandt's line seemed to be living on the edge of subsistence . Her clothes were worn and her hands were those of a person who'd worked hard for what she had. She held a single item in her arms as she patiently waited to move to the front of the line -- a Sony CD player. She had saved all year for this. With tax, the total would be close to $ 220.
As the woman got close to the cashier, she suddenly shouted, ""Where's my money? All of my money fro my son's gift! Oh no!""
""Why my line?"" Kandt thought as he watched the poor woman searching through her clothes. He was going to have to call his manager to avoid the sale but it would mean a long wait for the customers behind her. ""I am going to go home late tonight,"" Kandt thought.
Then an amazing thing happened. At the back of the line, a man took out his wallet, pulled out $100 and passed it forward. As the cash moved up the line, a twen5ty-dollar bill was added here, and a ten-dollar bill was added there. When the collection finally reached the registewr, Kandt counted $ 220.
