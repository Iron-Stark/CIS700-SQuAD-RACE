0,B,"['Paul received an expensive car', 'Paul told him about the car', 'he saw the shining car', 'he was walking around the car']",The street urchin was very surprised when   _  .,"A friend of mine named Paul received an expensive car from his brother as a Christmas present.On Christmas Eve when Paul came out of his office,a street urchin was walking around the shining car.""Is this your car,Paul?""he asked. 
Paul answered,""Yes,my brother gave it to me for Christmas."" The boy was surprised.""You mean your brother gave it to you and it didn't cost you nothing?Boy,I wish..."" He hesitated.
Of course Paul knew what he was going to wish for.He was going to wish he had a brother like that. But what the boy said surprised Paul greatly.
""I wish,"" the boy went on,""that I could be a brother like that."" Paul looked at the boy in surprise, then he said again, ""Would you like to take a ride in my car?""
""Oh yes,I'd love that.""
After a short ride,the boy turned and with his eyes shining,said,""Paul,would you mind driving in front of my house?""
Paul smiled a little.He thought he knew what the boy wanted.He wanted to show his neighbours that he could ride home in a big car. But Paul was wrong again. ""Will you stop where those two steps are?"" the boy asked.
He ran up to the steps. Then in a short while Paul heard him coming back, but he was not coming fast. He was carrying his little crippled brother. He sat him down on the step and pointed to the car.
""There she is, Buddy, just like I told you upstairs. His brother gave it to him for Christmas and it didn't cost him a cent. And some day I'm going to give you one just like it...then you can see for yourself all the nice things in the Christmas windows that I've been trying to tell you about.""
Paul got out and lifted the boy to the front seat of his car. The shining-eyed older brother climbed in beside him and the three of them began an unforgettable holiday ride.
