She asked the salesgirl to let her have a look at a new dress on display, but the girl stood still behind the counter, taking no notice of the request.
The old woman spoke to the girl again, raising her voice a bit, but still received no answer. The old woman looked closely at the girl and nodded to her, ""I am too old to see well."" I can't even tell a plastic   model from a real girl.""
On hearing this, the salesgirl shouted at the old woman, "" What? Did you call me a plastic model?""
The old woman was greatly surprised. ""On, dear me,"" she said. ""The model can speak. Then it must be a robot of a new type.""",middle1216.txt
