2,D,"['He goes out with friends', 'He does his homework in his bedroom.', 'He closes the door and calls his friends.', 'He turns on the computer and plays with it']",What does her son always do as soon as he gets home?,"Dear Abby,
I am a helpless mother, my son is 15 years old. I find out that the older he grows, the less we talk. I feel very worried and I really need help.
My first problem is about his hobbies, he seems to spend too much time on computer games. As soon as he gets home, he always turns on the computer, closes the door and locks others out. I am getting worried about him, especially when his English teacher told me he always fails(,) in the English exam.
Secondly, it seems that he is crazy  about the new technology. However, to be honest, I don't have enough money and I can't _ all the things he wants.
Recently, I have found that he seems to be always alone. I have never seen him talking to his friends on the phone or going out with anyone on weekends. That is the last problem I have.
Do all the boys behave this way? What should I do to help him?
