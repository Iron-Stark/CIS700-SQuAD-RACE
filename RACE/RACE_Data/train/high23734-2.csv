2,B,"['Youth is a wonderful thing.', 'We youth should face challenge with smile.', 'Entrance examination is very important in our life.', ""The entrance examination isn't so terrible.""]",What kind of belief does the film convey?,"What does the word""youth"" mean to you? Many define it as a precious time in their life when they are young ,when fun ,passion,and imagination seem limitless.But for most high school students,youth is a time of determination and willpower for achieving their goals.
This is vividly shown in Mark of Youth,a movie that opened on Feb 5.Mark of Uouth tells the story of four Senior 3 students in a top high school in the days leading up to the national cooege entrance examination.
Each character represents a differet type of student,ranging from the most mischievous to the most motvated .Like most teenagers ,they enjoy carefree moments and like to talk about their schoolmates.But the rension of the approaching exam,probably their first life-changing event,is common-they must memorize seemingly endless English words and Chinese poems,work through piles of aractice test papers,and improve their scores despite the increasing pressure.
But life exists beyond campus.That the college entrance examination is coming up doesn't mean they can escape family changes,such as when one character's parents get divorced or another's father is arrested.Can these four young people handle their problems and eventually make it to their ideal universities despite their on -and -off campus stress?
The story is set in Hubei Huanggang Middle School,known for its students'outstanding performances on the big exam.The four students are played by the actors who played in the reality shows Happy Boys and Happy Girls.HongKong actor Alex Fong plays their teacher.
