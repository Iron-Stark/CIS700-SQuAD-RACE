He told the local newspaper the US traditional way of adding ""Junior"" or ""II"" after a boy's name was too common. So, when his son was born last week, he decided on the name John Blake 2.0, as if he were a software programmer.
Mr. Blake admitted that it took months to persuade his wife, Jamie, to accept the idea. Mrs. Blake said she asked several friends whether they could accept this name or not. ""All the men,"" she said, ""felt the name was cool."" However,her women friends did not think so. ""I think the women end up like it,""she said.
Mr. Blake told the local newspaper he got the idea from a film called The Legend of 1900,in which an abandoned baby is given the name 1900 to remember the year of its birth. ""I thought that if they can do it , why can't we?"" he said. After little John version 2.0 was born, Mr. Blake even sent a celebratory e-mail to the family and friends, which was designed to look as if he and his wife had created a new software. ""I wrote things like there are a lot of new features from Version 1.0 with additional features from Jamie,"" he said. And he has already planned for his son's future. ""If he has a child, he could name it 3.0,"" he said.",high14755.txt
