3,C,"['Having brothers and sisters is fun', ""it's tiring to look after three children"", ""every kid needs parents' full attention"", ""parents should watch others' kids""]",The author seems to believe that   _  .,"Our ""Mommy and Me"" time began two years ago.
   My next-door neighbor and fellow mother, Christie, and I were our in our front yards, watching seven children of age six and under ride their bikes up and down. ""I wish I could take one of my children out alone,"" said Christie. Then we worked out a plan. When Christie takes one of her children out alone, I'll watch her other three. And when she watched two of mine, I will take someone out.
   The children were extremely quick to accept the idea of ""Mommy and Me"" time. Christie's daughter, McKenzie, went first. When she returned, the other children showered her with tons of questions. McKenzie was smiling broadly. Christie looked refreshed and happy. ""She is like a different kid when there's no one else around,"" Christie shared with me quietly. With her mother all to herself, McKenzie didn't have to make any effort to gain attention.
   Just as Christie had noticed changes in McKenzie, I also discovered something different in each of my children during our alone times. For example, I'm always surprised when my daughter, who is seldom close to me, holds my hand frequently. My stuttering  son, Tom, doesn't stutter once during our activities since he doesn't have to struggle for a chance to speak. And the other son, Sam, who is always a follower when around other children, shines a leader during our times together.
   The ""Mommy and Me"" time allows us to be simply alone and away with each child--talking, sharing and laughing, which has been the biggest gain. Every child deserves an only child at least once in a while.",high22945.txt
