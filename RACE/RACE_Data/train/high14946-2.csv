2,C,"['People should pay for Internet news.', 'Newspaper news will soon disappear.', 'Internet news is given to readers in good time.', 'It is wrong to say no to newspaper news.']",Which of the following may Amanda agree with?,"It was a long week for Amanda at school. She stayed after school to work on a special project  three days in a row. When she got home on Friday, she dropped into the chair with a sigh.
""What's going on, Amanda?"" her dad asked as he was reading the newspaper.
""I have to create a webpage for my technology class, and it is taking a lot more time than I thought it would,"" Amanda answered.
Her dad looked over his newspaper and asked Amanda what the webpage was about.
""It's about the difference between newspaper news and Internet news,"" Amanda said and added, ""I have to provide information, examples and illustrations .""
""Sounds tough; do you have someone to help you?"" her dad asked.
""I have a partner named Zach,"" Amanda replied. ""We did research on the Internet today and found some pictures to use.""
Then Amanda explained to her father the main differences: newspaper news is printed on paper, and Internet news is published online; newspaper news is only available once a day, and Internet news is published almost as soon as the news happens; many newspapers don't even print a daily paper, and Internet news is published around the clock.
Amanda's dad asked, ""Which type of news do you like better?""
""I like Internet news better because I like to learn about the news when it happens,"" she answered.
Her dad said, ""I still like newspaper news better because I like to hold the paper in my hands and turn the pages.""
Amanda dropped into her chair again and said, ""You are so old school, Dad.""",high14946.txt
