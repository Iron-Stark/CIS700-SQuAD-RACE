0,A,"['Unhappy.', 'Helpless.', 'Useless.', 'Meaningless.']",What does the writer think of their senior high school life?,"It was about six years ago.We were at senior high school.Those days in school were gray to most Chinese students because of the college entrance examination pressure.Not our parents and teachers didn't love us,but they loved us too much.Our only happiness was a high grade in the exam.
One afternoon after the final exam,we four girls came to a small wood and we felt _ only belonging to us that afternoon.We talked and laughed.We played all the games that we could think of.We felt we were on the top of the world for the first time in our life.We totally forgot the unhappiness in our life and we threw the homework and the endless exams far away out of the wood.
In the middle of the wood ran a small and peaceful stream.Now and then,we could see some wild ducks on the water looking for food.The water weeds danced happily while the water passed beside them.The air was so fresh that we breathed it freely.
The sun had set before we knew it.We had to leave the place which brought us much happiness.We agreed to come back again every time we felt bored.
Years later,we went there several times.But,every time we went there to find that great feeling,we failed.Strangely,the feeling was different from that of several years ago.
I know that wonderful experience was just for once.We can never find that kind of happiness again which only belonged to the special afternoon in our life.That was a release of our uneasy heart.We can never go back to that young age or that simple life.It was our golden ages.No matter how boring and hard the life was,it gave us something worthy to recall.We'll treasure it forever.",high6982.txt
