This special water spider lives on the grassy banks of streams where mosquitoes, damsel flies and other insects come to feed and breed.
Although it is one of the largest spiders in prefix = st1 /New Zealand, it has an unusual ability. It doesn't disturb the water as it waits for its meal, and there is barely a ripple  when it skims  across the surface at lightning speed to catch its prey.
Grass water spiders deal swiftly with larger insects like damsel flies by pulling their heads under the water and holding them there until they drown.
After a meal, the grass water spider spends up to half an hour grooming  itself. It wipes its eight eyes, brushes its antennae , and takes special care to clean the hairs on its body.
