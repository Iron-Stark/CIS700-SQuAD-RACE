3,C,"['A personal computer needs 300 years to finish the work that a supercomputer does in a day.', 'Japan now leads the world in the area of supercomputers.', 'Supercomputer can be used by food companies.', ""Scientists needn't use software to turn small companies into one supercomputer.""]",Which of the following is true?,"Did you hear of the supercomputer? Recently, China's Tianhe-1   was ranked as the world's fastest supercomputer, according to a new list of world's TOP 500 supercomputers.
It took 200 Chinese scientists two years to build the fastest supercomputer. It can do 2,507 trillion   calculations in a second! That means it will take a personal computer 600 years to finish the work that a supercomputer does in a day!
The US now leads the world in the area of supercomputers. It is home to more than half of the world's top 500 supercomputers. Japan also has advanced technology. China is developing its supercomputer technology quickly. But experts say it will take years before China's total computing power can catch up with that of the US.
Supercomputers can work on many different things. They can solve problems in areas like national defense  , energy and science. In business, you can also use supercomputers. Oil companies use them to find oil and gas. Banks use them for quick trades. Food companies even use supercomputers to make sure that they put potato chips into cans without breaking them.
To make a supercomputer, scientists first need to link   thousands of small computers together. Then they use software to turn them into one supercomputer. In fact, any person with enough knowledge about computers can make a supercomputer. But you need the top technology to make a supercomputer run fast.",middle4346.txt
