3,D,"['She fell on the ground.', 'She felt sad.', 'Only the writer helped her.', 'The other students caught her.']",What happened to the girl in the end?,"Will you trust your friends if you can't see anything? If you are falling, do you believe they will catch you and help you stand up? Our teacher helped us to get the answer.
One day, Mr. Morrie came into the classroom and said he had a game for us to try. He divided us into two groups. One student from the first group, stood in front of us with his eyes closed, and then fell backwards . The second group stood behind him. Before he fell on the floor, they should catch him and not let him get hurt. Most of us were uncomfortable with this. We were afraid that they wouldn't catch us and we would hit the floor. So we didn't move. We just stood there and laughed in embarrassment.
Finally, one student, a thin, quiet, dark-haired girl called Sarah, decided to move. She crossed her arms in front of her body, closed her eyes, and slowly fell backwards. She looked quiet but brave.
For a moment, I was sure that she was going to fall on the floor. But before she hit the floor, the other students caught her, held her and finally helped her stand up.
""Whoa!!"" We were all surprised, and also encouraged . The girl was happy, too. Seeing this, Morrie smiled and said to the girl, ""When you close your eyes, you can't see anything. You won't feel safe. When you are falling, the feeling gets stronger. You are not sure whether you will hit the cold, hard floor or the warm, soft hands of your friends. But if you are brave enough to trust them, they will not let you down .""",middle3081.txt
