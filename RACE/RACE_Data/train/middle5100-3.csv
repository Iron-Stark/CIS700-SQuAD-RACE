3,A,"['The City Mouse and the Country Mouse', 'Two friends', 'Two Beautiful Mice', 'The Country and they City']",Which is the best title?,"There are two mice. They are called Bill and Paul. They are good friends. One mouse lives in the country; the other mouse lives in the city. On a sunny day they meet in the street.
Paul: Hi, Bill! Have a look at my house in the country. I'm sure you can enjoy yourself.
Bill: I'd love to. But I hear that the food is not delicious, and your house is not good. Is it so?
Paul: No, that's not true. Go and see!
Then Bill goes to the countryside with Paul.
Bill: Why do you live in a hole in the field? You should come and live in the city. You would live in a nice house made of stone. You would have better food to eat. You must come and see me at my house in the city.
Paul: Thanks! Maybe you are right. I'll visit your house one day.
 _ days later Paul goes to Bill's house in the city. The house is big and beautiful. They are sitting in the sitting-room, having a big dinner comfortably. Suddenly, there a great noise.
Bill: Run! Run! The cat is coming!
Paul: Oh, no! It's terrible! Both the house and the food are nice, but I do not like living in the city. I enjoy living in my hole in the field, for it is nice to be poor but happy than to be rich but afraid.",middle5100.txt
