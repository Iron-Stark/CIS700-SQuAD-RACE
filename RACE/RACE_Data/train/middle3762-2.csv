2,D,"['Generous', 'Polite', 'Clever', 'Foolish']",What's the meaning of  _  here?,"I think lots of students like the pop singer named Jay. I also like him very much.
Do you know as a boy, Jay was called _ . But his mother noticed that the quiet, shy boy seemed to dance well when he heard the Western pop music. His mother sent him to a piano school when he was four. When he grows up, he has an ability for playing the piano beyond  his years. I learned to play the piano from 7 years old to 13 years old. I often feel bored when I practice playing the piano. But Jay was always crazy about playing the piano. I think he really likes music. He is my hero..
I admire  Jay. The real reason is when the others all denied  him, he never gave up. He tried his best to change his life. I think it is good for everybody. I hope that everyone can learn from him--try our best to do everything. Then I think we will be the winners.",middle3762.txt
