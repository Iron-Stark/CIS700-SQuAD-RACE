2,A,"['She was not very wealthy actually.', ""She had met the lady's mum."", 'She considered her dress beautiful.', 'She was living on charity.']",What can we infer about the author?,"I am usually in a bad mood after a long day at work, but on this particular Friday afternoon I was in a cheerful mood.I planned to have a good meal and watch Bridget Jones's Diary.
My local supermarket is always busy.The first parking space I spotted was convenient, but I'd noticed a woman in an old car circling for a while.I let her have it.On the edge of the car park I backed into the next available spot--it was a tight fit.
In record time I'd made my way through the supermarket and was back in the fresh air.In such a rush of good spirits, I emptied my purse change into the hands of a homeless man and helped a struggling woman go backwards into a parking space.
Just as I spotted my car, 1 saw the woman I'd let have my car space earlier.I smiled and wished her a pleasant day.
As I got back into my car, I spotted the same lady looking ill at me.""Hello,"" she said, hesitantly.""This might sound crazy but I was on my way to drop some of my mother's things off at tile charity bins."" I looked quickly at the orange bins in the corner of the parking lot, confused.""I saw you helping those people, and you seemed so happy.My mom had a dress just like that.""
She looked at me meaningfully.I smiled at her in encouragement, hoping she wouldn't notice that the dress she was admiring was now full of holes.""I was going to give these away, but you are just so much like her."" She passed a box in through the window.Shocked, unthinking, 1 took it automatically.""I think she would like you to have it."" She smiled and walked away.
After a pause, I opened the box.Inside was a beautiful gold necklace.It was the nicest gift I'd  ever received, and it was from a complete stranger.
Later, I thought back on the day.I didn't feel the usual sense of exhaustion.The necklace was around my neck, a warm reminder of human kindness.",high18724.txt
