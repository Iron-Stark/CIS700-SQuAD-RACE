Friends often affect   our health and energy. More and more people are turning towards their friends for support  and sharing. We may have a very unclear understanding of what makes a friend but we all want to have many good friends around us. There are certain steps that can win you friends or at least help you get close to those whom you want to make friends with.
The first step to make friends with someone is to make him like you. If they don't like you in the beginning, it is impossible for them to become your friends. To let someone know that you're interested in him, a little smile and calling him by his name can help. To make the other person feel important, you need to be a good listener and encourage  the other person to talk. Give your honest and real opinions but do not make fun of him or her.
The second step is to fully understand each other. You need to share his or her opinions. So, it is necessary for you to develop a habit of seeing things from the other person's point of view .
The third and final step is to show your support and encouragement towards your friend.",high22817.txt
