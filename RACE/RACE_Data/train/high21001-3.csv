3,C,"['Digital technology goes into the kitchen', 'Enjoying cooking in the newest kitchen', 'Talking kitchen helps your French', 'A new way of learning cultures']",What would be the best title for the passage?,"A ""talking kitchen"" teaches students how to cook French dishes and speak French. Researchers at New Castle University have developed the French Digital Kitchen. Professors Paul Seedhouse and Patrick Olivier led the project. Professor Seedhouse says that it works like a satellite navigation system   in a car.
The kitchen equipment and tools use motion sensor  technology similar to the Nintendo Wii game system. The sensors help a computer guide the students through instructions in French. The system can tell whether you've done what you were asked to do or not. For example, the system tells you to take some butter and cut it with a knife. There's a sensor on the package containing the butter so it can tell where the butter's being moved. The sensor in the knife not only knows that the knife is moving, but it also knows what motion the knife is making. So it can tell whether the knife is being used. And so it doesn't go on to the next stage of the program unless you've done what it tells you to do. Students can ask the computer to repeat the instructions or translate them into English. There are vocabulary lessons before and after the cooking.
Professor Seedhouse became interested in the idea after he visited a talking kitchen designed for a different purpose. ""It was actually for communicating with people who suffer from dementia  "" .And so, for example, it can speak to those people and tell them that they've left the cooker on and they should turn it off.""",high21001.txt
