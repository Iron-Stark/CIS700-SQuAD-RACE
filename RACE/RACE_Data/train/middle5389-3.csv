3,A,"[""His father's love."", ""His mother's love."", 'His own hard-work.', ""His parent's hard-work.""]",Where did Emie's kindness and caring come from?,"As a young man, Tom was a famous artist with a wife and two fine sons. One night, his older son was ill. Tom and his wife thought it was nothing serious. But the boy died suddenly that night..
After his son died, Tom always felt very sad. To make matters worse, his wife also left him later, leaving him alone with his six-year-old younger son, Emie. Sadly, he turned to alcohol  for help.
As time went by, Tom began to lose everything he had---his land, house, etc. A few months later, Tom passed away alone in a small bar. Hearing of Tom's death, I thought,""What a complete failure!""
But later, I began to change my earlier opinion. I knew Tom's now adult son, Emie. He is one of the kindest, most caring men. I saw the love between Emie and his children. And I thought that kindness and caring had to come from somewhere.
One day, I asked him what made him become such a specia1 person. Emie said quietly, ""My father came into my room every night, give me a kiss and said,""love you, son.""
Hearing his words, I understood everything. Tom didn't leave many things behind. But he had been a kind loving father, and left behind his best love.",middle5389.txt
