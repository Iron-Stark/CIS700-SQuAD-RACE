1,A,"['The earth--our mother.', 'Defenders of the Earth  .', 'The earth is very beautiful and healthy.', 'The water on the earth is very clean.']",What is the best title of the passage?,"People often say that the earth is like our mother. She gives life to all the living things on the earth and provides us with air, food, water and other essential things we need for living.
Once she was beautiful and rich, but now she becomes dirtier and dirtier, poorer and poorer. It is due to what we have done to her. Please have a good look at her: polluted rivers and lakes, growing deserts, the destruction of the forests and wild life, and the depletion (,) of the ozone layer  ...
Can she bear to see her children putting the waste here and there? Can she bear to see her children cutting down the trees and destroying the grassland, to see the acid rain destroying everything? Can we bear to see our mother suffering   so much? Isn't it time for us to ask ourselves whether this is the way to treat our mother?
Floods, droughts, acid rain..., these are the punishments   from nature. Everyone should know that there is only one earth. If we go on treating her like this, it won't be fit for us to live in any longer. It's time for us to love her, take good care of her and cure her. We should save the earth so as to save ourselves.",middle19.txt
