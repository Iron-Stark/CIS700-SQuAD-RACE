1,B,"['They think it is easy to maintain.', 'They think it needs too much action and focus.', 'They think it is impossible to establish the habit of success.', ""They think it doesn't require too much work.""]",What do many people wrongly think of success?,"Michael Jordon is the greatest basketball player of all time. Once he was making a television commercial  . All Michael needed to do in the advertisement was to miss a shot.
For Michael, this was difficult. He had conditioned himself to succeed whenever he was throwing the ball. Every time he threw a basketball, it went in. Every time he tried to miss a shot, he failed. In total, it took him over 20 attempts   before he missed a shot.
For Michael, success is a strong habit. He had formed a habit that was so strong that it took him a lot of time to break it and ""fail"".
Just like drinking, smoking and collecting things, success is also a habit. The only thing is, it is much more effective!
Like all habits, once it is established  , it is difficult to break.
Many people think that success is difficult to maintain  . They feel that it will be hard work and will need too much action and focus. The truth is that it is simply a habit, and as easy to maintain as any other habit.
Spend some time making success a habit in your life. Once you have developed it, it is not something you will want to change again. Then, the only thing you will fail at is failing.",high14134.txt
