2,D,"['Because the teachers are the best.', 'Because the boys work very hard.', 'Because the students are very nice to the students.', 'Because the students work very hard and the teachers are very nice.']",Why is Amy's class the best class in Grade 7?,"Hi, my name is Amy. I am a Grade 7 student, and I would like to tell you something about my class and myself.
There are ten classes in Grade 7.In each class, there are about forty students. I think that my class, Class 4 is the best .That is because all the students in my class work very hard and the teachers are all very nice to the students. But I am not one of the best students in the class.
I love reading, and I am very good at Chinese and English. I don't find Maths very interesting, so I am not good at it. I want to work hard at it. My teacher, classmates and my parents would like to help me with my Maths.",middle2391.txt
