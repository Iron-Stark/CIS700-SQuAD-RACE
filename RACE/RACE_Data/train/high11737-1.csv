1,D,"[""It's important not to hurt them in any way"", ""It's no use trying to stop their wrongdoing"", ""It's advisable to treat them as one's own kids"", ""It's possible for one to get into lots of trouble""]",What does the author say about dealing with other people's children?,"It was a lovely day at the park and Stella Bianchi was enjoying the sunshine with her two children when a young boy, aged about four, approached her two-year-old son and pushed him to the ground.
""I'd watched him for a little while and my son was the fourth or fifth child he'd pushed,"" she says. ""I went over to them, picked up my son, turned to the boy and said, firmly, 'No, we don't push.'"" What happened next was unexpected.
""The boy's mother ran toward me from across the park,"" Stella says, ""I thought she was coming over to apologize, but instead she started shouting at me for blaming her child.

In those situations, it's difficult to know whether to approach the child directly or the parent first. There are two opinions.
""I'd go to the child first,"" says Andrew Fuller, author of Tricky Kids. ""Usually a quiet reminder that 'we don't do that here' is enough. Kids have antennae   for how to behave in different settings.""
He points out bringing it up with the parent first may make them feel careless, which could cause problems. Of course, approaching the child first can bring its own headaches, too.
This is why White recommends that you approach the parents first. Raise your concerns with the parents and ask them to deal with it,"" she says.
Asked how to approach a parent in this situation, psychologist Meredith Fuller answers: ""Explain your needs as well as stressing the importance of the friendship. Start with something like: 'I know you'll think I'm silly but in my house I don't want...'""",high11737.txt
