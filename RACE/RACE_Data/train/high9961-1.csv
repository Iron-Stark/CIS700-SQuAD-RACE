1,A,"['The things in it help you recover.', 'It has plenty of fat and calories.', 'It helps increase the protein in your body.', 'It is an amazing source of carbohydrates.']",Why does the author advise eating a protein-packed sandwich after exercising?,"The meal you eat after exercising matters! No matter what time of day you exercise, the key is to follow the exercise up with meals that supply enough nutrition  . For the best results, eat within 30 to 60 minutes after exercising, when the muscles are at the best time to take in nutrients.
Here are some ideas for meals after exercising.
Home-made sports-recovery drink
Mix banana, milk, and yogurt to make a fresh and satisfying sports-recovery drink. Dairy products like milk and yogurt work double duty, providing both protein   and carbohydrates  . A cup of coffee, on the other hand, is a poor choice.
Protein-packed sandwich
You can't go wrong with a sandwich after exercising --it's got everything in a hand-held package. Sandwiches provide the salt you need to replace what you lost by sweating  , while the tomatoes in them supply plenty of Vitamin C. Try using whole-wheat bread to give yourself more fiber. The cheese and fresh vegetables in sandwiches are also great for helping tired muscles recover.
Power breakfast
An egg sandwich is a perfect post-exercise breakfast. There's protein in both the yolk and the white of the egg. This recipe increases your protein intake   while keeping calories and fat under control. Eggs also contain zinc  , which helps protect against disease.
Plant-based protein
Beans are an amazing source of plant-based protein and carbohydrates. Make a large bowl of bean salad in the beginning of a week, and you'll have a great post-exercise meal that's ready whenever you need it.",high9961.txt
