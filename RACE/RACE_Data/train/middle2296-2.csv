2,D,"['poor children', 'disabled children', 'country children', ""'left-behind' children""]","The proper title   for this passage is ""Give   _   more love"".","BEIJING--Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has visited the ""left-behind""  children whose parents are working in cities before Children's Day.
During a visit to northwest China's Shanxi Province, Wen visited the home of Yang Saike, a primary school boy in a village of Xingping City. Yang, whose parents were working in Fujian, thousands of kilometers away, was cared for by his grandparents. His parents fail to go home even once a year. Wen talked with many children and asked them many questions about their schooling and life.
""You are so pretty,"" Wen said to Liu Mengqi, a seven-year-old girl living with her grandmother. Liu's parents were also working in the city.
""Have you been to school yet?"" Wen asked two other girls.
""We are going to the pre-school class,"" said one.
""Mom and dad at home?"" Wen asked. The children shook their heads.
""Children cannot see their parents very often, which is a new problem in the country-side. We should give them more care and love,"" said the premier.
The premier asked local governments to do something to protect and care for such children at home and freeing their parents in cities from worries about their children.",middle2296.txt
