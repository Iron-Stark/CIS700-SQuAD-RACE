3,C,"['He turned up the TV.', 'He called the police.', 'He beat his drums.', 'He asked his parents for help.']",How did Bob do to make the man run away?,"Bob was only seven years old. One night Bob was at home alone while his parents were out for a party. He had often stayed alone before,so he wasn't afraid. As he waited for his parents to return home,he watched a film on TV. His eyes became heavier and heavier as time passed by.
Suddenly Bob's eyes opened wide--what was the sound in the next room? Bob heard the window being opened slowly. For a minute,Bob was so frightened that he could not move,and his body felt like ice. He knew that he couldn't lose his head and began to think of the things he could do. Again he heard the sound of someone trying to climb into his home through the window.
Bob's drums were standing in the corner near the TV. ""Wait,maybe there is something I can do,""thought Bob. He beat on his drums as hard as he could. The sound was so terrible that Bob surprised even himself. He also surprised the man in the window,who ran away as fast as possible.How clever he was!",middle6525.txt
