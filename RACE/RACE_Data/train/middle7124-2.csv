2,B,"['a normal holiday', 'a day that they can enjoy freedom', 'a dawn of a new day', 'a day of great importance for them']",Damini Bansal and his classmates treat Independence Day as .,"Damini Bansal (14 years old)
Freedom is something different in everybody's way of thinking--a student would probably like to raise a revolt  against all the obnoxious  rules of his or her school and as a grown up one might want to have less responsibilities .
Freedom according to me is the power in me to make some of my life's decisions on my own. And this Independence Day   will be a lot more different than our first one in 1947 when people actually came to know what it was like to be free, for them it was the dawn of a new day, it was a day when they could do what they felt was right.
We have come far from all of this. We now no longer see the Independence Day as a day of very great importance for the students of my class (and most of the children of my age), and the most important value is that it is a holiday.
