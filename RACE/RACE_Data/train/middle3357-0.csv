0,D,"['He was playing with his pet.', 'He was cleaning his bike.', 'He was drawing a picture.', 'He was playing with his friend.']",What was Peter doing when his mother called him home yesterday?,"Hello, I'm Peter in the second grade. Now I have one thing to say: It's not easy being a kid. Being a kid might look like fun, but sometimes it's not fun at all.
Yesterday I was playing outside with my friend. We were having a good time. But suddenly, my mother said, ""Peter, it's time to come inside now. It's getting dark."" When you're an adult, no one can tell you what to do or when to do it.
When you are a kid, you have to get up early in the morning and go to school. At school, you have to study math, English, science and history. After school, you have to do your homework. When you are an adult, you do not have to go to school and you never have homework to do.
When you are a kid, the older kids sometimes _ you. When I was walking home from school on Monday, Tom and Steve bothered me. Steve took my schoolbag and put it in a tree. It made me very mad. When you are an adult, no one can pick on you.
When you are a kid, you have to go to bed early. On school nights, my mom asks me to go to bed at 9:00 pm. But I do have parents who love me, which is really great. So I think I like being a kid, even though it's not easy being a kid.
