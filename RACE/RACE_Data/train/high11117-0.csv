0,D,"['in our eyes', 'only when we think very hard about something', 'only under the direction of a psychologist', ""in every person's mind""]",Perceiving is an action that takes place   _  .,"Ask three people to look out the same window at a busy street comer and tell you what they see. Chances are you will receive three different answers. Each person sees the same scene, but each perceives  something different about it.
Perceiving goes on in our minds. Of the three people who look out the window, one may say that he sees a policeman giving a motorist a ticket. Another may say that he sees a rush-hour traffic jam at the intersection. The third may tell you that he sees a woman trying to cross the street with four children in tow. For perception  is the minds' interpretation of what the senses -- in this case our eyes -- tell us.
Many psychologists today are working to try to determine just how a person experiences or perceives the world around him. Using a scientific approach, these psychologists set up experiments in which they can control all of the factors. By measuring and charting the results of many experiments, they are trying to find out what makes different people perceive totally different things about the same scene.",high11117.txt
