She likes dancing and singing and spends a lot of time on them. But she hates math and does not work hard at it. She thinks it difficult to learn. She falls behind her classmates and once failed the math exam. She decides to drop it. Her father is angry with her when he knows about it.
It was Sunday. Mr Scott gave a call to his sister, who teaches math in another school. He hoped she would come and tell his daughter how to learn math. The woman came quickly and said. ""You're a clever girl, Jane. I'm sure you'll soon do well in math if you work hard at it.""
""I'm afraid I can't, Aunt,"" said Jane, ""Girls can't be good at math.""
""I don't think so,"" said the woman. ""I was good at it when was a girl. You must do more exercises and practice a math problem again and again until you master it. Remember: Practice makes perfect. Well, it's a math problem. Think about it and practice it again, and you'll work it out.""
""OK,"" said the girl, ""Let me try.""

""Well done!"" her aunt said happily, ""What result did you get?""
""Ten answers.""",middle360.txt
