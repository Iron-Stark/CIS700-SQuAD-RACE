2,C,"['Because he had once experienced the same scene in Vietnam.', 'Because he had saved many children in dangerous situation', ""Because he remembered the Vietnamese girl's words all time long."", 'Because he knew some knowledge of first aid and medical care.']",Why was Butler so confident that the little girl would revive?  _  .,"Bob Butler lost his legs in a 1965 landmine explosion in Vietnam. He returned home as a war hero. Twenty years later,he proved once again that heroism comes from the heart.
Butler was working in his garage in a small town in Arizona on a hot summer day when he heard a woman's screams coming from a nearby house. He rolled his wheelchair toward the house,but the dense bush wouldn't allow him to approach the back door. So he got out of his chair and crawled through the dirt and bushes.
""I had to get there,""he says. ""It didn't matter how much it hurt.""
When Butler arrived at the house,he traced the screams to the pool,where a three year old girl,Stephanie,was lying at the bottom. She had been born without arms and had fallen in the water and couldn't swim. Her mother stood over her baby screaming loudly. Butler dove to the bottom of the pool and brought little Stephanie up to the deck. Her face was blue,she had no pulse and she was not breathing.
Butler immediately went to work performing CPR  to revive her while Stephanie's mother telephoned the fire department. She was told the rescue team was already out on a call .Helplessly,she sobbed and hugged Butler's shoulders.
As Butler continued with his CPR,he calmly reassured Stephanie's mother. ""Don't worry,""he said. ""I was her arms to get out of the pool. It'll be okay. I'm now her lungs. Together we can make it.""
Seconds later the little girl coughed,regained consciousness and began to cry. As they hugged and rejoiced together,the mother asked Butler how he knew it would be okay.
""When my legs were blown off in the war,I was all alone in a field,""he told her."" No one was there to help except a little Vietnamese girl. As she struggled to drag me into her village,she whispered in broken English,'It okay. You can live. I be your legs. Together we make it.'""
""This was my chance,""he told Stephanie's mom,""to return the favor.""",high9155.txt
