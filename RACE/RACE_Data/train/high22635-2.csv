2,B,"['whales and dolphins like helping humans', 'whales might inntate human voice', 'man paid attention to whales 100 years ago', 'whales will be able to communicate with humans']",It can be inferred from the text that  _  .,"Internet reports of whales sounding like people are not new. But in this case in San Diego, California, scientists for the first time recorded the utterances, did an acoustic analysis and were surprised to find a rhythm similar to that of human speech, Sam Ridgway of the National Marine Mammal Foundation reported on Monday. 
The sounds marking is quite special : Whales make sounds through the system of the nose, unlike people, who use their throat. So this particular with whale had to make some tricky  muscular and blowhole adjustments. ""Such obvious effort suggests motivation for relatin"", said Ridway, the main author of a study featured in the journal Current Biology. ""The sounds we heard were clearly an example of vocal learning by the white whale.""
The wale, named Noc, died five years ago. Ridgway says that back in 1984, he and others started hearing sounds near the whale and dolphin enclosure that recalled two people speaking in the distance, too far away to be understood. The sounds were later traced to one particular white whale when a diver in its tank came to the surface because he thought he heard colleagues tell him to do so. Noc had lived among dolphins and other white whales and had often been in the presence of humans. The whale made human-like sounds for around four years until it reached the age of sexual maturity, Ridgway said.",high22635.txt
