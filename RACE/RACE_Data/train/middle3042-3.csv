3,A,"['To give some advice on how to lose weight.', 'To advise people to eat apples every day.', 'To tell people how to enjoy a better life.', 'To advise people to give up bad habits.']",What's the purpose of the passage?,"This is not a diet. It's a simple way to lose weight~ And you don' t even have to give up the food you love or join a gym. You just follow some habits that thin people have. Keep them, and you'll become thin.
( 1 ) Wake - up
When you wake up in the morning, sit up slowly without using your hands. With legs straight out, bend( ) forward until you feel sore in your back. It will burn about 10 calories (,).
(2) Start with soup
When you have a meal, order a clear soup, and have it before having the main food. In this way, you'll feel fuller, so you'll eat less when the main food comes.
(3) An apple (or more) a day
Apples are full of fiber  and water, so your stomach will want less. The study shows that people who eat at least three, apples a day lose weight.
(4) Stand up and walk around
Every time you use the mobile phone, stand up and walk around.  Heavy people sit on average  two and a half hours more each day than thin people. This skill is very important as standing up and walking around will burn 50 or more calories.
Use these skills, and you will have a big weight loss.
