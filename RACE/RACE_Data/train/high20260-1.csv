    Following the yoga teacher's gentle instructions, Bai Yunuo,15, from the High School attached to Beijing Normal University tried to get each of her poses correct.
        Bai's school offered 24 elective courses   for Senor 1 students this term and she chose two. It was her first yoga class.
   ""I'm happy that I can learn yoga at school. I love dancing but I had some injuries on my knees when I was a kid. So I decide to try something soft. Simply stretching into different poses makes me feel free and quiet. And the music is quite comforting. The class is relaxing after a whole day's work,"" Bai said.
    Liu Zehao,15, found his interest was Junior Achievement  . The course brought students into the real world of business. In their first class, Liu and his group members named their company ""Vision"". Liu was elected as CEO of the company.
