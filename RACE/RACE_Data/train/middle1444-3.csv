3,D,"['old boxes', 'letter', 'birthday party', 'friendship']",The writer wrote the passage to tell us about her  _  with Minnie.,"When I tidied up some old boxes under my bed, I found an old letter for me from my best friend. Her name was Minnie.
In the letter, Minnie wrote, ""I am really sorry about before. Tell me if you will be my best friend again and tell me if you accept my _ . ""I wrote, ""YES. I will be your best friend. ""
The twelve-year-old letter made me remember the time that Minnie and I spent together. We often wrote to each other during that time. One minute, Minnie and I would be playing happily together; the other moment we would get into arguments. But things would always be better again. She gave me a doll for my tenth birthday. I still keep it.
Finally things changed. We stopped writing letters to each other after she moved away, and I could no longer ride my bike to her house. Years later, she invited me to her sixteenth birthday party. I don't see Minnie very often from then on. But I'll always keep the letter and I'll never forget the time we spent together.",middle1444.txt
