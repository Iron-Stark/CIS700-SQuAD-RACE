3,D,"['The ways to raise money.', 'The recycling bottles.', ""The dance team's costumes."", 'A closer dreaming.']",What's the best title for this passage?,"Jenny didn't know how her school dance team could pay for the travel to Florida for a national competition. It was difficult enough just to raise money for their dance costumes  .  What were they going to do? As the team leader, Jenny felt she needed to come up with an idea. .
At lunch, Jenny found that a lot of students were throwing empty juice bottles in the rubbish. She remembered the school had a recycling   program a few years ago, but it had ended.  Nobody wanted to bring the bags of bottles to the recycling center.
Jenny saw a chance. She went to see the  headmaster.  ""If members of our team pick up the  recyclable bottles every few days, may we use the money we collect at the recycling center for our dance team?"" asked Jenny.
""I think that's a great idea, Jenny,"" said  Ms. Weaver.  ""But if another team wants to take over next season, I'll have to give them a chance, too. "" Jenny agreed that it was fair.  She ran to the dance team to give them the good news.
Jenny knew that the money raised from empty bottles might not be enough to get them all the way to Florida, but they were a lot closer. She would find more ways to raise money for the dance team.",middle5227.txt
