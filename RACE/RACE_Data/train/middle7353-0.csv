0,C,"['To help support his family.', 'To buy a gift for his Mom.', 'To buy a new computer game.', 'To buy some golf gloves.']",For what purpose did Michael want to make money?,"Michael wanted to make some money to buy a new computer game, but he did not know how. So he went to ask his brother Greg for help.
""I think you could help to wash Mom's and Dad's cars,"" Greg said, ""Some of the neighbors could pay you to wash theirs, too. It's getting colder and no one wants to wash the cars themselves.""
Michael agreed, but he shivered at the thought of washing cars and getting wet in cold weather.""Maybe this isn't a good idea.""
""Don't worry,"" Greg said. ""I have some golf gloves .You can use them to wash cars. and I will even help you to  wash the cars.""""Thank you!""Michael said.
After spending the day washing cars, Michael got enough money and went to the store with Greg. He found the game he wanted quickly, but as he took it off the shelf he saw a golf video game next to it. He knew Greg loved golf and wouldn't play golf in winter, so he put his game back and decided to buy the golf video game.
""What are you doing?"" Greg asked. ""I thought this game would be more fun."" said Michael. ""We can play it together.""",middle7353.txt
