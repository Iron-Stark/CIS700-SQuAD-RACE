UP-CYCLING
Every student needs school supplies. But a lot of what they need is already littering around your house. If you don't have reusable school supplies at home, you might have the materials to make them.
Try up-cycling with your kids and change old or useless products into new ones.
Here are a few ideas to get you started:
*Sew blue jeans into pencil cases.
*Turn shoeboxes into arts storage boxes.
*Use an old belt as a books belt.
*Wrap book covers in old posters.
Up-cycling is a great way to develop artistic talent and creative thinking in your children.

MAP IT OUT
Across the country, kids are thinking about how they'll get to school. Do I walk? Do I bike? Either way, avoid driving them if at all possible.
Kids need to stay active and want to connect with other local kids on the way to school. Help your children map out their route or get them involved with a local walking school bus. A walking school bus is groups of children walking to school with one or more adults.
