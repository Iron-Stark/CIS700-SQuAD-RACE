1,D,"['They are heavy metals.', 'They were made in labs.', ""They can't be found in nature."", 'They are widely used in our daily lives.']",Which of the following about the new elements is NOT true?,"Have you heard about the periodic table   lately? Well, there's some big news about this special table, but first, remember that the periodic table is used for all the elements , or things that make up our world.
Elements are all around us. Iron is one of the most common elements found on the earth. You probably know the element oxygen  , which is the element that we breathe in all the time. And elements can combine   to make new things like H2O. This is hydrogen   and oxygen put together, also known as water! Learning about these things helps us better understand the world we live in.
But have you ever noticed something missing in the periodic table? There were already 114 elements. But the seventh row of the table was not finished, until now!
In December, scientists from the IUPAC  found the four elements that were missing. They are elements 113, 115, 117 and 118.
""To scientists, this is of greater value than an Olympic gold medal,"" Ryoji Noyori, a Nobel honored chemist said.
The new elements are heavy metals and were made in lab. These kinds of elements can't be found in nature. Scientists are still looking for ways to use these elements, and other elements in the eighth row in our daily lives.
Scientists have been working on this for 10 years, but the work is not done. Now they will prepare to look for ""element 119 and _ "". But for now, be mindful   when you read your science books because the periodic table might be outdated  .",middle6841.txt
