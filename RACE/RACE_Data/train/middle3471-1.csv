My favorite sweater grew too small.
I loved that sweater best of all.
My grandma made it when I was three.
She made that sweater just for me.
I picked the yarn , a special blue.
The color of bluebells .wet with dew .
When I was three I was very small,
But now I'm five and much too tall.
I have a new jacket now that's green,
So I gave my sweater to our cat Queen.
Queen just had babies out in the shed .
My favorite sweater is now in their bed.",middle3471.txt
