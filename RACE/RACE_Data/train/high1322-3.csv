3,D,"['Gestures', 'Feelings', 'Culture and Understanding', 'Gestures and Feelings']",The best title for this passage can be   _   .,"People often use gestures to express our feelings, but the problem is that the gestures can be understood in different ways.
It is true that a smile means the same thing in any language.  So does laughter or crying.  Fear is another emotion  that is shown in much the same way all over the world.  In Chinese and in English literature, a phrase like ""he went pale and began to tremble"" suggests that the man is either very afraid or he has just got a very big shock.
However, ""he opened his eyes wide"" is used to suggest anger in Chinese whereas in English it means surprise. In Chinese, surprise can be described in a phrase like ""they stretched out their tongues!"" ""Stretching out your tongue"" in English is an insulting(, )gesture or expresses strong dislike.
Even in the same culture, people differ in their ability to understand and express feelings.  Experiments in America have shown that women are usually better than men at recognizing fear,  anger,  love and happiness on people's faces. Other studies show that older people usually find it easier to understand body language than younger people do.",high1322.txt
