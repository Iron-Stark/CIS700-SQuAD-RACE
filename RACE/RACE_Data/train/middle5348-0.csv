One day Mike read something about phones and he was interested in it. He asked his father a few questions, and his father answered all.  His father said, "" Fathers always know much, but sons always know little!"" The boy thought for a minute and said,"" I don't agree with  you.""
""Oh? Why?""
Mike didn't answer but asked, ""Who invented the phone?""
""Bell."" answered Mr. Green.
""Why didn't his father invent them?""
