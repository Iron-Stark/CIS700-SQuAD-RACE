0,B,"['The authorities.', 'A passer-by.', 'Emergency responders.', 'Her families.']",Who found the severely damaged car?,"Camilla Broomstick, a missing Camden -area woman, was reported found inside her damaged Chevrolet Malibu Sunday afternoon in a County near Camden New Jersey, at the bottom of an embankment  off a highway, according to authorities. Her car, turned upside down, was spotted by a passer-by who had stopped to view scenery and noticed something shining and what looked like a body, authorities said. When emergency responders arrived, they found Broomstick alive inside her severely damaged car. The vehicle rested upside down after flying 120 feet off the highway and rolling an additional 200 feet into an aspen woods.
""The crash alone would have killed her,"" New Jersey State Trooper Dean Enoch said. ""It's surprising that she survived the crash at all, and then to be down there for that amount of days without food or water.""
Earlier Monday, the family released a statement at the hospital thanking emergency responders who rushed Broomstick to the hospital and to the man who found her and notified authorities.
""We sincerely appreciate all the thoughts, prayers and kind gestures from the community during such a hard time for our family,"" the statement read. ""While we're hopeful of her prognosis , Camilla was seriously injured and with multiple internal and external injuries. Later this afternoon Camilla will be undergoing surgery here to amputate  both of her feet. Doctors were not able to save her feet due to the serious injuries. Camilla is in critical but stable condition at this time and has a very long road ahead.""
In the statement, family members mentioned reports that Broomstick wrote a request for help on an umbrella she pushed out the car window. ""We cannot comment on that right now because we have not seen the umbrella,"" the statement said. Family members also asked that the public respect their privacy.",high9181.txt
