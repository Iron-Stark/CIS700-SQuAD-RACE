Once he was making a television commercial  . All Michael needed to do in the advertisement was to miss a shot.
For Michael, this was difficult. He had conditioned himself to succeed whenever he was throwing the ball. Every time he threw a basketball, it went in. Every time he tried to miss a shot, he failed. In total, it took him over 20 attempts   before he missed a shot.
For Michael, success is a strong habit. He had formed a habit that was so strong that it took him a lot of time to break it and ""fail"".
