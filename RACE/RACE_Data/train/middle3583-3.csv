3,C,"['he loved the one people chose', 'people loved the one he chose', 'he chose to live', 'he chose to die']","When the writer got hurt in a car accident,  _  .","Mike was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always happy and always had something interesting to say. If someone asked him how he was doing, he would reply, ""Couldn't be better!"" He was really a care-free young man and never felt tired.
Mike used to say, ""Each morning I wake up and say to myself, 'Mike, you have two choices  today. You can choose to be happy or you can choose to be upset.' I choose to be happy. Each time something happens, I am always ready to learn a good lesson. I choose to learn from life.""
I tried to understand what he said. Indeed life is all about choices. Every situation is a choice. The bottom line is: You're living your life and you make it either happy or sad.
Several years later I had a car accident and my legs were seriously injured. When I was lying on the ground, I remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live or choose to die. I chose to live.
People like to say, ""Choose the one you love and love the one you choose."" Why not choose the one we love and live happily?",middle3583.txt
