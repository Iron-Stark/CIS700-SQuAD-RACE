0,D,"[""a person's birth season might affect their monoamine neurotransmitters"", 'monoamine neurotransmitters might be connected to our emotions', ""people's personalities might depend on environmental factors"", ""the season of a person's birthday may affect their personality""]",The study from Semmelweis University in Hungary intended to prove that   _  .,"""You get excited about everything because you were born in the summer!"" Does that sound like something your grandparents used to say to you?
Of course, you're a learned person who doesn't believe in such things. But scientists now say that it might not all be superstition  .
Researchers from Semmelweis University in Hungary recently asked 366 university students to fill out a questionnaire. The answers given included things like ""My mood often changes for no reason"", ""I love to deal with new projects, even if they're risky "", and ""I complain a lot"". They then compared students' answers to their birthdays. They found that the season of your birth may have some effect on who you are.
Researchers found that people born in the summer were more likely to quickly change between sad and happy emotions. People born in the winter, however, were less likely to become angry. Spring birthdays were more likely to make people overly positive, while people born in autumn were less likely to be depressive  .
So, why could the seasons cause such differences?
""Biochemical studies have shown that the season in which you are born affects some monoamine neurotransmitters  ,"" lead researcher Xenia Gonda said in a written statement. ""This led us to believe that birth season may have a longer-lasting effect.""
Monoamine neurotransmitters are given off from neurones  . They affect our emotions. So the researchers believe they might have an effect on the development of our personalities.
Different seasons also have different food and nutrients   to offer. In addition, mothers usually get more physical exercise and enjoy more sunlight in warm seasons than in cold seasons. All these are ""environmental factors "" which may influence a person's personality, said Gonda.
But the research only included a survey and didn't follow participants over time. More research is needed before a final answer can be given on the connection between season and personality.
Don't worry, though. Even if the connection is proven, it won't mean that your birth month completely decides who you are. Being happy or sad is up to you.",high12904.txt
