0,B,"['her doorstep became very clean', 'she heard the hen making sounds loudly', 'she noticed the children in the tree', 'her cat Michael managed to get her attention']",Mrs. Taylor stopped sweeping when  _  .,"Outside her cottage, old Mrs. Taylor was hanging out laundry on a wire line, unaware that some children were hiding in a nearby tree watching her every move. They were determined to find out if she really was a witch. 
They watched nervously as she took a broomstick to sweep the dirt from her stone steps. But much to their disappointment, she didn't get on the broomstick and fly off. The old lady only looked up when her hen began to make sounds loudly --signaling that she had laid an egg in the nest on the top of the haystack. .
The old lady put aside her broomstick and walked to the haystack, followed by Michael, a black cat she had rescued from a fox trap. With only three legs, it was hard for Michael to keep up with his mistress. The cat was proof for the children that only a witch would own a black cat with three legs! Crawling further along the branches, they could clearly see the haystack.
Mrs. Taylor was standing on a wooden box with the new-laid egg in one hand. Placing the egg in her pocket, she readied herself to climb down. Then, without warning, the box broke under her and she crashed to the ground. The children were in horror.
""Should we go and help her?"" asked Mia.
""What if it's a trick?"" replied Patrick. ""She probably knows we're here. Witches know things like that!""
After thinking for a while, Julia said""Anyway, we should go and check whether she is all right.""
Approaching _ , they could see a wound on the old lady's forehead. She had knocked her head on a stone and was unconscious.
""Go and get Dad,"" Mia yelled to her brothers. ""Tell him about the accident.""
The boys didn't need another excuse to leave. They ran as fast as they could for help, hoping that Mrs. Taylor would not regain consciousness and turn the girls into frogs.
Later, in the hospital, the old lady smiled her thanks. ""I was so lucky that you lovely children happened to be passing when 1 fell. I must have yelled quite loudly.""
The children exchanged guilty glances, but were very pleased that she was not a witch after all!",high14079.txt
