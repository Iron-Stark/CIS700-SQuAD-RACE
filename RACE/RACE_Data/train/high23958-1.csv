1,C,"['Pearlcorder S 702', 'Sony M9', 'Sony M400', 'Philips 585']",If you want a machine which turns off automatically and weighs very little you should choose   _  .,"The following are the results of the tests done by ""Family and Home Magazine"" on some Pocket Tape-Recorders on the market now.
  Pearlcorder S702 $64
  This simple model at the bottom of the Olympus range scored the most points for its excellent quality of recording. Background noise hardly affects the sound and recording from a pocket is perfectly possible, but it doesn't turn off automatically.
  Tape length: 30minutes per side. Weight: 240g.
  Sony M9   $49.95
  Small and very good looking, Sony's latest offering scored most for its appearance. Sounds clear, but there is slight machine noise. The big control buttons are a great improvement on some of the complicated little controls on other tape-recorders. It doesn't switch off automatically, but a red light shows if the machine is still running.
  Tape length: 60minutes per side. Weight: 195g.
  Sony M400  $115
  Lots of little control buttons that make a noise are difficult to use. Recording is good but machine noise loses points. Tape counter and automatic switch-off when tape has finished recording or rewinding are useful.
  Tape length: 60 minutes per side. Weight: 230g.
  Imperial OEM MC7  $ 29.95
  Cheap and simple compared with the rest, but recording is good as long as there is no background noise. Use only its own-make of cassette. No light to show it is on; no fast-forward button and the record button makes a loud noise.
  Tape length: 30 minutes per side. Weight: 285g.
  Philips 585  $80
  Handsome and simple to use, but recording is very poor at more than the recommended distance of 5 cm-designed for dictation. No recording light.
  Tape length: 15 minutes per side. Weight: 220g.",high23958.txt
