I was not sure about entering a new decade of my life and feared that my best years were now behind me.
My daily routine included going to the gym for a workout( ) before going to work. Every morning I would see my friend Nicholas at the gym. He was seventy nine years old and in terrific shape. As I greeted Nicholas on that particular day, he noticed I wasn't full of my usual vitality and asked if there was anything wrong. I told him I was feeling anxious about turning thirty. I wondered how I would look back on( )my life once I reached Nicholas's age, so I asked him, ""What was the best time of your life?""
Without hesitation, Nicholas replied, ""Well, Joe, this is my philosophical answer to your philosophical question:
When I was a child in Austria and everything was taken care of for me and I was _ by my parents, that was the best time of my life.
When I was going to school and learning the things I know today, that was the best time of my life.
When I got my first job and had responsibilities and got paid for my efforts, that was the best time of my life.
When I met my wife and fell in love, that was the best time of my life.
The Second World War came, and my wife and I had to flee Austria to save our lives. When we were together and safe on a ship bound for North America, that was the best time of my life.
When we came to Canada and started a family, that was the best time of my life.
When I was a young father, watching my children grow up, that was the best time of my life.""
""And now, Joe, I am seventy nine years old. I have my health, I feel good and I am in love with my wife just as I was when we first met. This is the best time of my life.""",high2473.txt
