0,B,"['Her husband was cured of his cancer.', 'She was strong-willed and considerate.', 'She was in despair and pretended to forget what she said.', 'Her daughter completely understood the situation her family was in.']",What do we know about the mother in the story?,"She had been shopping with her Mom in Wal-Mart.She must have been 6 years old, this beautiful brown haired, freckle-faced image of innocence.Outside, it was pouring so heavily.
We all stood there just inside the door of the Wal-Mart.We waited, some patiently, others annoyed because nature messed up their hurried day.I got lost in the sound and sight of the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of the world.
Her voice was so sweet as it broke the hypnotic trance   we were all caught in.""Mom, let's run through the rain,"" she said.
""No, honey.We'll wait until it slows down a bit,"" Mom replied.
This young child waited about another minute and repeated: ""Mom, let's run through the rain.""
"" We'll get wet totally if we do,"" Mom said.
""No, we won't, Mom.That's not what you said this morning,"" the young girl said as she tore at her Mom's arm.
""This morning? When did I say we could run through the rain and not get wet?""
""Don't you remember? When you were talking to Daddy about his cancer, you said, If God can get us through this, he can get us through anything!""
The entire crowd stopped dead silent.I dare say you couldn't hear anything but the rain.We all stood silently. No one came or left in. the next few minutes,Mom paused and thought for a moment about what she would say.
Now some would laugh it off and scold her for being silly.Some might even ignore what was said. But this was a moment of _ in a young child's lifetime when innocent trust can be developed so that it will bloom into faith.""Honey, you are absolutely right.Let's run through the rain.If get wet, well maybe we just need washing,"" Mom said.Then off they ran.
We all stood watching, smiling and laughing as they rushed past the cars and they held their shopping bags over their heads just in case.They got soaked.But they were followed by a few who screamed and laughed like children all the way to their cars.And yes, I did.I ran.I got wet.I needed washing.
You may lose your material possessions, your money and even your health, but no one can ever take away your precious memories.So don't forget to make time and take the opportunities to make memories.",high2118.txt
