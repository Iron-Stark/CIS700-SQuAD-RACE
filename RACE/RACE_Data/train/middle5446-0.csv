0,B,"['Why soccer is so popular in Germany?', 'What has made Germany a successful soccer team.', 'The failures and successes of the German soccer team.', 'How the German soccer team became the world champions  this summer.']",What is the passage mainly about?,"Who could forget those sleepless nights last summer watching Germany beat Brazil  and Argentina  to win the 2014 World Cup in Brazil?
It was their fourth World Cup, and it gave them the No.1 position in FIFA . Germany is becoming the most important soccer team in the world. But how has this change happened? A newspaper offers a clue: ""For over 10 years, German teams have been building in the right way.""
After Germany scored only one goal at the 2000 European Championships, Germans wondered why the country no longer produced good young players. So in 2001, the German Football League required that all Bundesliga   clubs set up schools with youth teams from Under-12s to Under-23s.
The clubs now spend over EUR100 million (764 million yuan) on youth development every year. And they have improved young German players enough to put them among the best in Europe. For example, Bayern Munich  player Thomas Mueller, 25, who scored five times at the 2014 World Cup, was educated in one of the schools.
More than anything, though, it is team work that has pushed the Bundesliga forward. Bayern is the richest team in Germany, but the team helps its rivals   when needed.
Through the country's World Cup performances , the German soccer tradition is doing better than ever. Germany can play on top of the world for a few years yet.",middle5446.txt
