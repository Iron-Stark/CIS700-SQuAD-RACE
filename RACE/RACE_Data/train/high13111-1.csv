1,C,"['Learning skills.', 'Learning methods.', 'Learning attitudes.', 'Learning experience.']",What is the main idea of the passage?,"When I was a kid, I was just like every other kid. As usual, I liked being with friends and having fun. But I didn't like school much. I didn't like the rule of learning, studying, memorizing, etc. Too much work. As I got into high school, things changed for me. I started reading a lot of books. Books taught me about life and helped me learn about the world. I read around 30 books during each senior year. I learned to love reading then.
Little did I know at that time that I would write books by myself. I've written 7 books since then. One book I wrote, Powerful Attitudes, was a huge success within a network marketing company in the USA.
When I was 17 years old, I took about a dozen guitar lessons. I fell in love with guitar music no matter if it is blues, rock, flamenco or classical. I've attended concerts and have heard some great guitarists through the years.  Recently, I bought myself a piano and began to learn to play it. I've made great progress. My knowledge of music and playing guitar has helped me a lot in learning the piano.
Last week, I employed a Chinese teacher to teach me Chinese. I've learned about 200 words in my first week. I'm inspired and motivated to learn. In fact, I feel a bit _ , thinking of learning Chinese. It's like a mountain I want to climb and conquer. I'm 56 years old and my love to learn it runs deep in my heart, mind and soul.
What I certainly learned while growing up is to love learning. I never want to stop learning. I never want to stop studying people, life, processes and new things. I think the openness of admitting what you don't know, makes you a good learner. You never lie to yourself or to others about your knowledge and experience. I have the attitude that if I don't know something, I will learn to know it.",high13111.txt
