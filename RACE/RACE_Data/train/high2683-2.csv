2,C,"['The author would buy Suzan some candies.', 'The author would get angry with Robbie.', 'Suzan would play happily with the little animals.', 'The author would play together with Suzan.']",What might happen next according to the story?,"I took my 9-year-old daughter,Suzan and 5-year-old son,Robbie to the shopping centre.As we got there,we saw a big sign that said,""Petting Zoo"".The kids jumped up and asked,""Daddy,can we go?""
Both my wife and I were out of work.However,I said,""Sure"",giving them a quarter each. They went away, leaving only fifty cents left in my pocket.
A petting zoo is made up of a hundred of little baby animals of all kinds.Kids pay their money and stay in the enclosure pleased with the little animals while their parents shop.
A few minutes later,I saw Suzan walking along behind me.I was surprised and asked what was wrong.
She said sadly,""Well,Daddy,a ticket for Petting Zoo costs fifty cents.So I gave Robbie my quarter."" Then she said _ I ever heard.She repeated the family motto ,which is ""Love is Action!""
I knew clearly no one loves little animals more than Suzan. She had watched both my wife and me do and say ""Love is Action!"" for years,and now she had put it into her lifestyle.It had become part of her,because she knew the whole family motto.It's not only ""Love is Action"";it's ""Love is SACRIFICAL Action!"" Love always pays a price.
I was moved.We went back to the Petting Zoo.Suzan stood with her hands and chin resting on the fence and just watched Robbie go crazy petting and feeding the animals.I had fifty cents burning a hole in my pocket. I put my hand into my pocket and took out the money.Sure,I must do that !",high2683.txt
