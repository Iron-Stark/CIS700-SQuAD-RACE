They were on a long journey. One of the men was a businessman. The other was a farmer. They sat without talking for a while, then the farmer said,""Let's do something to pass the time.""
""What do you want to do?"" the businessman asked. ""We can ask each other riddles."" The farmer said,""You start.""""Let's make the rules first,"" the businessman said. ""That's not fair. You are a businessman with much knowledge. You know more things than I do. I am just a farmer.""
""That's true."" The businessman said. ""What do you want we should do?"" ""If you don't know the answer to a riddle, you pay me $100. And if I don't know the answer, I'll pay you $50."" The farmer said. The businessman thought about this, then he said, ""OK. That's fair. Who will go first?""
""I will,"" The farmer said. ""Here is my riddle. What has three legs when it walks, but only two legs when it flies?"" The business man repeated the riddle, ""What has three legs when it walks, but only two legs when it flies? Mm, that's a good one. I'm afraid I don't know the answer."" He gave the farmer $100, then said, ""Tell me the answer. What has three legs when it walks, but only two legs when it flies?""""I don't know."" The farmer said and gave him $50.",high12219.txt
