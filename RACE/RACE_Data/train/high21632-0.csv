But Picasso, the great Spanish painter, was like a man who had not yet found his own particular style of painting.   He kept on struggling to find the perfect expression till his death in 1973.
    Some of Picasso's paintings are rich, soft color1ed and beautiful. Others are ugly and cruel and strange. But such paintings allow us to imagine things for ourselves. They force us to say to ourselves, ""What does he see that makes him paint like that?"" And we begin to look beneath the surface of the things we see.
    Picasso painted thousands of pictures in different styles. Sometimes he painted the natural look of things. Sometimes he seemed to break them apart and throw the pieces in our faces.
