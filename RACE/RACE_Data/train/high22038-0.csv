0,C,"['In 1952.', 'In 1951.', 'In 1935.', 'In 1927.']",When did the parents have their first son according to the passage?,"My father quit driving in 1927, when he was 25 years old.So my brother and I grew up in a household without a car.In 1951,when my brother turned 16, my parents bought a used 1950 Chevrolet from a friend.Since my parents didn't drive, it more or less became my brother's car.
Having a car but not being able to drive didn't bother my father, but it didn't make sense to my mother.So in 1952, when she was 43 years old, she learned to drive.For the next 45 years or so, until she was 90, my mother was the driver in the family.
After my father retired when he was 70, he almost always accompanied my mother whenever she drove anywhere, even if he had no reason to go along.One day my father said to me, ""Do you want to know the secret of a long life?""
         ""I guess so,"" I said, knowing it probably would be something bizarre  .
         ""No left turns."" he said.
         ""What?"" I asked. 
""No left turns,"" he repeated.""Think about it.Three rights are the same as a left and that's a lot safer.Several years ago, your mother and I read an article that said most accidents that old people are in happen when they turn left in front of oncoming traffic.As you get older, your eyesight worsens.So your mother and I decided never again to make a left turn.""
""You're kidding!"" I said, and I turned to my mother for support.""No."" she said. ""Your father is right.We make three rights.It works."" But then she added: ""Except when your father  _ .""
         ""Loses count?"" I asked.
         ""Yes,"" my father admitted, ""that sometimes happens.But it's not a problem.You just make seven rights, and you're okay again.""
         I couldn't resist.""Do you ever go for 11 ?"" I asked.
         ""No,"" he said ""If we miss it at seven, we just come home and call it a bad day.
         Besides, nothing in life is so important it can't be put off another day or another week.""
         My mother was never in an accident all through her life.",high22038.txt
