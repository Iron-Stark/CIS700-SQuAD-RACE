I really need some rest,"" he heard the traveler say.""What are you talking about?"" the seed quickly asked. He thought the man was making fun of him. No one ever spoke to him like that.
""Who just spoke?"" the shocked man asked.""It is me. A seed."" ""A seed?"" The man looked at the big tree. ""Are you joking? You are not a seed. You are a big tree!""
""Really?""
""Yes! Why do you think people come here?""
