We were happy because it was a sunny day. However, in the afternoon , when we finished our picnic , it was dark and windy. Soon ,there was a shower. Unluckily, none of us brought an umbrella. We ran about but we could find no place to hide .
Twenty minutes passed and it was still raining .There were hours to go before we reached the campsite . It was even worse that our compass showed that we went to the wrong way. We had lost our way!
We had to make a quick decision as it was raining heavily. Chris said we could set up a tent  to hide in, so Mary and Tom helped to set up _ . Chris and I tried to make a fire to keep up warm.
