3,B,"['There was flood.', 'The snowstorm came in.', 'The winds were terribly strong.', 'The rain kept coming down.']",What did not happen when the typhoon came?,"My family lives very happily on a farm near a small town. My father always learns some information about weather through the TV, the Internet and newspapers.
One evening, he asked us to meet at the table after dinner. ""I have some bad news,"" he said. ""The weather reports on the television warned that we would face a typhoon tomorrow.""
At 6.30 a.m. the next day, the winds started and the rain was falling heavily. There were new warnings that the sea level could go up as much as 5 meters.
The winds were terribly strong and tree branches were flying everywhere. Trees were falling down and the rain kept coming down.
Just after 10:30, the wind stopped suddenly-it was strangely calm and the sun was shining. Then the winds came howling again, but this time more rain fell. There were more flying things and the storm came in. Everything within 1 km of the coast was flooded-there was fish in the streets. Now the winds were dying down, but the rain was still falling.
After another two hours, the wind came to a stop at last. My home was in a mess and my mum burnt her arm when the hot water from the stove hit her skin. We were all frightened, but we were all safe, including the cat.",middle7876.txt
