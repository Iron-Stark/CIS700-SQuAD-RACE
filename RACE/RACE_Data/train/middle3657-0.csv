0,D,"['It told her to swim in the lake.', 'It told her to play by the lake.', 'It told her to catch fish for him.', 'It taught her how to fish.']",What did a fox tell Mother Bear to do on a cold winter day?,"On a cold winter day, a fox told Mother Bear that he would teach her how to fish. For she wanted to learn, he took her to a hole in the ice, and told her to put her tail  down into the water.
He told her to keep the tail there for a long time. Then when she pulled the tail out of the water, she would find fish around the tail.
The bear was foolish enough to believe what the fox said. She sat for a long time with her tail in the water. She was waiting for the fish. But when she tried to pull her tail out of the water she found that it was frozen  in the ice.
She asked the fox to pull her out, but the fox laughed to itself and ran away. So she called Father Bear to help her.
Father Bear came. He pulled her hard and at last got her out. But a part of her tail was in the ice. That is why people find the bear's tail so short.",middle3657.txt
