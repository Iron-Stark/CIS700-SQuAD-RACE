Apply direct pressure. Place a clean, folded cloth over the injured area and firmly apply pressure. If blood soaks through, do not remove it. Instead, cover that cloth with another one and continue to apply pressure to the wound for 7~10 minutes. If the bleeding is from the ear, place a clean bandage over the ear, lay the victim on his side, and allow the blood to drain out through the bandage.
Elevate the injury. Position the wounded part of the body above the level of the heart if possible while you apply direct pressure.
Know the pressure points. If direct pressure and elevation don't sufficiently slow the blood-flow, find a pressure point. Large arteries   found close to the skin's surface supply blood to the head and to each arm and leg. The most common pressure points used during the first aid are located in the upper arms and in the creases above the upper legs. Apply pressure to the closest pressure point to the wound so that the artery is pressed between your fingers and the bone directly behind the artery. If using the pressure point on a leg, you may need to use the heel of your hand instead of your finger.
Resort to a tourniquet (,). On very rare occasions everything listed above may fail. To prevent the victim from dying, you should apply a tourniquet. Once a tourniquet is applied, it should not be loosened or removed until the victim has reached medical help. Use a tourniquet ONLY if everything listed above has failed. If you use a tourniquet, write down somewhere on the victim the time when it was applied, so medical personal will know how long it has been in place.",high10380.txt
