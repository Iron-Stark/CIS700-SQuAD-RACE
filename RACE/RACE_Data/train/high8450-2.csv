2,A,"['he only focused on the present', 'he preferred the present to Santa Claus', 'he had never received any presents before', 'he was too young to know what was more important']",Rodd missed Santa Claus because  _  .,"Rodd and Todd were lucky children chosen to see Santa Claus himself up at the North Pole. Some elves  come in and said, ""Santa Claus is very busy. You'll only be able to see him for a short while, so make the most of it.""
Santa Claus appeared, carrying all the toys the two boys had ever wanted. While Todd ran to hug Santa Claus, Rodd went over to the bicycle he had always dreamed of having. Santa was only there for a few seconds, and disappeared before Rodd had even looked at him. He cried and complained, but within a few hours the two boys had been returned to their homes.
From that day on, every time Rodd saw a toy he felt the excitement of receiving a present, but he would instantly look around to see what else of importance he was missing. And in this way, Rodd helped those who had nothing, giving love to those who almost never received it, and putting smiles on the faces of the unhappy. All by himself, he managed to change the atmosphere of his town, and no one could know him without being grateful to him.
One Christmas, while he was sleeping, he felt someone pulling his leg. Rodd opened his eyes and saw the long white beard and the soft red suit. ""Forgive me. I didn't know how to choose what was most important,"" said Rodd. But Santa Claus answered with a smile. ""I chose to spend some time with the best boy in the world, just before I leave you the great gift you've earned for yourself. Thank you!"" And the next morning, there were no presents under the Christmas tree. That Christmas, the gift had been so big that it couldn't fit down the chimney; the only place it could fit was in Rodd's heart.",high8450.txt
