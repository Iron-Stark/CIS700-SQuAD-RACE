2,D,"['The Success of Cloning Humans', 'The Anger at Cloning Humans', 'Failure of Cloning Humans', 'First Cloned Human']",Which is the best title for the embryo?,"Rome-Doctors and medical groups around the world last weekend reacted with strong opposition to the news that an Italian specialist is _ cloning the first human baby.
    DL Severino Antinod,who is the head of a hospital in Rome,has been referred to in an Arab newspaper as claiming that one of his patients is eight weeks pregnant with a cloned baby.
    Antinori refused to comment on the reports,but in March 2001 he said he hoped to produce a cloned embryo for implantation within two years.So far seven different kinds of mammals have already successfully cloned,including sheep,cats and most recently rabbits.
Doctors showed their doubt and were strongly opposed although they admit that human cloning would finally come true unless there was a world wide ban on the practice.
       Professor Rudolf Jaenisch of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says,""I find it astonishing that people do this where the result can be foretold that it will not be a normal baby.It is using humans as guinea pigs.It makes people feel sick.""But Ronald Green,director of the Ethics institute at Darmouth College in the US,said it is unlikely that an eight-week-old pregnancy would lead to a birth.
    So far all cloned animals have suffered from some different serious disorders,many of them dying soon after their births.
    Doctors are opposed to human cloning because they are worried about the welfare of the cloned child if there is one.
    ""There are no benefits of cloned human begins,just harm.""said Dr.Michael Wilks of the UK.",high23876.txt
