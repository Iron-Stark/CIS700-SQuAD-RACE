0,B,"['Kruger Park', 'GLTP', 'South African National Park', 'African wildlife Foundation']",_   is being established to relocate some African animals.,"Herds of zebra, impala and giraffe from South Africa's Kruger Park found a new home as part of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park (GLTP) wildlife relocation project.
  About 1,000 animals, from the large blue wildebeest to the stocky warthog, have been relocated to the park straddling South African, Mozambican and Zimbabwean territory.
  The game from South Africa arrived in the Massingir area of Mozambique's southern Maputo province after a one-and-a-half-hour trip by truck.
  South African National Parks chief executive Mavuso Msimang and the Peace Parks Foundation officially handed over the animals to Mozambican representatives. 
  ""This project is not only about the management of an ecosystem, but also about community empowerment and tourism,"" Msimang said.
  Border fences are coming down with the establishment of the park, which will be the world's biggest game reserve, to allow elephants and other herds to follow ancient migration routes.
  The park, due to be officially opened next year, will be bigger than the Netherlands, covering some 38,600 square kilometers (15,440 square miles).
  Under a three-year plan, about 6,000 animals are to be moved into the area, where wildlife was decimated during Mozambique's 25-year civil war.
  African Wildlife Foundation community development officer Jeremiah Machavi said 62 communities living in the area would be affected by the establishment of Transfrontier Park. Tourists will be able to travel across international boundaries in the park without having to show their passports.
The relocation process started in October last year when about 30 elephants were released into the park.",high21801.txt
