2,A,"[""Passing The Torch: A Firefighter Dad's Legacy"", 'Putting Out Fire: A Challenging Job for Father and son', 'Dekalb Walcott III: A Second-generation Firefighter', 'Dekalb Walcott Jr.: A Chicago Fire Chief']",Which of the following is the best title of the passage?,"When Dekalb Walcott III was just 8 years old, his father, a Chicago fire chief, let him _ on a call. Dekalb says a lot of kids idolized basketball player Michael Jordan when he was growing up in Chicago in the 1990s. Not him.
""I wanted to be like Dekalb Walcott Jr.,"" he says of his father.
So when his dad asked if he wanted to go on that call with him when he was 8, Dekalb was excited. ""I'm jumping up and down, saying, ""Mom, can I go? Can I go?' ""
The experience changed Dekalb's life, he tells his dad on a visit to StoryCorps. ""My eyes got big from the moment the alarm went off."" the younger Dekalb says. "" This is the life that I want to live someday. ""
Now 27, the younger Dekalb is living that life. He became a firefighter at 21 and went to work alongside his dad at the Chicago Fire Department. Before his father retired, the pair even went out on a call together -- father supervising  son.
""You know, it's everything for me to watch you grow,"" his father says. But he also recalls worrying about one particular fire that his son faced.
""I received a phone call that night. And they said, 'Well, your son was at this fire.' I said, 'OK, which way is this conversation going to go?' "" Dekalb Walcott Jr. recalls.
""And they said, 'But he's OK. And he put it out all by himself. Everybody here was proud of him.'
""And the word went around, 'Who was out there managing that fire? Oh, that's Walcott! That's Walcott up there!' So, you know, moments like that, it's heaven on Earth for a dad.""
Dekalb Walcott Jr. retired in 2009. The younger Dekalb says he's proud of being a second-generation firefighter. ""You know, it makes me look forward to fatherhood as well, because I'm definitely looking forward to passing that torch down to my son.""",high9234.txt
