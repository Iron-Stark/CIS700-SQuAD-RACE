It was ""A Street in Bronzeville"" that gained the attention of literary experts in 1945. Critics praised her poetic skills and her powerful descriptions about the black experience during the time. The Bronzeville poems were her first published collection.

""Annie Allen"" is a collection of poetry about a Bronzeville girl as a daughter, a wife and a mother. She experiences loneliness, loss, death andpoverty .
Gwendolyn Brooks said that winning the prize changed her life.

Its main ideas about the difficult lives of many women are popular among female writers today.",high1172.txt
