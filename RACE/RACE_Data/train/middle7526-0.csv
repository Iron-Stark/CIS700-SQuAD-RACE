0,A,"['Industry', 'Health', 'Clean air', 'The future of the children']","According to the passage, what does man believe to be the most important?","Our environment is being polluted faster. Man's present efforts cannot prevent it .Time is bringing us more people, and more people will bring us more industry, more cars, larger cities and the growing use of man-made materials.
What can explain and solve this problem ?The fact is that pollution is caused by man ----by his desire  for a modern way of life. We make ""industrialization ""our main aim. So we seem to be ready to give up everything: clear air, pure water, good food, our health and the future of our children. Large numbers of people are moving from the countryside into the cities, looking forward to the modern life. But as our world has developed so fast in the last twenty years, pollution has become a serious problem.
Isn't it time for us to stop to ask ourselves where we are going-----and why? It makes one think of the story about the airline pilot who was heard over the loudspeaker, ""I've some good news and some bad news. The good news is that we're flying at 530 miles per hour. The bad news is that we're lost and don't know where we're going."" The sad fact is that this becomes a true story when we talk about our modern society.",middle7526.txt
