2,C,"['Angry.', 'Relaxed.', 'Regretful.', 'Excited.']",What did the author feel after having his driving license taken away?,"In most cases, drivers lose their driving licenses because they drink and drive. I have always promised myself that I will never drive if I have drunk alcohol .
  Still, half a year ago, I made a terrible mistake and drove after having drunk two beers at my friend's while watching a football match. I then drove my car to take another friend to his place. I thought there would be no problem because it was night and there would be no policemen on my way. But to my surprise, a policeman stopped me. I was not allowed to drive for three months and I also had to pay a fine. I told my parents nothing at the beginning, but then I had to invent a lie because I did not have the courage to tell them that I had driven after drinking and  _ was the real reason why my driving license was taken away.
  Those three months seemed to pass very slowly for me because I was used to driving almost daily and I really needed my car quite often. I had to take a taxi and it cost me a lot of money. Then there were times when I had to ask a friend to take me to some place or another, especially if I wanted to go out of town. It was indeed a punishment for me not to have my driving license and I promised myself not to repeat this mistake again.
  Apart from this, being drunk while driving represents a real danger not only for the driver, but also for people in the car and for people on the street or in other cars. Therefore, I advise people to avoid drinking alcohol before driving.",high23267.txt
