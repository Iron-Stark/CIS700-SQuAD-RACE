0,C,"['played the piano with Pasha for the first time', 'listened to Pasha tell her story about the princess', 'remembered happier times of writing stories and acting them out', ""discovered that Mrs. Windsor's niece would be giving the piano lesson""]",Jennifer got lost in thought when she   _,"When I heard the piano, I walked to Mrs. Windsor's house and waited outside as I always did. That meant she was working with another student, and I was not supposed to bother them by ringing the bell. I stood against the wall and daydreamed what I'd rather be doing. ""Almost anything"", I sighed _ . I had been tutored enough to read, understand, and even write some musical compositions, but I just didn't have a gift for it. It didn't come to me naturally. I thought back to happier times when I was writing stories and acting them out with my friends, cutting up old clothes to make dresses that performers wear in plays, and building scenery out of old things we found. But Mrs. Windsor had offered to give me the lessons for free, so I felt my duty to try.
The door opened and Wendy Barton came out. I walked in, sat down on the piano bench and began to sort through my sheet music.
""Hello,"" I heard a voice behind me say softly. I turned around to see a little girl standing behind me, eating an apple. But before I could make any response, Mrs. Windsor walked into the room in her usual urgent manner and announced,""Jennifer, this is my niece, Pasha. Pasha, this is Jennifer. Pasha will be giving you your lesson today. I'm up to my ears in something else!"" she then exited to the kitchen.
Pasha set her apple down on the side table and slid beside me on the piano bench.
""What piece do you like best?""she asked.
""What do you mean?"" I asked. ""They're all the same to me. I don't know.
""You mean you don't have a favorite?""
""No, not really.""
Pasha looked at me, rather puzzled, then opened my sheet music to the beginning page and asked me to play. I arranged my fingers on the keys and studied the notes on the page for a moment. Then I frowned and concentrated to make the notes on the page match the finger movements. I have to admit I was a rather mechanical pianist.
After about a page or two, Pasha gently put her hand on top of mine as if to calm my fingers. There was a long pause. ""What are you hearing in the music?"" I looked at her rather strangely and admitted I didn't know what she meant.
""Like a story. What story is being playing out within the music?""
""I guess I've never thought about it before. I don't know.""
""Here, let me try and you listen,"" Pasha advised.
She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, letting her fingers dance lightly over the keys. Then, she began to play. ""See, it begins here beside some kind of river. Hear the water flowing beside you?""
Her fingers rose and fell gently on the keys.""Now the princess appears and she's picking flowers from the water's edge.""A carefree, happy piece of music filled the air in time to Pasha's dancing fingers. ""Oh, but she slips!""The music changed. ""And our princess is being carried off by the fast-flowing stream. Quickly, the princess's horse sees her plight  ,"" Pasha continued, and races to the river's edge where he swims out to let her catch hold of him. They make it to the bank and she hugs her faithful horse and swears she will never again wear princess skirts that weigh her down. She will only wear jeans and T-shirt from now on."" Pasha finished with a big smile and then looked at me.
""Aren't you the girl who tells the stories?"" she asked.
""I guess. I do tell a lot of stories.""
""Oh, yes! All the kids talk about them. I've heard about you. Well, all you have to do is learn to hear the stories in the music. That's all there is to it.""
""I've never thought it that way.""
""Let's try another one, shall we?""Pasha smiled and together we played that afternoon, finding the stories in the music and learning that sometimes it takes a friend to pull you out of the river onto dry land again.",high8125.txt
