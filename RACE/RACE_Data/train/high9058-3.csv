3,D,"['Mozilla.', 'Spreadtrum.', 'Samsung.', 'Carolina Milanesi.']",Which of the following held a negative attitude towards the cheap smart phone?,"Mozilla has shown off a prototype  for a $25 (PS15) smart phone that is aimed at the developing world.
The company, which is famed mostly for its Firefox browser , has partnered with the Chinese low-cost chip maker Spreadtrum.
While not as powerful as more expensive models, the phone will run apps and make use of mobile internet.
It would appeal to the sorts of people who currently buy cheap ""feature"" phones, analysts said.
Feature phones are highly popular in the developing world as a halfway point between ""dumb"" phones --- just voice calls and other basic functions --- and fully-developed smart phones.
Mozilla hopes that it will take an early lead in a market that is now being targeted by mobile phone producers who see the developing world as the remaining area for massive growth.
It will face fierce competition from bigger, more popular brands, however --- with more announcements of this kind expected over the course of the next couple of days at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
""These solutions expand the global accessibility of open web smart phones to first-time and entry-level smart phone buyers by reducing the time and cost required for handset makers to bring these phones to market,"" said Spreadtrum in a press statement.
Mozilla said the phone ""redefines""  the entry-level phone market.
The concept of a cheap smart phone may seem likely to appeal to consumers in developed countries, particularly those who locked into long contracts in order to pay part of the cost of the likes of the Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy range.
But analyst Carolina Milanesi, from Kantar World panel, said it should not be seen as a competitor.",high9058.txt
