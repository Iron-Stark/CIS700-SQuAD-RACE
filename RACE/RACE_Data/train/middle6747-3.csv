3,A,"['She plays basketball at school.', 'She plays the violin at school.', 'She goes shopping with her parents.', 'She watches TV at home.']",What does Alice do on Tuesday afternoon?,"Dear Jenny,
How are you? Thanks for your last letter.
I like English and Maths, too. I think they're interesting and useful . Our school is over at 3:40 p. m. every day and I can get home at 4 o'clock, but I don't go home at once .
On Monday afternoon, I have a violin lesson from 4:00 to 5:00. I like sports, and I'm in the school basketball team with our P. E. teacher on Tuesday afternoon. On Wednesday afternoon, I go shopping with my parents. We buy a lot of food and fruits, and I like eating them very much. On Thursday, I often watch TV at home after school. I like Sports World very much
On Saturday we don't have classes. I often sing in an art school. I like singing and I can sing better now. I usually go to the park or have a rest at home on Sunday. I'm busy every day, but I'm very happy because I have fun in my life.
Yours,
Alice",middle6747.txt
