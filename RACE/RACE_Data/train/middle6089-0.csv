0,D,"['One.', 'Two.', 'Three.', 'Four.']",How many tips does the writer give us?,"A life coach   is somebody who helps you reach all kinds of personal and professional goals  . Each of us has the ability to be our own life coach. Here are some tips for you:
 Pay attention to your relationships with others.
Ask yourself the following questions: What do you do with disagreements? When was the last time you showed your family members that you care for them? Your relationships with friends, family members and teachers show a lot about the kind of person you are.
 Face the fears about the future.
Now, imagine that one of your good friends told you that he or she was not strong enough to go back to school. We often give better advice than we are willing to take ourselves. Remember that even the most successful people were probably told that what they wanted to do was impossible, but they followed their dreams and succeeded.
 Develop your talents.
If you want to reach your goals, you will have to spend more time developing the talents you already have, and uncovering any hidden talents that you haven't discovered yet. So you can take classes in subjects that you are interested in, even if you have no experience.
 Be thankful  .
Take some time to be thankful for the things you do have. Remember positive   memories. Think of the best day(s) you have had in the past month or year. Remember special parties, vacations and holidays. Be thankful to the wonderful people you have in your life.",middle6089.txt
