Before I was out of primary school,mother could see I lacked the gifts for either making millions or winning the love of crowds.So she began pushing me toward working with words. _ .There seemed to be a word gene that passed down from her mother's grandfather*
The greatest proof was my mother's first cousin Edwin.He was the managing editor of the New York Times and had gained a name in his career.
In 1947 1 graduated from Johns Hopkins and applied for a job with the Baltimore Sun as a police reporter.It paid$30 a week .When I complained the wage was shameful for a learned man,mother refused to sympathize.""If you work hard at this job,""she said,""maybe you can make something of it.""
After a while,I was asked to cover diplomats at various African embassies. Then,
