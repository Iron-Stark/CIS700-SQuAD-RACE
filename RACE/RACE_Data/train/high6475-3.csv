3,B,"['Because she is too old to remember them.', 'Because the children have grown up and have their own interests.', 'Because she has put too many things in the basement.', ""Because she doesn't like the children any longer.""]",Why did the author forget the Surprise Travel Bags?,""" Yeah! Auntie is here! "" screamed my husband's niece and nephew together. "" Let me get the door!"" "" No, let me !"" Each one's goal was to get there first and open the door for their Auntie, Me!
I couldn't get enough of them, of their youthful love of life, and their excitement every time I visited! To be honest, it was partially because of the Surprise Travel Bag that I carried in. It was a tradition that I started when they were young. Each time I went to see them, I would take a large bag filled with toys, coloring books, candy, magic markers and ""games"".
The contents  were different but the rules were not. They included: one may get a turn to choose what activity we would do; another may take a turn to go first when we played a game; ..... We shared the treats after the games and cleaned up after we played . Then, sadly, they watched the Surprise Travel Bag go away with their Auntie.
Now my niece and nephew have grown into young adults. They spend most of their visits listening to their iPods, messaging on their phones.... I completely forgot that I had put my two Surprise Travel Bags in the basement  until my husband found them this weekend.
I held the bags tightly in my arms, remembering our laughter and fun-filled get-togethers. My big decision now is to whom I will pass the Surprise Travel Bags so that the fun that the bags help to create can continue.",high6475.txt
