2,C,"['means the same in American as in England', 'means ""call somebody"" to the old man', 'has two different means in America and in England', 'means ""be going to get married"" in England']","From this passage we can see that ""give somebody a ring'  _  .","When I was 16 years old,I made my first visit to the United States.It wasn't the first time I had been abroad.Like most English children I also learned French at school.And I had often been to France,so I was used to speaking a foreign language to people who didn't understand English.But when I went to America I was really looking forward to having a nice easy holiday without any language problems.
How wrong I was! The misunderstanding began at the airport.I was looking for a public telephone to give my friend Danny a call and tell her that I had arrived.A friendly old man saw me looking lost and asked if he could help me.
""Yes,""I said.""I want to give my friend a ring."" 
""Well,that's nice,""he said.""Are you getting married? But aren't you a bit young?""
""Who is talking about marriage?""I replied.""I only want to give my friend a ring to tell  her I've arrived.Can you tell me where there's a phone box?""
""Oh!""he said,""there's a phone downstairs.""
When at last we met,Danny explained the misunderstanding to me.
""Don't worry,""she said to me,""I had so many difficulties at first.There are lots of words Which the Americans use differently in meaning from British.You will soon get used to all! How funny things they say.Most of the time British and American people understand each other!''",high16629.txt
