4,A,"['Three.', 'Two.', 'One', 'Many.']",How many people are there in the story?,"Tom and Simon were Americans. Once they visited Spain. One day they came into a little restaurant for lunch. They did not know Spanish , and the waiter did not know their American English, either. They wanted the waiter to understand that they needed some milk and eggs. At first Tom read the word ""milk""many times. Then Simon spelled it on the table. But the waiter could not understand them at all. At last Tom took out of a piece  paper and began to draw a cow. The waiter looked at it and ran out of   the restaurant.
""How clever you are!"" Simon said to Tom, ""He understood us at last!"" After some time, the waiter came back, he brought no milk with him, but two tickets for a bull-fight  down on their table!",middle5703.txt
