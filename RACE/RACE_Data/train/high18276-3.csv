3,D,"['A team at Sydney University developed a robot.', 'Using robots on farms can reduce injuries.', 'Dairy farming in Australia needs transforming.', 'Robot used to round up cows is a hit with farmers.']",What's the main idea of the text?,"A four-wheeled robot,known as Rover,has been tested by a team at Sydney University.It was used to move a herd of cows from a field to a dairy .
Researchers were amazed at how easily cows accepted the presence of the robot.They were not disturbed by it and the gathering process was calm and effective.Because the robot moved in a steady manner it allowed cows to move at their own speed,which was important in reducing injuries among cattle,said Dr Kendra Kerrisk,dairy researcher and associate professor.
The robot was adapted from one that was already being used to monitor fruit and trees on farms.A team at Sydney University's Centre for Field Robotics improved the robot so that it could be put in a field with cows in order for the researchers to gather data on robot--cow interaction.
The robot needs to be operated by a human but it's hoped that in the future a version can be developed that will be fully automated.As well as gathering cows a new version could also collect information useful for farmers.
Using robots to get cows to the dairy will be better for their well-being.""The research is in its very early stages but robotic technologies certainly have the potential to transform dairy farming,""said Dr.Kerrisk.""When we have discussed this concept with farmers they have been extremely excited and we have had a series of calls and emails asking how they can get hold of one,""she added.
The robot could also cut down the number of accidents involving humans on farms.Most dairy farmers in Australia use bikes to round up their cattle and they are one of the leading causes of injury.The team hopes that by using the robot to do the job instead,accident rates could fall.",high18276.txt
