3,D,"['To be No.1.', ""Let's compare."", 'A volunteering job.', 'Running your own race.']",What is the best title of the passage?,"Think back to a time in your life when you tried something new.
When I was a teenager I volunteered to pass out water at a local race. I was so excited to see all the different runners who passed by and quickly took a cup of water. Some ran past, some walked past and a few wheeled past.[:ZXXK]
I saw so many types of people doing it. I thought maybe I could do it too! The next year I decided to run for the race, but I had little running practice. I just wanted to finish. On the day of the race, it was terribly hot. After running for about 5 miles, I was thinking, ""I must be crazy. Why did I do this? What was I thinking?"" And at one moment, I said to myself, ""I am never doing this again!""
That first 10 km race was quite an experience. I jogged, I walked, I jogged and walked. At times, I didn't know if I could finish.
Near the end, a 70-year-old man ran past me, very fast, and I felt a little embarrassed   that I was more than 50 years younger than he and I couldn't even keep up with him. But then I realized something. He was running his race and I was running mine. How often in life do we compare  ourselves to others when we really shouldn't? I decided that I would not give up on running races,and that one day I would be one of those 70yearolds who were still running.
As I crossed the finishing line, I was proud of myself. I didn't regret   having such an experience.",middle6737.txt
