Beginning this fall, a number of courses developed by teachers at both universities will be offered online through a new $60 million program, known as edX. ""Anyone with an Internet connection anywhere in the world can use our online courses,"" Harvard President Drew Faust said during a meeting to announce the plan.
MIT has offered a program called OpenCourseWare for ten years that makes materials from more than 2,000 classes free online. It has been used by more than 100 million people. In December, the school announced it also would begin offering a special certificate, known as MITx, for people who complete certain online courses. Harvard has long offered courses to a wider population through a similar program.
The MITx will serve as the foundation for the new learning platform.
MIT President Susan Hockfield said more than 120,000 people signed up for the first MITx course. She said Harvard and MIT hope other universities will join them in offering courses on the open-source edX platform.

They also plan to use the edX platform to research how students learn and which teaching methods and tools are most successful.",high370.txt
