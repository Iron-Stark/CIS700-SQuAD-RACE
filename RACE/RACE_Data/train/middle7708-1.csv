1,A,"[""Their parents don't make breakfast for them."", 'They would like to study well.', 'They get up early.', ""They don't like eating breakfast.""]",Why did the students go to school without breakfast?,"I think all of us should know it's necessary to have breakfast. It's one of the most important meals of the day. If you want to keep fit, you should have a good breakfast. Choosing the right food is also important. For it, you may have bread, eggs and milk.
But in fact, many students go to school without breakfast. This does harm to their health. Maybe they say they have no time because it's too late or their parents are too busy to prepare breakfast for them.
What will happen to the students on an empty stomach ? Because of no energy, they can't keep active. They may not grow fast. When they feel hungry, they are not able to study well and they have no energy to play well, either. What's worse , they will spend more time getting better once they fall ill.
Therefore , we shouldn't go to school without breakfast, no matter what reason it is.",middle7708.txt
