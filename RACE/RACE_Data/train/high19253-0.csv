""Let's just give it a try,"" my fiancee said. I was a bit nervous, but I knew some of our friends were already into it, and they said it was fine and that I should relax because everyone was doing it.""OK,"" I agreed, convinced it would be harmless.

Before long, we were using it once a week. Then it became twice a week. We went from using it after work to using it in the mornings, and then at lunchtime, too.
Suddenly we reached a point where we were using it every day. Even when I wasn't using it, I was thinking about using it.  _ C _ 
That's when I realized the terrible truth. We couldn't stop.
Dear readers, it shames me to admit it, but I am an addict of online shopping site Taobao.
And I don't think I'm the only one.  _ D _ 
I see the telltale signs every where: People with bags under their eyes, clearly exhausted after staying up late browsing items they might one day need (but probably won't),like the 1940s leather aviator cap I bought in the event I ever need to become an aviator in the 1940s. I see co-workers furtively  sneaking down to the mailroom, eyes darting around suspiciously.
I know what's going through your mind as you read this.
""This isn't me,"" you're thinking, ""I can stop anytime I want.""

In China you can get same day delivery for just about anything you buy online. In Australia, my home country, the same item would take weeks to arrive.
""It's the convenience,"" I said to my fiancee. ""That's why we're hooked.""
But is that convenience worth the risk of waking up one morning to discover you've been buried alive in masses of brand new women's shoes?
In my case it's probably not, especially because I suspect my fiancee won't realize I'm missing until weeks later, when my credit card stops working and I've long since expired.
So what can you do to battle this terrible addiction?
Never fear, dear readers, because I've created a special five-step list to help you stop online shopping.
Step one: Acknowledge you have a problem. Resist buying adult-sized, Star Wars Stormtrooper outfit on Taobao. You don't really need it.
Step two: Try not to feel guilty about buying adult-sized, Star Wars Stormtrooper outfit on Taobao.
Step three: Put the computer and smartphone away, get back to nature, and take a walk in the park.
Step four: Try not to feel guilty about buying a new outfit for your walk in the park. I mean, it was  on sale, right?
Step five: Buying a book on how to quit Taobao...from Taobao.
On second thoughts, maybe don't listen to me, after all.",high19253.txt
