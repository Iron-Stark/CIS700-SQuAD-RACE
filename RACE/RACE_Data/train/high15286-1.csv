1,D,"['see how famous he was there', 'enjoy the delicious food there', 'enjoy the beautiful views there', 'see what would happen if no one knew him']",The famous man took his sister to another country to   _  .,"Once upon a time, there was a man who was so famous that everyone in his country knew him.
One day, the famous man was sitting in a restaurant with his sister. ""It must be great to be famous. Everyone tries to please you, and you can do whatever you want to,"" said his sister. ""It's quite the opposite sometimes, in fact. Because I'm famous, I can't do what I want to,"" he denied. ""But look, we're sitting at the best table and eating the best food. We couldn't sit here and eat this if you weren't famous,"" said his sister. ""I'll show you what I mean,"" said he.
The next day, the famous man picked up his sister and took her to another country. ""I'm not at all famous here,"" he said. ""Let's see how we get on."" Soon they found a restaurant, but it was very busy, so they had to queue. ""This wouldn't have happened if you were famous,"" said his sister, but the famous man just smiled.
When they finally got a table, it took the waiter years to bring what they ordered. And the food supposed to be hot was cold, and the food supposed to be cold was hot! Eventually, the famous man couldn't stand any more and asked to see the manager. ""This food is awful. We had to wait an hour for a seat, and the service is also very poor. Look, even my spoon is dirty!""
Showing his horribly yellow teeth, the manager, smiling, said, ""Well, that's just bad luck for you.""
""Don't you know who I am?"" asked the famous man.
""I've no idea,"" replied the manager.
So the famous man and his sister ran away, without paying.",high15286.txt
