My name is Winnie. I'm a 15-year-old girl. I live in the beautiful city of Rizhao.
I'm an active , lovely and clever girl. In the school my favourite subject is Math. Maybe someone thinks it's difficult to study well. But I like it. I believe  that if you try your best, everything can be done well.
I also like sports very much, such as running, volleyball and so on.
I'm kind. If you need help, please come to me.
I hope we can be good friends!
OK. This is me, a sunny girl!",middle4356.txt
