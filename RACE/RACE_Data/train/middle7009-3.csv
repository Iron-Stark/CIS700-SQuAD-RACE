3,A,"['The Spirit of Giving.', 'A terrible earthquake.', 'The way of helping others.', 'A family story']",What's the best title of this passage?,"When an earthquake hit a small town,many houses fell down.After the earthquake,all the newspapers reported many stories about some of the families in trouble.
One Sunday, when I was reading a newspaper, a special picture touched me.It gave the clothing sizes of each family member.I thought that this would be a good chance to teach my children to help those who were less lucky than themselves.I said to my seven-year-old twins,Brad and Brett,and three-year-old Meghan.""We have so much,and these poor people now have nothing.We'll share what we have with them.""
I filled a box with food and clothes.While I was doing this,I encouraged the boys to choose their toys and donate some of their less favourite things.Meghan watched quietly as the boys took out their old toys and games and put them together.Then she walked away.A few minutes later she came back with Lucy, her much-loved doll.She put the doll on top of the other toys.""Oh,dear"" I said.""You don't have to give Lucy.You love her so much.""Meghan said,""Lucy makes me happy,Mommy.Maybe she'll make another little girl happy, too.""I looked at Meghan for a long moment.She taught me a lesson.It's easy to give something that we don't want any more,but harder to give what we cherish ,isn't?",middle7009.txt
