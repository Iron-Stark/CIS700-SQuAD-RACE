0,C,"['care about fashion very much', 'are from the same country', 'care about important events in the world', ""don't 1ike new things""]",The author's grandfathers   _  .,"Grandparents are important people in everyone's life.They are those people who take care of you and love you. They are special persons who can give you wise advice.
My grandparents always teach me to respect others,and they show me that love and feelings are important things in life and that we shouldn't pay much attention to material things or what people look like.
My grandparents show a mixture of cultures and nationalities because they come from different countries.For example,my grandfather on my mother's side is from Spain,and my grandmother is also from Spain,but from a different city.On my father's side,my grandfather is from Venezuela,and my grandmother is from Italy.A1though they are from different countries,my grandparents have a very good relationship.
What's more,my grandparents are people that always keep in touch with the new things in the world. For example,my grandmothers always care about fashion,how they dress and their personal appearance. And my grandfathers always care about the important events in the world.
I think I am very lucky that all of my grandparents are alive because I have learned so much from them,I would like to continue learning from them even though we are living in different countries now.I will always remember my grandparents as role models for me.",high8257.txt
