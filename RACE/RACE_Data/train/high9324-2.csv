2,C,"['All of them', 'Half of them', 'None of them', 'Most of them']",Which of the requirements mentioned by the Smiths do you think Cassy can meet?,"Dear Cassy,
Thanks for reminding me by e-mail that you want to baby-sit our children. Although you are only 12 years old, my wife and I would be willing to consider your application if you can meet  a few requirements:
1)Send us three letters from teachers who will prove that you have never failed to follow instructions perfectly in class and never failed to hand in your homework on time.
2)Send us a note from two doctors who will prove that you are in perfect health, have never been sick, and never will be sick.
3)Send us a document from your physical education teacher or team coach that proves that you can do each of the following: Run two miles in less than four minutes, climb an oiled rope to a height of twenty feet in thirty seconds while balancing a glass of water on your nose, and walk in bare feet over hot coals and broken glass without injury.
4)Send us notarized letters from at least two mental health experts saying that you have never had an envious thought towards other people.
5)Play and defeat five expert chess players while blindfolded after going without sleep for 48 hours.
6)Wait patiently for two years while we have investigators certify that all your documents are real.
Your loving and trusting friends,
The Smiths",high9324.txt
