1,A,"['because they are unfamiliar with the American tip system .', 'because they are too mean to give tips to any waiter.', 'because they have difficulty communicating with waiters.', 'because they are not really easy to become satisfied.']",Why don't some foreigners tip a waiter according to the writer?.,"When I worked as a waitress in Chicago, US, my coworkers and I would sigh whenever we heard someone with a foreign accent coming into our restaurant. We knew what it meant to serve a non-American: no tip. We would work just as hard as we always did, but we might not get paid.
Americans have an unspoken rule about tipping: they give tips to almost everyone who offers them a service of some kind. Americans tip their waiters, barbers and taxi drivers. An appropriate tip is between 15 and 20 percent of the amount charged for the service (But the charge for the tip doesn't appear on the bill. The customer is expected to add it himself/herself.) Tipping less than this sends a message to your waiters that you think they've done a bad job serving you. And to leave no tip at all is simply unacceptable.
It's not that American waiters are greedy. In many countries, waiters are paid a salary for their work. They'll earn money even if no one comes into the restaurant. This system offers much more safety for waiters than the American version. In the US, waiters know that a night without customers means a night without pay.
Some countries include a tip for waiters - a ""service charge"" - on the bill itself. Since the tip is included with the other charges, waiters don't need to worry about people forgetting to tip. But in the US, waiters do not receive a salary, and service charges only appear on bills when there are six or more customers at the table.
Since almost all American customers are familiar with the system, they know to add a tip without being told. But visitors to the US may expect waiters to be paid a salary, or think that the tip is included on the bill.
So much as we waiters loved hearing stories about other places from our foreign customers, we were always nervous when they got ready to leave the restaurant. We were never sure what to expect.",high2313.txt
