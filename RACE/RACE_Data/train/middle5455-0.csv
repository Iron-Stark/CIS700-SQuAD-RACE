I've been working at Burger Bam for two months.I thought I'd hate it,but it's been really good.I've learned a lot how to work with people I would never normally meet.And I'm not as shy as I was.I don't think I want to work there forever,but it's given me some ideas about how to run a business.Maybe I'll learn business when I go to college.

I've had my own web design business for a year. I've designed about 20 websites for my friends.I've been doing most of the work on the weekends after I do my homework! I've bought a new computer with the money I earned. A little restaurants in my neighborhood has asked me to design a website for them, so my business is growing. I'm not sure what I want to do in the future, but I really like art and design. Maybe I should go into advertising.

I've been volunteering at a senior citizen center on Saturday mornings. Some of my friends think I'm crazy, doing a job for no money, but I really like it. I think that in a few months, I'll try to get a paid part-time job in a law office because I want to study law in the future. There's a lot of competition for part-time jobs, but I think my volunteering will look good on my resume.
