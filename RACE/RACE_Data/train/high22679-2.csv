2,C,"[""The patient will be in danger if he's taken as much as a full spoon."", ""The doctor will be in trouble if he's given the patient a full spoon."", 'Since one spoon is less than five drops, the patient will be all right soon if he takes only one full spoon at a time.', 'If the patient wants to remain safe, he should take no more than five drops at a time.']",Which of the following is NOT true?,"There was once a professor of medicine, who was very strict with the students. Whenever he took the chair on the exam committee, the students would be in fear, because he was seldom pleased with the answers they gave. A student would be lucky enough if he or she could receive a good mark from him. At the end of the term, the students of medicine would take their exam again. Now a student was a little nervous as he knew it would not be so easy to get through the exam at all.
The professor began to ask. The student was required to describe a certain illness, his description of which turned out to be OK. 
Then the professor asked about the cure for illness, and the student, too, answered just as right.
 ""Good,"" said the professor, ""and how much will you give the patient?""
 ""A full spoon,"" answered the student. 
 ""Now you may go out and wait for what you can get,"" said the professor. At the same time the committee discussed carefully the answers the student had given. Suddenly the student noticed that there was something wrong with his last answer. ""A full spoon is too much,"" he thought to himself. Anxiously he opened the door of the room and cried, ""Mr Professor, I've made a mistake! A full spoon is too much for the patient. He can take only five drops.""
 ""I'm sorry, sir,"" said the professor coldly, ""But it is too late. Your patient has died.""",high22679.txt
