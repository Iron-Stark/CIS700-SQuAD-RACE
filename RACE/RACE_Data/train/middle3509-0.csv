0,D,"['Frank and His Work', 'One Piano Only', 'The Man and the Girl', 'Easy Work and More Money']",Which is the best title for the passage?,"Frank was clever, but he never liked to work hard. He often said to his friends, ""If you work hard, you will make a lot of money, but it is not so good. I want easy work and a lot of money. That's the most interesting thing in the world.""So he could only be a thief. But he still thought it was too much work, so he only told his friends what to do and got money from them.
One day, Frank sent one of his friends to a very large and beautiful house. He told him to get money from that rich family. It was evening, and a man and a girl were in the room. They were playing a duet on a piano. Then the thief came into the house.
When he returned, Frank asked him what he had got. But he said, ""I didn't take anything. That family can't have much money. You know, two people were playing on the same piano there. They did not have money to buy another piano.""",middle3509.txt
