One of the best ways to practice your English is to speak to a foreigner. You may ask, ""Is it okay to try to talk to foreigners I see in the street?""
The answer is yes and no, but probably no! If you see a foreigner who looks lost, it is polite to ask him, ""May I help you?"" But, otherwise, you should probably let them get on with their business. Situations, however, do exist where it is quite all right to talk to foreigners. If a foreigner enters your school, classroom, office, shop or restaurant, for instance, feel free to ask him (for example):
-- What is your name?
-- Where do you come from?
-- What do you think of Beijing?
-- How long will you stay in Beijing?
There are also situations where it's okay to talk to foreigners in public places. If you see a foreigner alone in a restaurant, bar or coffee shop, it may be appropriate to ask him or her:
-- Is this seat free?
-- Do you mind if I talk to you in English?
You can probably help them if they are new in China and if they are alone, you may be able to make them feel more welcome.
After a few such questions, you should know whether this person wants to talk to you or not. If they ask you similar questions, or if they give long, informative answers, you're in luck. If not, then give them their privacy. Talking to strangers is fun if you choose the right time and place.",high17602.txt
