3,C,"['after supper they started to go down.', 'they got to the tour hotel the next day', 'Nancy sent some postcards to Wu Tong', 'Nancy had a great time in Mount Tai']",From the letter we may know   _  .,"Dear Nancy,
How are you? Now I want to tell something interesting. Last week we had a trip to Mount Tai. On Tuesday we went to Taian by bus, a city at the foot of the mountain. We had a good rest at a hotel. At about one o'clock early the next morning, we began to climb the mountain. It took us about four hours and a half to get to the top. The mountain is covered   with trees. I didn't see such a beautiful place before.
""Look! The sun is going to rise!"" my friend Lim shouted.
We all turned to the east and watched. Soon half of the sky because white, and a big, red ball was rising slowly. A few minutes later, the sky became bright .
We stayed on the top and had a good time. After lunch we started going down. We got to the tour hotel at about four in the afternoon. Though we were tired, we were very happy. We came back to school the next day.
Thank you very much for your last letter and the beautiful postcards. Hope to hear from you soon.
Yours
Wu Tong",middle419.txt
