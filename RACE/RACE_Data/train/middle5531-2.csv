2,D,"['people spend less time reading than writing', 'you should try to understand each word when you listen', 'we can remember what we hear for a long time', ""you'd better leave your worries and problems behind when you listen""]",From the passage we know that   _  .,"Most people think talking is the most important communication skill.They care little about listening.A research about our waking day communicating time shows that 9% is spent writing, 16% reading, 30% talking and 45% listening.
Many of us can remember only 50% immediately after hearing something.But within two to eight weeks, we can only remember 25% or less of the message.Sometimes it will make us fail if we really forget something important.
Here are some suggestions to be a good listener.
Stop talking -- you can't listen well when you speak.
Ask questions -- when you don't understand, when you want to catch their attention or when you want to be liked.
Be polite -- give them time to say what they have to say.
Listen carefully and actively to what they are saying -- pay attention to their words, their ideas and their feelings as those things relate to the subjects.
Understand the main points.
Look at each other -- you will feel confident by looking.
Don't argue with other people when you are trying to understand them, especially when they are speaking.
Try not to bring your worries and problems -- when you listen, they will stop you from listening well.
Learn to listen and you'll achieve a great success in your life.",middle5531.txt
