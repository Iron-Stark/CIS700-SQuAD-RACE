2,D,"['Because he wanted to give a lecture about money.', 'Because he was used to dropping a bill on the floor and stepping on it.', 'Because he was going to give the bill to one of the students.', 'Because he wanted to make the students know what the value was.']",Why did the famous teacher use a PS100 at his lesson?,"A famous teacher was speaking to the students at our school. He began his lesson by holding up a PS100 bill. Then he said to the three hundred students, ""Who would like to have this PS100 bill?"" The students began to put up their hands at once.
Then he said, ""I am going to give this bill to one of you, but first, let me do this."" He then made this bill into a ball. Then he said, ""Who wants it?"" Hands went into the air.
""Well,"" he said, ""What if I do this?"" and he dropped it on the floor and stepped on it. He picked up the dirty, crumpled bill and said, ""Who still wants it?"" _ 
""My friends,"" he said, ""You've learned a valued lesson today. No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it because it didn't go down in value. It was still worth PS100.
Many times in our lives, we're dropped, crumpled, and stepped on by the chances we take and the things that happen to us. We feel as if we are worth nothing. But remember, no matter what has happened to you, you will never lose your value. You are always valuable to those who love you. Your value doesn't come from what you drop or whom you know,but WHO YOU ARE .
You are special and valuable. Don't ever forget it!",high539.txt
