2,D,"['to make great achievements, you must lose everything', 'people should try to achieve everything regardless of death', 'people who will be dead soon must make big choices in life', 'in the face of death, nothing is truly important except to follow your dream']","In Jobs's speech in Stanford, we can learn that  _  .","Apple Inc co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs, counted among the greatest American CEOs of his generation, died on Wednesday at the age of 56, after a-year-long and highly public battle with cancer. Jobs' death was announced by Apple in a statement late on Wednesday. The Apple.com homepage featured a black-and-white picture of him with the words ""Steve Jobs, 1955-2011"".
A message on the site read, ""Apple has lost an imaginary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring leader.""
""His greatest love was for his wife, Laurene, and his family. Our hearts go out to them and to all who were touched by his extraordinary gifts.""
""Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple."" The Silicon Valley hero who gave the world the iPod and the iPhone had resigned as CEO of the world's largest technology corporation in August, handing the position to current chief executive Tim Cook.
Two years before the iPhone that forever transformed the way people around the world access and use the Internet, Jobs talked about how a sense of his death was a major driver behind that vision.
""Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever got to help me make the big choices in life,"" Jobs said during a Stanford commencement ceremony in 2005. ""Because almost everything-all others' expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure-these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.""
""Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.""",high15309.txt
