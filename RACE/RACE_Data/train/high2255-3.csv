3,B,"['A climate with no rain will form around the hotel.', 'The material can protect the hotel from bad weather.', 'A power station will be built in the hotel.', 'Bricks will be used as the materials instead of glass.']",What characteristics will the new hotel have?,"The rising sea waters caused by global warming have inspired a Russian architect to design a hotel that could be built on water as well as land.The eco-friendly ""Ark"" could be constructed in just a few months anywhere in the world, the designer says.
It's called ""The Ark"",but looks more like a ship sitting upside down on the water.A new design by Russian architect A1exander Remizov challenges the tradition of land-based hotel and would provide a shelter in the future--should the world face a modern-day flood as described in the Bible.
The building of the hotel could be fast and simple.""Prefabricated section could be put together in three to four months,"" Remizov said. The versatile structure could be constructed in most corners of the earth, even in earthquake-prone areas.Constructing ""The Ark""--which would include 14 000 square meters of living space---would cost roughly the same as building an energy-efficient house. The self-supporting structure would be built around a central post, connecting wind generators and heat pumps on its roof with the basement,where solar,wind,and thermal energy could be stored and turned into electricity. Remizov has designed the building without glass,choosing instead the lasting and self-cleaning foil that could defend itself against rough weather conditions.That foil would be fastened to metals,which would also collect rainwater.The building would also feature an indoor jungle, creating its microclimate.",high2255.txt
