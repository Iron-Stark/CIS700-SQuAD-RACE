0,A,"['To smoke fish, you have to salt the fish first.', 'Smoked fish can only be kept in a basket.', ""You'd better use dried wood to smoke fish."", 'Smoked fish taste better than dried fish.']",What can we infer from the passage?,"Today we have the second report explaining how to prepare fish by drying or smoking them. We talked last week about the first steps of cleaning and salting freshly caught fish.
To dry fish, you will need either a drying table or a place to hang them. If a table is used, it should have a top made of wire screen or thin pieces of wood with space between each piece. 
Lay the cleaned, wet salted fish on top of the table. Do not let them touch each other. Be sure that air can reach the fish from all sides. 
     _ Turn the fish over every other day. Small fish will dry in about three days if the air is dry. Large fish will take a week or ten days to dry.
After the fish have dried, place them in a basket. Cover them with clean paper or large leaves. Then put the basket in a cool, dry place off the ground. 
Make sure as much of the saltwater as possible is removed before you smoke the fish.
The smoking can be done in a large, round metal container. Remove the top of the drum and cut a small opening on one side at the bottom.
Cover the top with a strong wire screen, where you put the fish. Build a small fire in the drum by reaching in through the opening at the bottom. 
Wood from fruit trees makes good fuel for your fire.  _ will give the smoked fish good color1 and taste. One way to get a lot of smoke is to use green wood, not dried wood.
You should smoke the fish for five days or longer if you plan to keep them for a long time. After that, wrap them in clean paper, put the fish in baskets and keep them in a cool, dry place off the ground.",high24105.txt
