0,B,"['To show his respect to his teacher', 'To ask us to appreciate every moment of our life', 'To ask us never to give in when facing difficulty', 'To show the influence that a teacher has on her students']",What is the purpose of the author's writing the passage?,"I had a very special teacher in high school many years ago whose husband unexpectedly died of a heart attack. About a week after his death, she shared some of her views with a classroom of students.
As the sunlight came in through the classroom windows and the class was nearly over, she moved a few things aside on the edge of her desk and sat down there. She paused and said, ""Before class is over, I would like to share with all of you a thought that is unrelated to class, but which I feel is important. Each of us comes to this world to learn, share, love, appreciate and give. None of us knows when this fantastic experience will end. It can be taken away at any moment.""
Her eyes beginning to water, she went on:
""So I would like you all to make me a promise. From now on, on your way to school, or on your way home, find something beautiful to notice. It doesn't have to be something you see. It could be a _ of freshly baked bread from someone's house, or it could be the sound of the wind slightly rustling the leaves in the trees...""
The class was completely quiet. We all picked up our books and left the room silently. That afternoon, I noticed more things on my way home from school.
Take notice of something special you see on your way home today. Go barefoot on the beach at sunset. For as we get older, it is not the things we did that we often regret, but the things we didn't do.",high8501.txt
