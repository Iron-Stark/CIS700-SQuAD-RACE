4,A,"['Keep My Deam', 'My Horse Rnch', ""Father's Lve"", 'My Goal']",Which of the following can be the best title of the passage?,"I have a friend named John Roberts who owns a horse ranch  in San Ysidro.The last time I was there he shared a story with me. ""It is a story about a young man who was the son of an itinerant horse trainer. When he was a senior,he was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to be and do when he grew up.""
That night he wrote a seven-page paper describing his goal of someday owning a horse ranch. He wrote about his dream in great detail and he even drew a diagram of a 200-acre ranch, showing the location of all the buildings,the stables and the track.
""The next day he handed it in to his teacher. Two days later he received his paper back. On the front page was a large red F with a note that read, 'See me after class.'""
""The boy went to see the teacher after class and asked, 'Why did I receive an F?'""
""The teacher said, 'This is an unrealistic dream for a young boy like you. You have no money. You come from an itinerant family. You have no resources. Owning a horse ranch requires a lot of money. You have to buy the land. You have to pay for the original breeding stock and later you'll have to pay large stud fees. There's no way you could ever do it.' Then the teacher added, 'If you will rewrite this paper with a more realistic goal, I will reconsider your grade.'""
""The boy went home and asked his father what he should do. His father said, 'Look, son, you have to make up your own mind on this. However, I think it is a very important decision for you.'""
""Finally,after sitting with it for a week, the boy turned in the same paper, making no changes at all. He stated, 'You can keep the F and I'll keep my dream.'""
John continued, ""I tell you this story because you are sitting in the middle of my 200-acre horse ranch. I still have that school paper framed over the fireplace."" He added, ""If I had changed my paper at that time, maybe we would not have the chance to be here talking about the dreams .""",high6401.txt
