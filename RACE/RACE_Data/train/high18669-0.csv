Could the smartest choice for a future career be the path that requires the least amount of effort?
And what's so wrong with applying yourself to seeking out a low stress option anyway? We looked to question-and-answer site Quora for some suggestions for the best jobs for smart but lazy people. Here's what the masses had to say:               
If you're unwilling to work far from your home office, Paul Denlinger suggested: ""Computer programmer: It is a continuous learning process, but you really don't have to work that hard and gradually you learn that many of the challenges are repetitive  .""
Even the nature of the work itself lends itself to doing less, he indicated, ""Good programmers write as few lines of code as possible, and it is one of those professions which pays well, while at the same time, encouraging laziness, Denlinger wrote. ""At the same time, you get to work with other reasonably intelligent, technical people, while the investors throw money at you for their next great idea.""
However, Chris Leong a programmer in Sydney suggested ""working for the government --  most roles have 35-hour weeks in Australia -- unless you become senior.""
Matthew Kuzma wrote: ""My personal opinion is that the best possible job for someone who is intelligent but lazy would be to be a professional 'expert' at something, to get paid to just share your thoughts and opinions about things with people who  will do the heavy lifting.""
He advises the lazy bones to ""identify the activities you don't consider work and find a career that will pay you for those. Chances are, the things you consider fun and easy are things someone else finds so hard that they're willing to pay you to do them.""
As it happens, taking a calm and relaxed approach to dealing with a project is not always a negative either. Arvind Krishnan quotes billionaire Bill Gates as saying ""I will always choose a lazy person to do a difficult job, because he will find an easy way to do it.""
So lazy-but-intelligent people of the world :""Look like you have a shot at Microsoft,"" wrote Krishnan.",high18669.txt
