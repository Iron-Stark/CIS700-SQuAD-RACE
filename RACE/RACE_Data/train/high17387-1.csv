About the tour:
This volcano tour takes you inside a volcano, through the top crater and down to the bottom of its magma chamber .
The Thrihnukagigur volcano has not erupted for 4,000 years and shows no signs of coming to life again anytime soon. Hence, you are safe!
You depart from Reykjavik and drive to the area of Blafjoll mountains (About 30 minutes' drive). From there, an easy 35- to 40-minute walk awaits you, in order to get to the volcano.
Using a system normally used to carry window cleaners outside skyscrapers, you will go down 120 metres in an open elevator, a basket lift that is supported by cable wires.
The group is split into smaller parties of four to five persons. The trip takes about 10 minutes and the first ones to go down will be the first ones to go up.
After exploring the volcano on the inside, you will walk back over the lava field where the coach awaits and transfers you back to Reykjavik.",high17387.txt
