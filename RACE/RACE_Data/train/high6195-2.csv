""It's a day to fill the skies with music and bring young people together in song,"" CME Executive Director Holly Nimmons said.
The CME started Music Monday in 2005.It is held every year on the first Monday of May.It was created to help people realize the importance of music education programs in schools and in communities.The day also celebrates the benefits of playing music for people of all ages.
NAMM researches the effects of music on children.They found that playing music has positive effects on thinking skills and on confidence.It also teaches selfdiscipline  and helps kids bond with their peers .""Learning musical skills can also help in your studies of other subjects,such as math,reading and language,"" Lora Bodmer,who works at NAMM,said.
Their studies show that music can also help people form friendships and connect with different groups.Nimmons says anyone can join in on the day,not just those who are musically gifted.""I think that we all have the music in us,and it's a matter of confidence,"" she said.""Sing with other people or beat drums,just enjoy the music.""
Participants can turn on the radio to join the fun.Each year a song is assigned to Music Monday.This year the song is ""Tomorrow Is Coming"" by Luke Doucet.The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation(CBC) will be playing the tune at 1 p.m. Eastern Time.People across North America will play or sing the song at the exact same time.The performance is meant to connect people through melody .More than 700,000 students took part in the concert last year.
