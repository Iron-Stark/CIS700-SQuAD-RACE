The next year, in the fourth grade, we met Jamie.The three of us soon became close friends.We played together almost every day.I thought even time couldn't pull us apart, but I was sadly mistaken.
The three of us started fighting a lot.Before Christmas, we had a really big fight, and Jamie and Jenna were against me, both saying _ .I felt helpless and lonely.I thought Christmas would be horrible!
I was surprised when Jenna came to my house and gave me an awesome Christmas card she had made for me.I was so sure that she was still disappointed with me.
""Wow, "" I said, breaking the silence as we stood on either side of my front door.""Thanks.""
""Okay...well...I have to go,"" she said softly.

""Who was that at the door?"" my mum asked.
The card started off with ""Merry Christmas"", but then it said, ""I am so glad we're friends.I am sorry about what I said when we were fighting.A fight won't stop us from being friends.Besides, we said we were going to be friends even when we're eight-two.""
