0,A,"['an apple tree', 'the best picture', 'curtains', 'birds']",Mr. Black drew_.,"Mr. Black and Mr. White were two very famous artists in the city. Their drawings were also very popular in the city. But they tried to see who could draw the best picture.
One day they asked an old man to be the judge. Mr. Black drew an apple tree. He put his picture in the field. Soon the birds came and tried to eat the apples. The old man saw it and said, ""You have certainly won. Mr. White cannot draw so good a picture as yours. But we will go to see his picture.""
They went to Mr. White's house. There were nothing but red beautiful curtains on the wall. The old man asked, ""Where is your picture, Mr. White?"" He said, ""Lift the curtains, and you will find my picture."" The old man tried to lift the curtains but found that they were drawn there. They were Mr. White's picture. The old man said, ""Birds thought the apples were real. Men thought the curtains were real. So Mr. White won. His picture is the best one.""",high9360.txt
