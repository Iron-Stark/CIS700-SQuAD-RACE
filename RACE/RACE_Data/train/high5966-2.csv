2,B,"['5 am.', '4 pm.', '11 am.', '9 pm.']",Which of the following is probably a better time to visit the famous temple built on a rock?,"Bali  is home to most of Indonesia's Hindu minority. Here's how to get the most out of a 48hour visit:
FRIDAY
3pm--There's nothing like a good meal. La Lucciola is the place to go, with its good food, great service and a beautiful view of the sea.
You can hire a car for some 450,000 rupiah per day. This will help you have more to spare during your trip there.
5pm--About an hour away from La Lucciola is Uluwatu. This southern tip of the island is famous for its temple that lies on the edge, high above the sea. Fire dance is performed here daily at sunset.
8pm--To finish off the evening, head to Jimbaran Bay where restaurants offer candles, dances, boys singing songs. Kick off your shoes, feel the sand, and enjoy the night.
SATURDAY
9:30am--Start the day with another taste of culture by heading for a ""barong and keris"" dance performance. It's held in many places. One is the Catur Eka Budi in Denpasar, capital of Bali.
12pm--About 50km from Denpasar is Kintamani, a favorite with tourists for the view of active volcano Mt. Batur. It's a good idea to reach Kintamani early as it gets cloudy after 3pm. Have lunch at a local restaurant with a view of Mt. Batur. Tourists can climb to Mt. Batur to catch the sunrise.
6:30pm--Spa time! Spa Hati is a good place. Book ahead.
SUNDAY
6am--It's time to go to the sea. Don't forget the camera.
10:30am--Another halfday trip to two of the most famous temples in Bali. Drive down to the Taman Ayun temple at Mengwi.
12am--Next up is the Tanah Lot temple, perhaps the most famous of them all. Built on a rock, it's best seen in the afternoon when it's against the sun or at sunset.",high5966.txt
