Several months ago, a group of 19 Taiwanese children flew to Chengdu in order to begin a tour to study pandas. The middle school children were from Chiayi Country in southwest Taiwan and were chosen because of their excellent performance at school.
During the visit, the children saw pandas up close. They were excited to see so many pandas at the same time. The children also traveled to the Mount E'mei scenic area and met local schoolchildren.
At last, they said, ""The pandas are very cute, and they are all happy."" They also said the children in Chengdu are very friendly to them, and they all like there. They hope to visit Sichuan again.",middle6021.txt
