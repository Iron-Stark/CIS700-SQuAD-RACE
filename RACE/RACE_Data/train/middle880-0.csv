They were free in their summer holiday. So they came to a village by a large lake. They liked fishing very much. Then the next day after they got there, they got to a boat and went fishing in the lake. They boated farther and farther. They came to an out-of-way place. They were very happy because there were a lot of fish. When it was time for them to go home, Bruce said to his friends: ""We'd better make a mark  here so that we will easily find the place tomorrow.""
""You're right."" Bruno said happily .""Let me do that.""
""How foolish,"" said Bruce. ""If it rains tonight, the rain water will wash the line  off, and how can we find the mark tomorrow. You must cut a line with your knife.""
