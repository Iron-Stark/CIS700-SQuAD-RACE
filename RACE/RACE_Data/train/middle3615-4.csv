4,A,"['Mike', 'Tom', 'Both Tom and Mike', 'The waiter']",Who took the apple first?   _,"Tom and Mike were good friends. Sometimes they were kind to each other, sometimes they were not. But all of their classmates said they were like brothers.
One day they went out for a walk together. At noon they were very hungry and they went into a restaurant to have lunch. The waiter came up to them and asked,""What can I do for you?""
""Please bring us two apples first."" said Tom.
When the waiter put two apples on the table, Mike took the bigger one at once. Tom got angry,
""You are impolite,Mike. Why don't you take the smaller one?"" Tom said.
""But I am right.""said Mike with a smile,""if I let you take first, which one will you choose?""
""Of course I'11 take the smaller one. ""said Tom.
""Yes.""Mike said,""If you take the smaller one,the bigger one will still be mine. Don't you think so?""
