4,B,"['The Old Man and the Butterfly', 'Life Struggle', 'How To Help a Butterfly Fly', 'Kindness and Rush']",Which is the best title for the passage?,"One day, a man found the cocoon   of a butterfly and he brought it home.
A few days later, the man saw a small hole in the cocoon. He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped.
So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly.
In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling  around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly.
The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid  from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly.
Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly.
So, the next time you are faced with a challenge or a problem, remember the butterfly.
