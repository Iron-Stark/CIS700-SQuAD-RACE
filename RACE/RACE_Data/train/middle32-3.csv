3,B,"['Surprised.', 'Proud', 'Sad.', 'Worried.']",How did Chen Hongsheng feel about their help to the poor children?,"How was your Children's Day? What kind of gifts did you get?
Eight third graders in some poor places in Hebei Province got new schoolbags as Children's Day gifts. They were very happy. There were pencils, pens, exercise books and many other school supplies in the schoolbags.
These schoolbags are from students in Beijing Zhongguancun Fourth Primary School. They are in Class 5, Grade 3. They raised money by themselves. They printed out their writings. Their head teacher Mrs Hou helped them to make books. They sold the books at their school to make 800 yuan.
Chen Hongsheng, 9 years old, is one of the students. ""We use 800 yuan to buy eight schoolbags at the post office. The post office workers give us a list of the kids. These kids live in poor places. We can choose eight kids by ourselves and post these schoolbags to them,"" she said very proudly. ""These schoolbags are gifts of our class. This summer vacation, I'll send out a schoolbag by myself. I hope the kid with my schoolbag can go to school happily like us in the new term.""",middle32.txt
