  Imagine it's late at night. You hear the smoke detectors go off. You smell smoke when you wake up. Do you know what to do?
If a fire starts in your home, remember your escape plan and leave as quickly as possible. Keep the following things in mind to make a safe escape.
* Call""Fire!""to warn everyone in your family.
* If you know where the fire is, close as many doors as possible between you and the fire.
* If you're in bed, roll out of bed and onto the floor. Crawl on the floor next to a wall. Being near the ground makes it easier to breathe. If possible, cover your mouth and nose with a wet cloth.
* Feel the entire surface of a door before you open it. If the door is warm or hot, do not open it. The fire is probably right outside your room. Find another way to leave the room. If the door is cool, open it a little.
* Look out and try to see the fire. If it is safe, leave the room. Remember to stay on the floor.
* If your clothes catch fire, stop immediately. Drop to the ground and roll. Remember:Stop, drop and roll.
* Call the fire department from outside and wait for help to arrive.",high20812.txt
