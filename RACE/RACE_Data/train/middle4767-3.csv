3,D,"['bus', 'train', 'coach', 'boat']","From the text, we can know that the game called ""Crossing Jurassic"" is a  _  trip.","Last summer, my family and I went on a trip to the China Dinosaur Park in Changzhou by bus. The one-hour trip seemed very long. We arrived at the park at about 9 a.m.
There were many fun places for us to choose from. We first went to the Crazy Firedrake Drill. When I looked at the giant yellow machine, I wasn't afraid at all, But when I was really on it, I felt a little nervous. First, the machine took us to the highest point. We all screamed  ""Ah"". 1 dared not look down. Then it turned around fast and moved very quickly at the same time. The wind was so strong that I couldn't open my eyes. I felt as if I would fall down. 1 couldn't stop screaming through the whole ride. It only moved for a few minutes, but it seemed to be many hours. When the game ended, I was too frightened to walk.
Later we took part in the game called ""Crossing Jurassic "". After waiting for half an hour, we got into a boat. The boat went into a tall building. It was dark around us. There were many model dinosaurs on both sides. They looked like the real ones. From time to time. the model dinosaurs made some frightening shouts,  which sounded terrible. The game ended with a sudden rush from a very high place into a big pool. What an exciting experience!",middle4767.txt
