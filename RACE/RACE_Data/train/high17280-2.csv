       Salesmen have discovered by experience over a long period of time that sugar sells badly in greenwrappings , that blue foods are considered not agreeable to the taste, and that cosmetics  should never be packed in brown. Their discoveries have grown into a whole subject of color1 psychology . Some of our preferences  for color1s are clearly psychological. Dark blue is the color1 of the night sky and therefore connected with calm, while yellow is a day color1 connected with energy and encouragement. Experiments have shown that color1s, partly because they are connected with psychology, also have a direct effect on people's mind. People in bright red surroundings show an increase in breathing speed, heartbeat and blood pressure; red is exciting. Pure blue has exactly the opposite effect; it is a calming color1. Being exciting, red was chosen as the signal for danger, but a close study shows that a bright yellow can produce a more basic state of alarm, so fire engines in some advanced areas are now rushing around in bright yellow color1s that stop buses, trucks and cars.",high17280.txt
