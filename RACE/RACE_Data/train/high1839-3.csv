3,B,"['The writer could run faster than Amery.', 'Amery forgave the writer for his rude behavior.', 'The writer liked playing on boys of all sizes.', 'Amery was a student in Grade Four.']",Which of the following is TRUE?,"I first went to Harrow in the summer term. The school had the biggest swimming pool I had ever seen. It was a good joke to come up behind a naked boy, and push him into the pool. I made quite a habit of this with boys of my own size or less.
One day I saw a boy wrapped in a towel on the side of the pool. He was no bigger than I was, so I thought him _ . Coming secretly behind, I pushed him in, holding on to his towel so that it would not get wet, I was surprised to see an angry face come out from the water, and a being of great strength masking its way by face strokes  to the shore. I fled, but in vain. He overtook me, seized me violently, and threw me into the deepest part of the pool. I soon climbed out on the other side, and found myself surrounded by a crowd of younger boys."" Do you know what you have done?"" they said, ""It's Amery; he is in Grade Six. He is champion at gym; he has got his football honor.""
I was frightened and felt ashamed. How could I tell his position when be was wrapped in a bath towel and so small."" He didn't seem pleased at all, so I added in a most brilliant word,"" My father, who is a great man, is also small."" At this be laughed, and after some general words about my rude behavior and how I had better be careful in the future, signified the incident was closed.",high1839.txt
