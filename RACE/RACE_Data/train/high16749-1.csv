1,D,"['To George and Carol only.', 'To the skeleton which he called ""old boy "".', 'Only to himself.', 'To all the students who attended his lecture.']",To whom did the professor really say these words ?,"George and Carol were medical students at the same college and, like many other college students, they enjoyed playing jokes on people. Both of them smoked, but they knew that their professor was strongly against it, because smoking was dangerous to one's health. One day they decided to play a joke on their professor. 
At one of their medical lectures there was always a skeleton in the room so that the professor could show the students the different bones in the human body. 
That afternoon, Carol and George put a cigarette in the mouth of the skeleton that was to be used for their next lecture. 
When the professor came in, he began talking and then noticed the cigarette. He went up to the skeleton, took the cigarette out of its mouth and said,"" You really should give them up, old boy. Look what they're doing to you!""",high16749.txt
