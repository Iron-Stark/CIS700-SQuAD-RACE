1,C,"['The author has grown tired of Chinese food.', ""Branches of Monmouth's cafe can be found all over the UK."", ""Most independent stores are closed on New Year's Day in the UK."", 'It is cool in the UK to take your first date to a chain restaurant.']",Which of the following statements is TRUE?,"In China, chain restaurants - especially the big multinational ones - are cool. Going to Starbucks, for example, is a status symbol. It not only says, ""I'm rich enough to buy this overpriced coffee,"" but also, ""I'm cosmopolitan   enough to be part of globalization.""
Where I come from in the UK, however, chains are neither fashionable nor gourmet . Chains are where you go on New Year's Day when nowhere else is open, or when you are 5 years old and your parents can't stand hearing, ""I'm huuuuuungry!"" any longer. In my own case (with regards to McDonald's), a chain is where you are taken on your first ""date"". Even at the age of 13, I knew to give the guy the ""let's just be friends"" phone call the next day.
In the UK, independent cafes and restaurants are making a comeback on the fashion scene. Nowadays, a Londoner who says ""let's meet for a coffee at Monmouth"" (an independent cafe) is much cooler than one who says ""let's go to Starbucks"". Even if Monmouth's coffee is a little more expensive, there's a satisfaction in knowing your pounds aren't going straight to the big corporations.
Of course, there are chain stores all over the UK; you can't go five minutes without spotting a Costa Coffee. But numbers do not add up to good taste.
I do, however, have a confession  . After moving to China I had moments when all the rice and Kung Pao Chicken became too much. I, too, have retreated to McDonald's.",high19488.txt
