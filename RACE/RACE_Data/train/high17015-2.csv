2,A,"['not everybody you meet on line is honest and reliable', 'it is not acceptable to post a photo of a friend on line', 'it is not safe by chatting with grown-ups on the website', 'only you and your friends can view your personal profile']",We can learn from the passage that_.,"Of all the websites,one that has attracted attention recently is  _ .Most of this attention has come from the media and tells every reason why the website should be shut down.The threat of internet predators is indeed a tough reality,but shutting down the site is not the answer.If  _ were shut down,another site would quickly take its place.Therefore,the right way is to teach teens how to use the site safely and educate them about who may be predators and how to avoid them.
The key to staying safe on the Internet is to make sure that your profile is secure.The simplest way is to change the privacy setting on your profile to ""private"", which protects your information so that only the people on your friend list can view it.Although this is effective,it is not perfect.Predators can find ways to view your profile if they really want to,whether through hacking in or figuring out their way onto your friend list.Thus,you should never post too much personal information.Some people actually post their home and school addresses,date of birth,and other personal information, often letting predators know exactly where they will be and when.The most information that is safe is your first name and province.Anything more is basically inviting a predator into your life.
Another big issue is photos. I suggest completely skipping photos and never posting a photo of a friend online without asking permission.
Most importantly, never,under any circumstances,agree to a real-life meeting with anyone you meet online.No matter how well you think you know this person, there are no guarantees that they have told the truth.But you could feel free to chat with people you meet on the site, but just remember that not everyone is who they say they are.Hopefully,the next time you edit your profile,you'll be more informed about the dangers of internet predators and take the steps to defend yourself.",high17015.txt
