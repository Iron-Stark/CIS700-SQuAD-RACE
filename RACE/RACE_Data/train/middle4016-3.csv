3,C,"['people will have enough food to eat in the future.', 'scientists can use 3D printers to print food now.', '3D printers are being put to many uses', 'people can get any food and vegetables without planting']",From the passage we know that  _  .,"3D printers are certainly the superstar today---they are being put to all kinds of uses, including creating model cars for movies. However, none of these ideas are as crazy as the one suggested by Anjan Contractor, who believes that they will be the key to ending world hunger .
If you think that sounds a little crazy, you are not the only one, but after hearing scientists, the idea seems to become true.
According to scientists, food will become _ expensive and possibly, even out of reach, for billions of people in the future. It means billions of people won't have enough food.
This is where 3D printers may save the day. Anjan, an engineer says that the only way to support the large population will be to provide every kitchen with a 3D printer and print out meals.
More importantly, it would be to make the basic food from things that we now do not think can be eaten. Anjan thinks that we could easily get the meat protein  from insects . Similarly, the vegetable nutrition could be made from greens like grass. Would you want to try 3D printed food?",middle4016.txt
