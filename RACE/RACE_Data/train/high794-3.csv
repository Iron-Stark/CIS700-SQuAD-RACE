3,A,"['Australia puts off the decision on whether the koala is endangered.', 'Australia is taking special measures to protect koalas.', 'The population of koalas is reducing rapidly.', 'Australians are concerned about koalas.']",What is the main idea of the text?,"Tony Burke, Australia's environment minister, says he won't decide until next year whether the koala should be protected as an endangered species. He was expected to make his decision by the end of October. But that decision has been put off. Burke said he needed more time to go over the latest information about the koala's population.
In September, an Australian Senate committee reported that there was no question the koala's population is on the decrease. ""But they may not yet be eligible   for listing as a threatened species,"" said Senator Doug Cameron. ""To have such a significant Australian icon  included on the threatened species list would be a national shame.""
The koala is found only in the eucalyptus   forests of Australia. And its population is reported to have fallen sharply for many reasons, including the cutting down of forests to make way for human beings' development, their own illness, climate change and killings by other animals such as wild dogs. And every year many koalas are hit by cars as they are trying to cross the busy roads.
Putting off the decision on protection for the koala ""is really bad news,"" said Debbie Pointing, the president of the Koala Action Group. ""We've worked tirelessly for many years to gather data on the populations,"" Pointing said. ""That data should be enough to make a decision.""
However, Burke pointed out that the Australian government had spent at least $6.3 million on koala conservation efforts since 1996. senators listed efforts that are already underway in Queensland - the construction of special koala bridges as well as fences along roads, to keep the animals out of harm's way.
Some people say that is not enough. ""What we're doing at the moment is likely to drive this species to extinction,"" Queensland University zoologist Bill Ellis said.
""Koalas are an iconic Australian animal,"" Burke told Australians. ""They hold a special place in the hearts of Australians.""
But it is a fact that if more isn't done to protect the koala, they might soon hold a place only in Australians' memories.",high794.txt
