1,A,"['He had a conversation with a traveler.', 'What he did made Mother very angry.', 'But once more his memory failed him.', 'He wanted to put the package in the stove.']",What was done first by the father?,"A family living in an apartment house in the suburbs of a large city had a cat of which they were very much fond. One day the cat got sick and finally dies. As there was no back yard to their home in which to bury the cat. Father was forced to wrap the cat up in a newspaper and take it with him, being carefully reminded by Mother to throw the package from the train window when on the way to his work.
Father placed his bag upon the package shelf over his seat, but started to have a conversation with a traveler and forgot to throw the bag out of the window. He took the package on to his office, thinking that he would deal with it on his way home that evening. But again he got to talking to someone on the train, forgot about the cat, and still had the package under his arm when he arrived home. His wife scolded him about it and Father promised to take care of the matter the next day. But once more his memory failed him. When for the third time he arrived home still carrying the package, the poor Mother became quite angry.
""You've got to deal with that cat right now,"" she said. ""Put it in the stove right now as the fireman is seldom there at this hour."" Well, Father decided perhaps he'd better take it to the room and put it in the stove, but as he lifted the bag from a table, it fell open, and to their surprise there was a boiled ham!
