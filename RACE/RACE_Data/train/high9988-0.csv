0,D,"['realize his childhood dream', 'ease his serious heart condition', 'earn money to pay for treatment', 'keep himself occupied and happy']",The author's father worked at the local hospital to  _  .,"Many years ago,my dad was facing a serious heart condition.He was unable to do a steady job.He fell suddenly ill and had to be admitted to the hospital
He wanted to do something to keep himself busy, so he decided to volunteer at the local children's hospital.My dad loved kids.It was the perfect job for him.He ended up working with the seriously ill children.He would talk,play, and do arts with them.
One of his kids was a girl with a rare disease that paralyzed her from the neck down.She couldn't do anything,and she was very depressed.My dad decided to try to help her.He started visiting her in her room,bringing paints,brushes and paper.He stood the paper up,put the paintbrush in his mouth and began to paint.He didn't use his hands at a11.All the while he would tell her, ""See,you can do anything you set your mind to.''
At the end of the day, she began to paint using her mouth,and she and my dad became friends.Soon after, the little girl was sent home because the doctors felt there was nothing else they could do for her.My dad also left the children's hospital for a little while because he became i11.Some time later after my dad had recovered and returned to work,in came the little girl who had been paralyzed and only this time she was walking.She ran straight over to my dad and hugged him really tight.She gave him a picture she had done using her hands.At the bottom it read:""Thank you for helping me walk.''
My dad would cry every time he told US this story and SO would we.He would say sometimes love is more powerful than doctor, and my dad--who died just a few months after the little girl gave the picture--loved every single child in that hospital.",high9988.txt
