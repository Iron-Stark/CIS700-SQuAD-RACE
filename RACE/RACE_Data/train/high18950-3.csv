You may 1ike eating bananas.But do you know there is such a thing, a ""banana person""? How strange! Are these people from ""another earth""? No, they are just Chinese people like you and me.
ABC means American-born Chinese.An ABC is a Chinese, but was born in the United States.Sometimes,people call an ABC a ""banana person"".A banana is yellow outside but white inside--their life and minds inside are Westerners, but they look like Chinese outside.
Do you know why? Usually, ABCs know little about China or Chinese language.Some of them don't speak Chinese.Also, they are not interested in Chinese politics .
But if ABCs cannot speak Chinese.can we still call them Chinese people? Yes,of course.They are Chinese.They are overseas  Chinese.These people may be citizens of another country like the US, Canada or Singapore.But they have Chinese blood.Their parents, grandparents or great-grandparents were from China.They all have black eyes and black hair.But they are not Chinese citizens.For example.we all know the famous scientist C.N.Yang .He got the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1957.Chinese people love him.But he is an American citizen",high18950.txt
