0,B,"['A best selling coffee.', 'A special educational program.', 'Government support for schools.', 'A new type of teacher- student relationship.']",What is the text mainly about?,"EDGEWOOD-EVERY morning at Dixie Heights High School, customers pour into a special experiment; the district's first coffee run mostly by students with special learning needs.
Well before classes start, students and teachers order Lattes Cappuccinos and Hot Chocolates. Then, durning the first period teachers call in orders on their room phones, and students make deliveries.
By closing tome  at 9.20 a.m., the shop usually sells 90 drinks.
""Whoever made the chi tea, Ms. Schatzman says it was good,"" Christy McKinley, a second year student, announced recently, after hanging up with the teacher.
The shop is called the Dixie PIT, which stands for Power in Transition. Although some of the students are not disabled, many are, and the PIT helps them prepare for life after high school.
They learn not only how to run a coffee shop but also how to deal with their affairs. They keep a timecard and receive paychecks, which they keep in check registers.
Special-education teachers Kim Chevalier and Sue Casey introduced the Dixie PIT from a similar program at Kennesaw Mountain High School in Georgia.
Not that it was easy. Chevalier's first problem to overcome was product-related. Should school be selling coffee? What about sugar content?
Kenton County Food Service Director Ginger Gray helped. She made sure all the drinks, which use non fat milk, fell within nutrition  guidelines.
The whole school has joined in to help.
Teachers agreed to give up their lounge  in the mornings. Art students painted the name of the shop on the wall. Business students designed the paychecks.  The basketball team helped pay for cups.",high7156.txt
