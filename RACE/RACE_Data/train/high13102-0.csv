1.1. What is PISA?
PISA stands for the Programme for International Student Assessment, sponsored by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). PISA 2015 is the sixth PISA study that has been conducted since 2000 and involves more than 70 participating countries.
PISA has the following characteristics:
* It is the world's largest international survey in education.
* It surveys students aged about 15 years.
* It assesses students' preparedness for adult life.
Undertaking PISA is important because the results of the test can be used:
* to indicate how well prepared students in a country/economy are for learning once they leave school;
* to identify areas for improvement over time by schools, education systems, and governments; and
* to allow a comparison of student performance and the learning environment between different countries.
1.2. Components of PISA 2015
* 1.2.1. Cognitive test
42 students from each school will be randomly sampled to complete a 2-hour computer-based test consisting of questions in science, mathematics, reading, and Collaborative Problem Solving.
* 1.2.2. Questionnaires
These students will also be asked to complete a 30 minutes Student Questionnaire on the computer either directly after the test sections or at a later time.
* 1.2.3. Financial Literacy assessment
After the cognitive test and questionnaires, a sub-sample of 10-11 students will take a computer-based Financial Literacy(FL) assessment. The 65-minute Financial Literacy assessment tests students' knowledge of personal finances and their ability to apply it to their financial problems.",high13102.txt
