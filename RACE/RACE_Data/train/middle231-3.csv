From the world's heaviest apple, the oldest lady to the world's smallest dog, these are all parts of a group of the world's strangest people and things. And they are all in the Guinness Book of Records(<<>> ).
The book is going to celebrate its birthday this August. It began exactly half a century ago. And it's always one of the best selling books in the world.
People now can break over 1000 records every week! Why do so many people want to break the records? Do they want their names in the book or meet more people around the world? ""It gives people a chance to show they're the best in the world."" said one of the record keepers Stewart Newport.
The book was started by Hugh Beaver from Britain. In 1951, he went shooting birds and talked with his friends about the fastest bird in Europe. Three years later, they were still talking about it. So Beaver believed that people must have different ideas. So, he decided to start a book to record the world's truly greatest people and things in it!
The newest book came out last Tuesday. This book has a lot of interesting records. Here are two:
 A British dog, Whitney, is the world's smallest dog. It's only 76mm tall.
 An American woman Lee Redmond has the longest fingernails .They grew as long as 600 mm! She made the record in 1971.",middle231.txt
