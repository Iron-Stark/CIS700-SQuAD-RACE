0,B,"['men are wiser in choosing hotels', 'guests usually care about fort most', 'women differ from men in judging a hotel', 'hotels have difficulty satisfying each guest']",We can learn from the text that Bella Sky Hotel   _  .,"When you walk into a room on the 17th floor of Copenhagen's Bella Sky Hotel, you'll be greeted by soft roses and other fresh flowers, fruits, fashion magazines, and a bathroom with beauty products. This is Europe's first hotel floor dedicated entirely to women--and according to the hotel's CEO Arne Bang Mikkelsen, it is designed by women, for women.
""Women's hotel preferences are very different from men's with key priorities being to feel safe and comfortable. When men come into a hotel room, the first thing they do is check the view, turn on the TV, plug in their computer, and check out the fridge. Women, on the other hand, go straight to the bathroom. Does it smell nice? Is it clean? Does it have a nice bathtub and shower?""
Unlike other hotels, it seemed like someone actually thought about what women wanted. To get it right, the hotel asked a number of women what they wanted, and added to their list of things like cleanliness, a nice bathroom, high-powered hairdryers, steam irons, cosmetic mirrors, healthy choices on the room service menus, and full-body mirrors.
It seems that they are helped by the boom in female business travelers. Global numbers are hard to get, but a research report shows women account for about half of all business travelers in the US in 2010, up from approximately 25% in 1991.
Places like the Naumi Hotel in Singapore, the Premier Hotel in New York, the London Dukes Hotel and the Georgian Court Hotel in Vancouver seem to be realizing the possibility in catering for women.
At the London Dukes Hotel, the manager says bookings for their ""Duchess Rooms"",which are standard rooms with fresh flowers, fruit, and styling things, have increased 25% over the past year.",high11053.txt
