0,C,"['A friend in need is a friend indeed', 'How to make friendship last for ever', 'You are who your friends are', ""Friends are the most important in one's success""]",Which of the following would be the best title for this passage?,"The other day I heard a few local musicians talking:
""I hate all the terrible pianos in this town. I hate that rubbish they play on the radio. They can't even understand a bit of music.""
""I'm never playing in that club again. Too many drunks and nobody listens to us.""
But, one younger musician said, ""There are a few clubs that book my band a few nights a month, and I'm trying to find other places to play. I'm also looking to book a few summer festivals this year.""
I've heard that you are the average of the five people whom you spend the most time with, or to put it another way, you are who your friends are.
Attitudes are important. Whether they're positive or negative, they're rubbing off on you. If you're around people who complain about lack of work and about other musicians, or blame   others, and you play the role of victim  , chances are you will start to as well. So it's time to take a look at the people you call ""friends"".
This is an easy exercise: Make a list of the people who you hang out with, and simply stop spending time with the negative people on your list. Set a new standard   for yourself and don't become friends with people who fall below that standard.
Keep successful people around you and your own chances for success will be much better. Ask them how they do it. Ask if they will help you get the work you're looking for, or maybe give you some advice to help you on your career path.",high2706.txt
