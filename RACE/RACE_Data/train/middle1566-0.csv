Mark Twain was asked one day if he could remember the first money he ever earned.
He thought a long time and then said , ""Yes, it was at school.I can remember everything about it .School boys in those days did not take good care of their chairs and desks.There was a rule in our school that if anyone damaged his desk or chair, he would have to pay five dollars or  the teacher would beat him in front of the whole school.""
""One day I damaged my desk in some way, I had to pay five dollars or be beaten before the whole school.My father said it would be too bad to have our family disgraced in front of the whole school.He agreed to give me five dollars to hand over the teacher.But before he gave me the money, he took me upstairs and gave me a beating.""
""But as I had one beating and I decided I would take another beating at school and keep the  five dollars.So that's what I did.That was the first money I ever earned.""",middle1566.txt
