One day a lady wrote to a doctor inviting him to have dinner at her house. The doctor wrote an answer, but he didn't write clearly and the lady couldn't read it.
""What shall I do?"" she said to her husband, ""I don't know whether he is coming or not. I don't want to give him a telephone call and say that I can't read his writing.""
