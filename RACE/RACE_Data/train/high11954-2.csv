This system of learned behavior patterns characteristic of the members of a given society is constantly shaped by a set of dynamic variables : language, religion, values and attitudes, manners and customs, aesthetics, technology, education, and social institutions. To deal with this system, an international manager needs both factual and interpretive knowledge of culture.

The most complicated problems in dealing with the cultural environment lie in the fact that one cannot learn culture--one has to live it. Two schools of thought exist in the business world on how to deal with cultural differences. One is that business is business the world around, following the model of Pepsi and McDonald's. In some cases, globalization is a fact of life; however, cultural differences are still far from disappearing.
The other school suggests that companies must adjust business approaches to individual cultures.
