0,D,"['the old lady had died', 'a young man moved in', 'the old man could not live alone', 'the grandson made a lot of noise']",Bill's family got angry because   _  .,"Bill and his family has been living in the six-family building for years. All the neighbors got along fairly well with each other until recently.
An old man and his wife used to live on the second floor. Bill's mother and the old lady were good friends. Unfortunately the lady died last month. Her husband could not live alone, so he had his grandson move over and live with him.
The grandson has become a problem to all the neighbors, especially to Bill's family. The walls of the building are thin and he is noisy. Bill is used to peace and quiet but the young man likes to listen to the radio late at night. Sometimes friends of his visit and they make a lot of noise. That is too much for Bill's family.
Bill's mother once asked the old man politely if he was able to sleep well at night, but obviously the man didn't understand what she meant. If he did and spoke to his grandson, the young man obviously didn't listen, since things haven't changed any. Everyone in Bill's family agrees that something must be done though they don't want to hurt the kind old man.",high116.txt
