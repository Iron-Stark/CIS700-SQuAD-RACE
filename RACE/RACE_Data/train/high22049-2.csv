2,C,"[""parents shouldn't let children watch TV"", 'We should believe everything on TV', 'we can choose TV programs', ""parents shouldn't watch TV""]",We can learn from the passage that   _  .,"Television has a huge influence on our lives. It is one of the most important ways of getting information. People spend part of their spare time watching television, and much of what they learn comes from it.
  What we see on TV-movies, news shows, sports shows, advertisements and so on have increased our knowledge and have changed the way we learn about the world today. However, not everything on TV is true.
  Most of the viewers are children. Television sometimes is like a baby-sitter . It spends more time with children than parents do. But it keeps them in the living room away from healthy outdoor activities. They spend less time playing soccer or walking in the park or playing games in the yard.
  Of course, there are some programs on TV that are good for children. But there are also some shows which are bad. Children should not watch unhealthy shows. Maybe we can't change what is on TV, but we can choose what we watch. Do you agree?",high22049.txt
