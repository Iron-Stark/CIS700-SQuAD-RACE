Coming from the south end of Princes Street, you will see the library on your right. Next to the library is Goddington University. Take the next turning on the right, then first right into the car park gate straight ahead of you, stopping as close as possible to the orange machine. Put a $ 1 coin in the machine and the gate will rise.
If travelling by train/bus/ taxi
You will need to allow 30 minutes to walk from the train station. Taxis are available from the front of the station.
