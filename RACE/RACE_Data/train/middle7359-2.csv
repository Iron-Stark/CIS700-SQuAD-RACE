2,D,"['Ekon wanted to build a bridge by himself.', 'Ekon and his family finished building the bridge.', 'After the bridge was built,Ekon died.', 'Why the mountains are made of stone.']",What's the main idea of the passage?,"At the beginning of the world,a man named Ekon lived in Luzon.He liked to build things.He thought it would be a very good idea to build a bridge to the sky.
As he wanted the bridge to be strong and last a long time,he built it of stone.He worked for years and years to build the bridge.His wife and children,nephews and nieces,uncles and aunts,all helped him.Though they worked very hard,the sky always seemed to be a long distance  away.
When Ekon became an old man,his wife and children told him that he would never finish it.
""If I can't finish it."" he said.""my children's children will do so.""
But just before he died,his wife and children told him that they could not find any more stones.
So Ekon became very angry and disappointed.Though he was very old and weak,he pulled down the bridge.It came tumbling  with a great roar .
The stones made great heaps  all over the country.These great heaps of stones are what we now call mountains.Ekon was _ under one of them himself.",middle7359.txt
