0,D,"['was a year senior to Jem and had a wide knowledge of dramas', 'was a dull boy and unwilling to talk about his father', 'left for Maycomb County for another Beautiful Child contest', 'gained much knowledge from the picture shows']",From the passage we can learn that Dill  _  .,"When I was almost six and Jem nearly ten,our summertime boundaries were Mrs. Henry
Lafayette Dubose's house two doors to the north of us,and the Radley Place three doors to the south.The Radley Place was said to be a ghostly house
    That was the summer Dill came to us.
    Early one morning Jem and I heard something next door in Miss Rachel Haverford's baekyard.We looked to the right and found someone looking at us.
    ""Hey.""
   ""Hey yourself.How old are you?""asked Jem.
   ""Goin' on seven.''
   ""You look right puny for goin' on seven.""said Jem.
   ""I'm little but I'm old.""he said.
    Jem looked at him,""Charles Baker Harris? Lord, what a name!""
   ""Folks call me Dill,""said Dill,struggling under the fence
   ""Do better if you go over it instead of under it,""I said""Where'd you come from? ""
    Dill,from Meridian,Mississippi,was spending the summer with his aunt,Miss Rachel.His family was from Maycomb County originally;his mother worked for a photographer in Meridian,had entered his picture in a Beautiful Child contest and won five dollars.She gave the money to Dill,who went to the picture show twenty times on it.
   ""Don't have any picture shows here.""said Jem.""Ever see anything good?""
    Dill had seen Dracula,a revelation that moved Jem to envy him.""Tell it to us.""
    Dill was a curiosity He was a year my senior but I towered over him.
    When Dill reduced Dracula to dust,and Jem said the show sounded better than the book ,I asked Dill where his father was,""You ain't said anything about him.""
    ""I haven't got one.""
     ""Is he dead?""
     ""No''
    ""Then if he's not dead you've got one,haven't you? ""
     Seeing Dill uneasy, Jem told me to hush,a sure sign that Dill had been studied and found acceptable.Thereafter the summer passed in drama sharing.Dill played the character parts
before us-the ape in Tarzan, Mr. Crabtree in The Rover Boys.Thus we came to know Dill as a pocket Merlin,whose head was full of strange plans and fancies
     But by the end of August Dill gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out.
     Word went that any stealthy small crimes in Maycomb were committed by the evil phantom living in the Radley Place.Once pigs in town were found killed on a cold night; although the criminal was Crazy Addie,people still looked at the Radley Place in doubts",high17465.txt
