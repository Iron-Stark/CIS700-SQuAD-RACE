0,C,"['both fathers and mothers take it as a hobby', 'neither fathers nor mothers spend enough time on child-care', ""parents don't share the same amount of child-care"", ""fathers don't like the kids at all""]","In Australian parenting,   _  .","Can it be true that Australian men spend more time during the week brushing their teeth than they do alone with their children?
A new study from the University of the New South Wales has discovered that during the working week, Aussie fathers only spend an average of just over a minute each day alone with their children. Australian mothers, on the other hand, spend three hours a week looking after their children -a much greater disparity  than in other countries like America, Denmark, Italy and France, where couples divide the child-care more evenly.
These findings will upset those who want to shake off the perhaps unfair image of the Australia as a land of old-fashioned male chauvinism .
According to the study, Australian fathers appear to like the fun aspects of parenthood, but shy away from the drudgery. So while they tend to be happy taking the kids to the park or to sports events, they are unlikely to participate regularly in feeding, bathing, or taking the kids to school. In short, parenting is seen as a woman's job and a man's hobby in Australia.
Many people believe that in Europe the last twenty years have seen the arrival of the so-called ""new man""--the man who is willing to share the housework and child-care. The ""new man"" never misses his children's school plays and he always gets home in time to read their bedtime story. Indeed, a questionnaire conducted in the UK indicated that almost 70% of British women thought that men were as good at raising children as women.",high23723.txt
