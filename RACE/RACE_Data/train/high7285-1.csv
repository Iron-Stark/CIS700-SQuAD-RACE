1,B,"['Determination guarantees you a success.', 'The race of life with intent.', ""Nothing is impossible in one's life race."", 'The benefits of taking up running.']",What's the best title for this passage?,"Buckminster Fuller once said, ""The minute you choose to do what you really want to do, it's a different kind of life."" If you want to live abundantly, decide what you really want and figure out a way to do it. Be clear and live with intent  .
You may have heard of Fred Lebow. He complained to his doctor that he lacked energy. His doctor advised him to take up running. He fell in love with it! He was 39 years old when he entered his first race.
Fred joined the New York Road Runners Club and organized New York City's first marathon race. But what Fred truly wanted to do was to bring people together. He believes that anybody should be able to run -- people of all ages and of any country.
Not everyone in New York was excited about people running through their neighborhood. A youth gang warned him that nobody had better run through their turf. ""That's great,"" Fred said. ""I need someone to protect the runners in your area, and you look like just the fellows to do it.""
He gave them each a hat, shirt and jacket and that year, when the marathon went through their neighborhood, these young men proudly guarded the runners along their way.
Fred decided what was truly important to him and he found a way to do it. He lived with intent. That single decision made his life remarkably different.
As one sports writer said, ""Fate handed him a short race. With his goal, with his love of life, Fred turned it into a marathon."" Fred would say that it's not about how long you live, but how you run the race of life.",high7285.txt
