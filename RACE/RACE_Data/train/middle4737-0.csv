0,C,"['one year', 'half a year', 'about four years', 'two years']",I travel to work by bus for   _  .,"If you go to visit London, you'll see a lot of buses and cars on the road. You'll also see many bikes because more people travel by bike. Why? There are many reasons. First, it is very cheap to buy a bike, and it is quick, too. You often need to wait for a bus for half an hour. When the bus comes, there are so many other buses and cars on the roads, so the bus moves very slowly.
I travel to work by bus for about four years. I often arrive at work late and feel tired. Then one day, a friend of mine says, ""I go to work by bike. Why don't we travel together?"" ""Because my bike is old, and there are so many buses and cars on the roads. I'll feel frightened."" I answer. ""Don't be afraid, if you follow me and we ride slowly, you'll be fine."" he says.
Later, I buy a new bike. We go slowly, but we arrive at work quickly. I spend 40 minutes going by bus, but only half an hour by bike! Now I love riding a bike. And I feel healthy. Many people think my idea is good and maybe you'll see more bikes on the road in the future.",middle4737.txt
