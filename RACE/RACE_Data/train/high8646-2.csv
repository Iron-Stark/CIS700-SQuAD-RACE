I wear braces   and I know I look just terrible in them. Is there anything I can do to improve my appearance until they come off?

Dear Connie,
Start by thinking about how good you are going to look when your braces come off. If you are negative about your appearance, people will pick that up right away about you. In the meantime there are several things that you can do to lift your spirits:
Change your hairstyle. Be sure to get a good cut so that the shape of your hair will be flattering to your face and also good for your type of hair (fine, thick, straight, curly, etc.) Choose a hairstyle that draws attention away from your face. Hair pulled back into a pony-tail or into a ball on top or slightly off-center can be attractive and practical for this purpose.
Keep skin clean. If you choose to wear makeup , it should look natural. Blusher  and lip gloss  in light tones of peach or pink are best.
Be well-groomed . Neatness really _ . People see a total look about you before they ever become aware of your braces. And first impressions are lasting ones!",high8646.txt
