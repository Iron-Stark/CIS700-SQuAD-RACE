1,C,"['the eye-controlling technology was first developed for the blind', 'the present developing 0f the technology will bring no good', 'there is no such a phone as we can use only with our eyes at present', 'the eye-controlling technology is only intended for the disabled people']","According to the passage,we can learn that  _  .","In the near future,we may be using our eyes to operate our smart-phones and tablets,even when it comes to playing popular games like Fruit Ninja.
The Gaze Group has been developing eye-controlled computer technology for nearly 20 years.But those devices have been firstly designed to help those with disabilities,and are very expensive.
""After a while,we figured out that probably the best way is to go for a mass-market way,"" says Gaze's Sune Alstrup Johansen.""where everybody would have this available.""
Johansen and some of his colleagues have formed a new company,the Eye Tribe,which is hoping to develop the technology on a mass commercial level.
The technology works with the help of the computing device toward the user's face. After making sure of the user's eye movements,the technology is then able to easily find where a person's eyes are moving,and then allow the eyes to control a cursor .
""Our software can then determine the location of the eyes and know where you're looking on the screen to make sure what you're looking at,""reads an explanation on the Eye Tribe site.
There has been a gradual change toward hands-free technology in recent years, particularly in the gaming world.Recently Xbox released the Kinect device,which lets users control their Xbox and play certain games using only their hands,legs and voices. But still,most of these devices have been more of a _ than a practical way to use one's hands to control a mobile device.Johansen said a replaceable filter would be a cheap,convenient way for most consumers.
And even as companies like The Eye Tribe work to create such a product for the average user, making the eye-controlled technology more accessible and less expensive will have similar benefits for physically disabled users.
