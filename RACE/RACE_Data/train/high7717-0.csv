It was a small town which lay by the coast.Most people there lived by catching fish.The hurricanes often struck the area from July to October.Some of the people died on the sea when their boats were blown over by the high winds.So they paid much attention to the weather forecasts.They were afraid to meet with the hurricanes when they were catching fish on the sea.Each of the families had a radio and people always took them with themselves and listened to them at any time.
It was September.A hurricane attacked the town one night.Plenty of trees were pushed over and all the electric and telephone lines were broken.People couldn't watch TV,or call their friends,or go to work.To their anger,they couldn't listen to the weather forecasts the Town Radio Station broadcast.The food and fresh water would soon be short and the patients couldn't be given medical care--no medicine could be carried there.People didn't know what would happen and they looked anxious.
On the fourth day they read an announcement on the Town Weekly.It was written,""Recently we have to stop the weather forecast because of the bad weather.We usually get the forecasts from the airport.But the roads are all blocked by the fallen trees and stones.Whether or not we'll be able to broadcast the weather forecast tomorrow depends on the weather!""",high7717.txt
