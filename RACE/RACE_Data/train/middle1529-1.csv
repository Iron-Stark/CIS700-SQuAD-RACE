1,C,"['art', 'sports', 'music', 'science']",Jane wants to join the   _    club.,"Dear Grace,
How are you? Thank you for your last e-mail. You want to know about my school clubs, right ? Well, it's time for us to join the school clubs now. There are many clubs in my school, like the English club, the art club, the music club and the sports club. I have two good friends, Jack and Lisa. We all want to join the school clubs.
I want to join the music club, because I can play the guitar. I can't speak English well, but I also want to join the English club.
Jack likes sports. He can play soccer and basketball. He is in the school soccer team . He wants to join the sports club. He can play the guitar, too. But he doesn't want to join the music club.
Lisa likes drawing. She wants to join the art club. She also speaks English very well. I think she can be in the English club. But she can't be in the music club. She can't play any instruments .
Are there any clubs in your school? What club are you in?
Please write an e--mail and tell me about your school clubs.
Yours,
Jane",middle1529.txt
