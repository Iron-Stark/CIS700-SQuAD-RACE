2,B,"['write an email to him soon', 'send some photos to him', 'join the PE Club with him', 'introduce some Chinese friends to him']",Mike asks Da Peng to   _  .,"Dear Da Peng,
Thanks for your email. And thank you for introducing  your Chinese friend Li Fang to me. You are the class monitor for this term. That's good. Work hard! Try to help your teacher.
My classmates choose me as the PE monitor in our class because I run very fast. My PE teacher and my classmates like me. They also want me to _ the PE Club. I think that is a good idea. We can play basketball or football at weekends.
Please send some of your photos to me.
Yours,
Mike",middle7015.txt
