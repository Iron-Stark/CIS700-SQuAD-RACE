0,D,"['2', '3', '4', '5']",_   people in the family went to Disneyland.,"When my two children were young, we took a trip to Disneyland with their grandma. Although the park is about an hour car ride from our home, we decided to spend the night in a hotel, so we could spend more time in the park. In the evening, the famous Disneyland Parade started. My husband took our daughter and ran to have a look, leaving me with grandma and our son who was in a stroller  .
Because I am short, and grandma is shorter, we couldn't see them, and didn't know where they were. Grandma decided to find them. I told her not to, because I didn't want to lose her. But she walked off, and was soon lost. I made my way to the exit , because I thought everyone would get there, and they did. Then we waited for the hotel bus ----it  never came. So we called them. They told us that there was something wrong with their bus, and that we have to take a taxi. We finally got back to our hotel.
Today when I think of Disneyland, I think of that day.",middle1976.txt
