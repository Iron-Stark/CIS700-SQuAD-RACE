The next year, in Grade Four, we met Jamie. The three of us soon became close friends. We played together almost every day. I thought even time couldn't pull us apart, but I was sadly mistaken.
The three of us started fighting a lot. Before Christmas, We had a really big fight, and Jamie and Jenna were against me, both saying I was bossy  . I felt helpless and lonely. I thought Christmas would be horrible!

""Wow,"" I said, breaking the silence as we stood on either side of my front door. ""Thanks.""
""Okay...well... I have to go,"" she said softly.
""Okay. See you later then..."" and I closed the door.

""It was Jenna, my classmate."" I said.
The card started off with ""Merry Christmas"", but then it said, ""I am so glad we're friends. I am sorry about what I said when we were fighting. A fight won't stop us from being friends. Besides, we said we were going to be friends even when we're eighty-two.""
