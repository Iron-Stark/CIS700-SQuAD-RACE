2,A,"['Many of them live on social security money which is hardly enough.', 'Minority of them remain in a state of near poverty after their retirement.', 'Many nursing homes are sponsored by religious and nonprofit groups.', 'Older people have wealth or private insurance if they have a serious illness.']","According to the passage, which of the following statements about the old people in the United States is true?","Prolonging human life has increased the size of the human population.
