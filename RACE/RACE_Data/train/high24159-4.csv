It's in your interest to be aware of your online reputation and to take the necessary actions to make it what you want it to be.
   The first step in protecting or improving your online reputation is to find out what information is already posted on the Internet and to assess the impression it leaves on people. Follow these tips to monitor and evaluate your online reputation:
   Play the name game. Begin by typing your first and last name into several popular search engines to see where you are mentioned and in what context.
   Example:
   Robin Counts
   Focus your search. To get moreprecise  results, put quotation marks around your name, so that the search engine reads your name as a phrase and not as two or more unrelated words that just happen to appear in the text.
   Example:
""Robin Counts""
   Search all of your names. If you have ever used a different name, if you use your middle name or initial, if you use a nickname, or if your name is frequently misspelled, search all variations to make sure you don't miss anything important.
   Example:
   ""Robin Counts""
   ""Robin J. Counts""
   ""Robin Counts Jensen""
   Be strategic. If your search turns up information about other people who share your name, you caneliminate  many false hits by using keywords. You can add keywords that apply only to you; for example your city, your employer, or a hobby.
   Example:
   ""Robin Counts"" ""Woodgrove Bank""
   ""Robin counts""----skydiving
   Go blogging. If any of your friends, family members or coworkers have blogs or personal Web pages on social networking sites, check them out from time to time to see if they are writing about you or posting pictures of you.
   Be alert. Use the feature provided by some search engines that enables you to receive automatic notification   of any new mention of your name or other personal information.",high24159.txt
