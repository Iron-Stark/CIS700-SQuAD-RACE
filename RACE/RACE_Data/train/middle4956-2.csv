2,C,"['Shout in a loud voice.', 'Hurt others with our hands.', 'Do some chores that you really hate.', 'Walk to the place that makes you angry.']",How can we get the angry feeling out according to the passage?,"Sometimes you just get so angry that you feel like you are going to burst . It may seem like your anger will be the boss of you, instead of you being the boss of your anger. What can you do to work off that anger and keep yourself and others safe? Here are some ideas to help you.
*Take a deep breath before you feel your heart slows back down again.
*Count to ten slowly in your mind before you open your mouth. Count to another ten if you are still feeling out of control. Stop and think about what to say and do, then make a good choice.
*Walk away the place that makes you angry and go somewhere else until you've thought about what you can do.
*Use your words to tell your feelings. You should never hurt someone with your hands, feet or by what you say.
*Say what you say in a strong voice, not a loud shouting voice.
*Doing a chore that you really hate is a pretty good idea. It can keep your anger away and you can feel good about getting that chore done too. In this way, you make anger useful.",middle4956.txt
