0,D,"[""Douglas Fairbanks' first winning of an Academy Award"", 'the first time Oscar got its name', 'the first time the Awards were kept secret', ""Janet Gaynor's recognition as Best Actress""]","May 16, 1929 marks   _  .","The yearly Academy Awards ceremony was once a private affair. Now, because of television, it is very much a public affair. Hundreds of people gather in Hollywood to see the Oscars presented to outstanding actors, and others involved in the motion picture industry. Millions more watch on television. 
It all began on May 16, 1929, when 270 men and women sat down to dinner at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. There was no secret about the winners. The names of the winners had been known for months. Janet Gaynor, for example, had won as Best Actress. Douglas Fairbanks presented her with the famous gold statue . The little statue was not then called Oscar. Like a new actor, Oscar was unknown. About six years later, it somehow got that renowned name. A number of explanations have been offered for its origin, but nobody knows the true story for certain. 
Nowadays the results of the Oscar voting are kept secret. Only two people know the winners before the names are announced at the ceremony. The counting of votes is not done by one group of people but by different groups. Nobody except two members of an accounting  company sees the final results. 
The information is not kept in open files. Winners' names are placed in closed envelopes. The accountants each carry a complete set of envelopes to the ceremony. One set is simply a spare to be used in case something happens to the other one.",high24006.txt
