The river was overflowing its banks. So it was very dangerous to cross it on a horse. Each man was fighting for his life! Then another traveler came and he wanted to cross it, too. But he didn't have a horse. He watched the group and then asked Jefferson to take him. Jefferson agreed immediately. The man climbed on. After they were both safe to the other side of the river, someone asked the man, ""Why did you ask present for help? Did you know him?"" The man was shocked because he didn't know Jefferson was the president. ""All I know,"" he said, ""on some of your faces were written the answer NO, but there was the answer YES on his face.""",middle132.txt
