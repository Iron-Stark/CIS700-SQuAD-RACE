The tree frog is hard to find. It can change colors. On green leaves, it stays green. On a brown branch ,it turns brown. Some tree frogs can change from green to gold  or blue.
Tree frogs have legs and wide feet. They have sticky pads  at the end of their toes. These sticky toe pads keep the tree frogs from falling off the trees. Tree frogs have different colors and markings  on their skins. Their eyes are different, too. Some have green eyes, and others have bright red ones.
The sounds they make are different, too. One frog makes a sound like a dog barking .Another frog makes a loud noise like a snore .There is even a frog that whistles !",middle8199.txt
