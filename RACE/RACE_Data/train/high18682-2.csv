2,D,"['He is a rich man.', 'He does it on purpose.', 'He is a fool.', 'He likes to drink very much.']",What can we know about the drunk from the story?,"A drunk walks into a bar and says to the waiter, ""Waiter, buy everyone in the house a drink, pour yourself one, and give me the bill.""
So the waiter does just that and hands the man a bill for $57. The drunk says, ""I haven't got it.""
The waiter slaps the guy around a few times, then throws him out into the street.
The very next day the same drunk walks into the bar and once again says, ""Waiter, buy everyone in the house a drink, pour yourself one, and give me the bill.""
The waiter looks at the guy and figures _ to _ himself that he can't possibly be stupid enough to play the same trick twice, so he gives him the benefit of the doubt, pours a round of drinks for the house, has a drink himself and hands the drunk a bill for $57. The drunk says, ""I haven't got it.""
The waiter can't believe it. He picks the guy up, beats the living daylights out of him, then throws him out into the street.
The next day the same drunk walks back into the same bar and says, ""Waiter, buy everyone in the house a drink and give me the bill."" In disgust  , the waiter says, ""What? No drink for me this time?""
The drunk replies, ""You? No way! You get too violent when you drink.""",high18682.txt
