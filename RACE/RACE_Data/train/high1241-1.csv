The Department of  Fisheries and Oceans has developed guidelines for whale watching in Johnstone Strait,where killer whales are found on a daily basis each summer. It is strongly recommended that vessel operators follow these guidelines for all kinds of whales.
* Approach whales from the side, not from the front or the back.
* Approach no closer than 100 metres, then stop the boat but keep the engine on.
* Keep noise levels down-no horns, whistles or racing of engines.
* Start your boat only after the whales are more than 100 metres from your vessel.
* Leave the area slowly, gradually moving faster when you are more than 300 metres from the whales.
* Approach and leave slowly, avoiding sudden changes in speed or direction.
* Avoid disturbing groups of resting whales.
* Keep at low speeds and remain in the same direction if travelling side by side with whales.
* When whales are travelling close to shore, avoid crowding them near the shore or coming between the whales and the shore.
* Limit the time spent with any group of whales to less than 30 minutes at a time when within 100 to 200 metres of whales.
* If there is more than one vessel at the same observation spot, be sure to avoid any boat position that would result in surrounding the whales.
* Work together by communicating with other vessels, and make sure that all operators are aware of the whale watching guidelines.",high1241.txt
