I thought I might as well take the chance to see as much of the country as I could, but it was difficult to travel around Nepal. The hospital let me have a few days' holiday, so I decided to go into the forest and I asked a Nepalese guide, Damal Rai, to go with me. 
We started preparing for the trip at six in the morning, and let two elephants carry our equipment. It was hot, but Kamal made me wear shoes and trousers to protect me from snakes. In the forest there was a lot of wildlife, but we were trying to find big cats, especially tigers. We climbed onto the elephants' backs to get a better view, but it is unusual to find tigers in the afternoon because they sleep in the heat of the day.
Then in the distance, we saw a tiger, and Kamal told me to be very quiet. We crept near and found a dead deer, still bleeding. This was the tiger's lunch! Suddenly I started to feel very frightened.
We heard the tiger a second before we saw it. It jumped out like a flash of lightning, five hundred kilos plus and four metres long. I looked into its eyes and face, and saw right down the animal's throat. It grabbed Kamal's leg between its teeth, but I managed to pull Kamal away. One of our elephants ran at the tiger and made it go back into the grass. So we quickly escaped to let the tiger eat its lunch. That night it was impossible to sleep.",high22032.txt
