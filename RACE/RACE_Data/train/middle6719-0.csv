From the right moment
I was crazy about you.
A love so deep I gave you my all --
From my mind & body
To my spi rit & soul .
As a six-year-old boy
Deeply in love with you
I never saw the end of the tunnel.
I only saw myself
Running out of one.
And so I ran.
I ran up and down every playground
I gave you my heart
Because it came with so much more.
I played through the sweat  and hurt
Not because challenge  called me
But because YOU called me.
I did everything for YOU.
You gave a six-year-old boy his dream
And I'll always love you for it.
Love you always.
