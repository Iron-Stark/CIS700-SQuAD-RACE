2,B,"['show you how to find a better job', 'show you a special way to find a job', 'teach you the skills of making telephone calls', ""tell you it's not easy to find a good job""]",The purpose of the passage is to   _  .,"Sometimes you need to make phone calls to get a job. Calling is the first step where you can show your ability to an employer. Here are some tried and true tips:
Get the person responsible
You need to talk directly to the person who would supervise you. In a small business, you might ask to speak to the ""person in charge"". In a larger one, you would ask for the name of the person in charge of the particular department you're interested in.
Get the name of the person
If you don't have the name of the person you need to speak to, ask for it. Usually, you will be given the supervisor's name and your call will be transferred to him or her.
Get past the receptionist
In some cases, receptionists and secretaries will try to screen out your call. If they find out that you're looking for a job, they may transfer you to the Personnel Department or ask you to send an application or resume. Here are some ways to keep from getting screened out:
* Call back
Call back a day later and say you are getting ready to send some correspondence   to the person who manages such and such. You want to use the correct name and title and request that they give you this information. And this approach usually gets you what you need. Say ""thank you"" and call back in a day or so. Then ask for the supervisor or manager by name.
* Call when the secretary is out
You are likely to get right through if you call when the receptionist is out to lunch. Other good times are just before and after normal work hours. Less experienced staff members are likely to answer the phone and put you right through.
Ask three times for an interview
Sometimes, the supervisor you contact just simply rejects you. Then, you can try asking three times for an interview! Although this approach does not always work, asking the third time works more often than most people would believe.
Arrange a time
If the person agrees to an interview, arrange a specific date and time.",high22544.txt
