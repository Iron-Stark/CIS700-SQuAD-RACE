0,D,"['Yes.', 'No.', 'Glad.', 'Yes or No.']",What does shaking one's head mean all over the world?,"The idea of what shaking the head means is not always the same in different countries. Maybe some visitors would be surprised when they first come to India. When they talk to an Indian, they would find he would often shake his head. The visitors might think that the Indian doesn't like what they say. But in fact, they would be completely wrong.
Indians always shake their heads when they talk to others. It doesn't mean ""No"". If someone wants to visit India, he should know this, or he will be in trouble.
One day, a foreign officer went to India on business. He hired a car and asked an Indian to drive him. When he told his driver to take him to his office, the Indian shook his head at once. The officer said again and the driver shook his head again. At last the officer, of course, got angry.
""How dare you refuse my order?"" he shouted, ""Drive me to my office at once!""
The driver answered in quite a loud voice, too. ""Yes, sir!"" But to the officer's surprise, the driver shook his head at the same time.
The car started and the foreign officer was now too surprised to say a word. He thought about it for a while, and then he nodded with a smile, ""'No' means 'Yes' here!""",middle3048.txt
