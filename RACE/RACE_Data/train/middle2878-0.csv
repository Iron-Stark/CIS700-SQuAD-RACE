Many bloggers are teens who've been logging   onto sites to talk about anything in their lives. Many of today's teenagers are not afraid to openly discuss everything in their lives. Teens complain about parents and homework. They share diaries, post songs from the latest bands and show pictures of theirs. They write their own poems  , say something about their girlfriends or boyfriends and complain to each other or offer support. But mostly they just write down what they do every day.

They are using language that is surprising to their parents. Besides hearing from their friends, teen bloggers also get messages from strangers. Most of the time, it's older men asking to meet teenage girls. ""These strange men are dangerous for my kids. They sometimes teach my kids bad words,"" said Cara Cabral, a mother of two.
