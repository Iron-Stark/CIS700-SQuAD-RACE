Ninety-nine pupils were killed in a flood in Heilongjiang Province on June 10, 2005. They were swept away by violent waters while having class. It was a natural disaster. But the destruction may have been less serious if students had known what to do to save themselves. Some witnesses said most children did nothing but cry when they found no escape route. Under the instruction of teachers, some pupils caught desks and chairs that were floating and survived. But others were so scared that they could not follow what the teachers said.
Everyone knows that people should mend the fold before the sheep are lost. Preparation for disasters is very important. Schools should be responsible for teaching students survival skills for times of danger. So survival skills and exercises are as important as textbook knowledge.
Japan has set a good example to us. Even though earthquakes and tsunamis often affect the country, there are usually few deaths and injuries. Survival exercises are held in every Japanese school every year. With different kinds of competitions and training, schools help the students be aware and capable of surviving disasters.
On June 16, 2005, a public safety museum opened in Beijing. People can experience disaster like fires and earthquakes, and learn survival skills.
