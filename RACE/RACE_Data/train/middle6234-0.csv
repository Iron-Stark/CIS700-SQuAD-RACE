0,D,"['Beautiful.', 'Interesting.', 'Bad', 'Beautiful and interesting.']",How are Jimmy's pictures?,"Once there is a boy in London. His name is Jimmy. He starts painting when he is three years old, and when he is five years old, he is already very good at it. He paints many beautiful and interesting pictures, and a lot of people buy his pictures. They say, ""This boy is going to be famous when he's a little older, and then we're going to sell these pictures for a lot of money.""
Jimmy's pictures are different from others' because he never paints on the whole of the paper. He only paints on half of it, and the other half is always empty.
""That's very clever,"" people say. ""No other painters have ever done that!""
One day someone asks Jimmy, ""Please tell me, Jimmy, why do you only paint on the bottom   half of the paper, but not on the top half?""
""Because I'm small,"" Jimmy says, ""and my brushes can't reach very high.""",middle6234.txt
