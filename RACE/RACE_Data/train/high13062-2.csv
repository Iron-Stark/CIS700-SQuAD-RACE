2,D,"['I will become a millionaire in one month.', 'I want to be the champion of the marathon.', 'I will change all of my bad habits in one week.', 'I will go for a walk after supper in working days.']","According to the passage, which of the following is the best plan?","During these past few days I have been reflecting a lot on everything that happened this past year and thinking of what I can do differently so that the coming year will be much better! Here I want to share some tips so you can also do your resolution and you can achieve them all!
*Be realistic: You should always try to reach for the skies with your goals, but things like ""I want to win the lottery "" or ""I want to lose 80 pounds in 1 month"" are things you shouldn't have on your list because they will only become frustrations.
*Be detailed: It's a lot easier to accomplish more specific plans than general ones. Instead of writing ""I want to lose weight,"" put things like ""I will start my Yes You Can! Diet Plan the first Monday of the year"" or ""I will start a movement routine 3 times a week for 35 minutes."" When we put down concrete activities, we _ ourselves to them and it becomes a lot harder to come up with excuses.
*Think of alternatives: At the beginning of this past year, you put that you were going to start going to the gym as one of your annual plans. During the whole year you intended to take action but you always said that you couldn't because you came home so tired from work. If this is one of your plans for this year, you should write down how you're going to achieve it. For example, ""I will start going to the gym in the mornings, before work."" That way you prevent what stopped you from achieving your goal last year.
*Focus on goals which depend on YOU: It is very important that all of your plans are for YOU to accomplish, and it is important that you write them down that way. If one of your goals this coming year is to improve a relationship with one of your family members, make sure that you clearly put down what you are going to do for this to succeed. For example, ""I will call my sister at least three times a week and I will visit her in the middle of the year.""
Well, I hope that you use these tips so that this year you will accomplish everything you want, and make it the best year ever! Thank you for being with me during everything this past year, and I hope that you keep showing me all of this love and support during the next. Happy new year!",high13062.txt
