New York: When the first jet struck Tower 1 at World Trade Center at 8: 48 am on Tuesday, the people in Tower 2 at World Trade Center with a view of the instant damage across the divide had the clearest sense of what they too must do : get out fast.
Katherine Ilachinski, who had been knocked off her chair by the blast of heat exploding from the neighboring tower, was one of those. Despite her 70 years of age, Ms Ilachinski, an architect working on the 91st floor of Tower 2 at World Trade Center, the south tower, went for the stairs. Twelve floors above her, Judy Wein, a manager, screamed and set off too.
But others up and down the 110 floors, many without clear views of the damage across the way and thus unclear about what was happening, were not so sure. And the 18 minutes before the next plane would hit were ticking off.
Among the uncertainty about what was the best thing to do, formal announcements inside the south tower instructed people to _ , assuring them that the building was sound and the threat was limited to the other tower.
Some left, others stayed, some began to climb down and, when met with more announcements and other warning to stop or return, went back up. The decisions made in those instants proved to be of great importance, because many who chose to stay, were doomed   when the second jet crashed into the south tower killing many and stranding (...) many more in the floors above where the jet hit.
One of those caught in indecision  was the manager at Fuji Bank USA. Richard Jacobs of Fuji Bank left the 79th floor with the other office workers, but on the 48th floor they heard the announcement that the situation was under control. Several got in the lifts and went back up two minutes or so before the plane crashed into their floor.",high12683.txt
