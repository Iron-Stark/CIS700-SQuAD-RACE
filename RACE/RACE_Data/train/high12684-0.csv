I woke up around 6 : 30 this morning, on my ninth day in hospital since I caught SARS. Glancing over at my roommate, Xiao Huang, a 27-year-old employee of a Beijing software company, I saw he was also awake.
After a light breakfast, a nurse came in and took my temperature. It was 36.6 centigrade. We're at Changxindian Hospital in southwestern Beijing, a newly named SARS patient hospital. It seems I am now recovering as my fever has gone down in recent days. When I first got the disease , I spent four days with a temperature above 39.5 centigrade--at one point it reached 40. 1 centigrade.
At 8 : 30 am, a nurse took a blood sample and X-ray of my chest. Then my daily treatment began with the help of the experts from Guangdong and WHO.
Before the first bottle finished, my wife rang me. I talked with her on my mobile phone. It has become a major connection with the outside world. Several friends also called me in the morning.
I am feeling great these days--no fever, no headache and no pain in the chest, which are all symptoms of SARS. My slight cough is gone since I began taking a new round of medicines yesterday. The doctor told me that I may be set free from hospital in two weeks and a half.",high12684.txt
