0,C,"['herself', 'nobody', 'her boyfriend', 'everybody']",The girl liked    _    before she was able to see.,"Once, there was a beautiful girl who didn't like herself, because she was blind, she couldn't see anything.
In fact, the girl loved nobody except her boyfriend, for he was always ready to help her. She used to tell her boyfriend, ""If I could see the world, I would marry you.""
One day, someone donated a pair of eyes to the girl. When the
came off,she was able to see
everything, including her boyfriend for the first time. He asked her, ""Now that you can see the world, will you
marry me?"" The girl looked at her boyfriend and was greatly surprised to see that he was blind, too. She had never expected that, and she would not like to be with a blind husband for the rest of her life, so she refused to marry him.
Her boyfriend left in tears and a few days later wrote a note to her, saying, ""My dear, take good care of your eyes. Before they are yours, they were mine.""
So, this is how the human brain often works when our situation changes. Only a very few remember what life was like before. And we often ask for more than we need. Life is a gift. Today, before you complain about the taste of your food,think of those who have nothing to eat. Before you complain about life,think of some ones who went to heaven too early. Before you complain about your old house, think of the people who are living in the streets. And when you are tired and complain about your job, think of those who have no jobs.
In a word, enjoy the things you have and don't forget your past.
