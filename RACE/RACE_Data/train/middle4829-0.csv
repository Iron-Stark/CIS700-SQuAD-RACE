One of the children was Jessica McClure. She was 18 months old. Jessica's mother, who worked at the day care center, was watching the children. Suddenly Jessica fell and disappeared.

""We can't go into the well. "" they said ""It's too narrow. So, we're going to drill  a hole next to the well. Then we 'll drill a tunnel across Jessica. Then we'll bring her up through the hole. ""
