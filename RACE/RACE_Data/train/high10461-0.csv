*Set a regular time and place for study. This will save your time in the long run. If you have a study hall in your school, use it!
*Use daylight hours to study whenever possible. For most people for every hour of study done in daylight hours, it will take them one and a half hours to do the same task at night.
*Take breaks. Don't plan marathon study time. Have a short rest before you study again.
*By using flash cards or summary sheets, you can use odd times to study while you're waiting for class to start or for a friend to pick you up.
*If possible, plan study time with a partner. Choose your partner wisely however. Make sure you study, not socialize.
