2,C,"[""doesn't know the time."", ""doesn't tell people the time."", 'wants to sleep.', 'sleeps well.']",Joe   _  .,"Joe is a taxi driver. Now, after working for a long time, he is very tired. So he lies down on the chair in his car, and wants to have a sleep.
But a man comes up to his car, and asks, ""Excuse me, what's the time, please?""
Joe is a little unhappy ,but he looks at his watch ,and says, ""It's 10:15.""
The man thanks Joe and goes away. Joe says to himself, ""Now I can go back to sleep again.""
But at 10:20,another man comes up and asks the same question, "" Excuse me, sir, what's the time, please?""
Joe can't sleep again. He has to tell his man the time. In ten minutes, four people come to his car and ask the time. He is very friendly, but he wants to sleep. So he writes ""I don't know the time."" on a piece of paper and puts the paper outside the window of his car.""Now no one will come and ask me the time.""
But he is wrong! Look, another man is coming up to his car. He is knocking loudly at the window of Joe's car. Joe wakes up. The man says, ""It's 10:50 now, sir!""",middle6652.txt
