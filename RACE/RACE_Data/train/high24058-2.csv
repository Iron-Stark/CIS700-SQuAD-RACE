2,B,"['It is the first time that Daniel Craig has played Bond.', 'The film Skyfall will be released later than planned.', 'Daniel Craig receives little attention from movie fans.', 'Quantum of Solace has made the most money so far.']",What can we learn from the text?,"Details of the latest James Bond film Skyfall have been shown to the public. It comes 50 years to the day after actor Sean Connery first played Bond -- the superspy in Dr No.
    The new film, known at the moment only as Bond 23, will be the third to star Daniel Craig as the secret agent  . Other names in the cast include Albert Finney, Javier Bardem and Ralph Fiennes.
    British film-maker Sam Mendes, who won an Oscar for American Beauty, will direct the latest adventure.
    Ajay Chowdhury, from the James Bond International Fan Club, said, ""Daniel Craig's third time as 007 has been looked forward to by Bond fans around the world. The fans have been made to wait extra long for this film since the global economic crisis   delayed the film for some time.""
    ""Mendes has an unusual way of directing, and with the acting gift and the precedent   set by the previous two films in which Craig played Bond, Skyfall promises a Bond film where the sky may not be the limit.""
    It is reported that the film will send 007 to South Africa and India to hunt for a criminal   organization. Other reported locations for filming include Duntrune Castle, near Lochgilphead in Argyll, Scotland, which is believed to be the spy's home.
    The film is set to be released in the UK this October.
    Craig' s performance as Bond gave new life to the film series, leading to the highest ever 007 box office   takings of PS367 million for his role in Casino Royale in 2006. Quantum of Solace, the most recent film in the series released in 2008, made PS353 million.",high24058.txt
