3,B,"['Hard -working', 'Clever', 'Warmly -hearted', 'Strange']",Which of the following words can best describe Mum?,"It was a cloudy day on November 11, 2015. We walked in so quietly that the nurse at the desk didn't even lift her eyes from the book. Mum pointed at a big chair by the door and I knew she wanted me to sit down. While I watched, mouth open in surprise, Mum took off her hat and coat and gave them to me to hold. She walked quietly to the small room by the lift and took out a wet mop  . She pushed the mop past the desk and as the nurse looked up, Mum nodded and said, ""Very dirty floors.""
""Yes, I'm glad they've finally decided to clean them,"" the nurse answered. She looked at Mum strangely and said, ""But aren't you working late?""
Mum just pushed harder, each swipe of the mop taking her farther and farther down the hall. I watched until she was out of sight and the nurse had turned back to writing in the big book.
After a long time Mum came back. Her eyes were shining. She quickly put the mop back and took my hand. As we turned to go out of the door, Mum nodded politely to the nurse and said, ""Thank you.""
Outside, Mum told me, ""Dagma is fine. No fever. ""
""You see her, Mum?""
""Of course. I told her about the hospital rules, and she will not expect us until tomorrow. Dad will stop worrying as well. It's a fine hospital. But the floors! A mop is no good. You need a brush. """,high11364.txt
