1,D,"['ill', 'dead', 'asleep', 'lost']","After a few drinks, the cowboy found his horse  _  .","One day a strong cowboy was traveling on his horse when he saw a bar. He decided to stop for a few drinks, so he tied  his horse outside the bar, walked into the bar and ordered two bottles of beer. This cowboy was new in town. He looked around and noticed some people making faces to him. He guessed that they might play some tricks   on him, but he said nothing and continued to drink. After drinking, he walked out of the bar and found his horse lost.
However, he kept calm, came back into the bar, and said slowly, "" I don't know what you fools did to my horse out there... but I'm leaving in five minutes, and by then if my horse isn't back where it's supposed to be, well ... I have to do here what I did in Texas!"" The cowboy added, ""And I don't want to do what I did in Texas!"" After hearing these words, the other customers seemed a little bit frightened.
The cowboy went back to his seat and ordered another two bottles of beer. After five minutes, he walked out and found his horse tied where it was supposed to be.
Just as he was leaving, the boss of the bar came up and asked curiously   , ""What was the thing that you did in Texas but you didn't want to do here?""
The cowboy turned to the boss and replied in a low voice, "" I had to walk home!""
