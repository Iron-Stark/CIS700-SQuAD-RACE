        TeleNav Talks. You drive. Voice and Onscreen Directions.
        TeleNav is easy to use. As you drive, TeleNav GPS Navigator will give you all the information you need, such as:
        *The current street.
        *The next turn to take.
        *The next street to turn onto.
        *The distance remaining before next turn.
        *The number of miles left on your trip.
        Along the way, directions will be announced in a clear voice and displayed on your phone. For example, it will say, ""Go 1.2 miles and turn right on Elm Street."" As you approach the turn, you will hear, ""Turn right on Elm Street."" TeleNav GPS Navigator will even tell you that the destination is on your left-or right-hand side of the street.
