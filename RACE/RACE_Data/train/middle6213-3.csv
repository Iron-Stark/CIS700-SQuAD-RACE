3,C,"['Father and Daughter', 'A Difficult Moment', 'Wish You Enough', 'A Trip Back Home']","The best title of the passage may be ""  _  .""","Many people have great difficulty in saying goodbye. But from goodbye moments, we can always learn something.
Once, I overheard   a father and daughter in their goodbye moment. The father said, ""I love you, I wish you enough."" The daughter answered, ""Daddy, our life together has been more than enough. Your lover is all that I need. I wish you enough, too, Daddy.""
They kissed and she left ...
The father walked over towards me. I could see he wanted and needed a cry. He came over to me and asked, ""Did you ever say a forever goodbye to someone?"" Before I could answer, he went on, "" I am old and she lives much too far away. I know her next trip back would be for my funeral  .""
""When you were saying goodbye I heard you say, 'I wish you enough.' May I ask what that means?""
He began to smile , ""It's a wish that has come down from my great-great-grandparents. And my parents used to say it to me.""
He stopped for a moment and looked up as if trying to remember it. He smiled even more.
""When we said'I wish you enough,' we were wanting the other person to have a life full of enough good things.""
Then, turning towards me, he shared   the following ""wish"" from his heart.
I wish you enough sun to keep you bright .
I wish you enough rain to appreciate the sun more.
I wish you enough happiness to keep you alive.
I wish you enough pain so that the smallest joys in life appear much bigger.
I wish enough hellos to get you through the final goodbye.
My friends, I wish you enough.",middle6213.txt
