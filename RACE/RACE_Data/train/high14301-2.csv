2,A,"['Beauty Is Not Just Skin Deep.', 'Beauty Is Just Skin Deep.', 'Beauty Never Stays Forever.', 'A World-famous Beauty expert']",What would be the best title for the passage?  _,"Her attractive lips seemed to speak words of kindness, while her eyes appeared to seek  out the good in people. ""You have two hands, one for helping yourself, the other for helping others."" She used to say.
It was for this rare charm and inner beauty that British movie star Audrey Hepburn (1929-1993) was named the most naturally beautiful woman of all time in June, 2004.
""Her skin looks fresh in all her films and her warm and lively personality really shines through,"" said one beauty expert.
Life was never easy for Hepburn. Shortly after her parents' painful divorce when she was nine, she found herself in the Netherlands at the start of World War II. Hepburn watched helplessly as several of her relatives were killed. She survived by eating tulip bulbs and carried secret messages for the resistance in her ballet shoes.
She dreamed of becoming a ballet dancer but was told she was too tall and not talented enough to be a success.
Hepburn then turned to musicals and spent most of her time as a chorus girl  . She had some small movie roles but it was not until Roman Holiday (1953) that she became a star. With her good manners and delicate figure, she was perfect in the role of a European princess. She took the Best Actress Oscar for her performance.
In 1988 Hepburn began her most important role--as a Goodwill Ambassador  for UNICEF(United Nations Children's Fund). She traveled to the poorest places, doing her best to provide care and create awareness of the difficult situations in which some children live.
When Hepburn passed away, a message displayed at her funeral read, ""In losing Audrey,
the world not only lost a movie star, we lost a princess, an angel, a person who inspired us all and whose selfless and loving examples shall always be remembered.""",high14301.txt
