2,B,"['there are 200 houses in Yinxu', 'many things are still to be dug out', 'Anyang is a city of the Shang Dynasty', 'no research has been carried out on Yinxu']",We can infer from the passage that   _  .,"Yinxu (Ruins of Yin) is the ruins of the last capital of China's Shang Dynasty (1600 BC - 1046 BC). The capital served 255 years for 12 kings. It shows the golden age of early Chinese culture, crafts and science, a time of great prosperity   during the Chinese Bronze Age  .
Discovered in 1899, Yinxu is one of the oldest and largest archeological sites   in China and is one of the historical capitals of China and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It lies in central Henan Province, near the modern city of Anyang, and is open to the public as the Garden Museum of Yinxu. It is famous as the source of oracle bone script  , the earliest recorded form of Chinese writing. The oracle bone script has recorded almost everything from dream-explaining to events such as harvests, birth of a child, the weather and the success of military campaigns.
Over 3,000 tombs, 2,200 pits, and 200 houses have been dug out at Yinxu. The large number of burial accessories found there shows the high level of the Shang crafts industry.
The site includes a main palace and an ancient tomb. Besides, there are a number of large buildings, at least 53 of which have been dug out.
Yinxu has seen many years of research, first researched by the Academia Sinica in the late 1920s to the early 1930s and most recently by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.",high5537.txt
