3,D,"['The father should let the son alone.', 'The father should give his son a beating.', 'The father should allow his son his freedom.', 'The father should be patient enough to have communication with the son.']",What do you think is the possible answer for the father?,"Dear Mr Zhu,
I am writing to your magazine's ""Teenagers Now"" column  to ask for some help with my 16-year-old son. At the moment, he refuses to do almost everything his mother and I ask him to do. He is our only child and we treat him very well. His grandparents buy him many things, and yet he is still rude to us. He refuses to spend time with us or do as we tell him. Sometimes he acts as if he doesn't even love us at all.
Now he refuses to do his homework, and instead insists on wasting his time watching DVDs and listening to foreign music. I cannot understand this music, but I don't like it. He also spends too much time in Internet cafes, where he either plays games or chats online. He is wasting valuable time during this important period in his life!
What am I to do? At present, to prevent making his mother unhappy with an argument, I am allowing him his freedom. However, I am worried that if I keep allowing him to do what he wants, he may fail at school, or worse.
How can I help my son without harming our relationship?
Yours
