The ""cavity  pose"" is said to make the model's face appear attractive, slimmer and smaller, which is considered more beautiful in Japan. The craze is sweeping Japanese social media, as well as fashion magazine front covers.
Just recently a model of a popular culture magazine, NYLON, did a pose which looked as if she had toothache. Twitter user, Okoge, spotted it among a range of similar magazines, with front cover models all doing the same pose. Okoge posted photos of the front cover models all with the exact same toothache pose, on the social media site, writing, ""Does everyone have cavities?"" The image has since been re-tweeted more than 35,000 times, but this is anything but an isolated incident . Twitter and Instagram are going crazy for the pose, too.
The name, which means cavity pose, is called ""mushiba no poozu"" or ""mushibapoozu"" in Japanese. Some people also refer to it as the"" mushibagaitaipoozu"", the ""cavity hurts pose"", ""mushibamitainapoozu"" or ""looks like a cavity pose"", or even, ""mushibaninattapoozu"" or ""I got a cavity pose"".
According to the magazine, Kotaku, such photographs first appeared on Twitter last year in Japan. Many Japanese people said they are doing the cavity pose. And in only a few weeks, the trend has spread to art, popular cartoons and even national magazines.
There have been more and more photos cropping up online from earlier this year, but whether the trend will stand the test of time remains to be seen.",high12883.txt
