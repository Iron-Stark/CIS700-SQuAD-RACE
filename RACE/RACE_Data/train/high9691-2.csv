2,A,"['The tri-tip, your right choice', 'Differences between tri-tip and tofu', 'Tofu, a nutritious soy food', 'Best food partner -- Tri-tip and tofu']",The best title of the passage is   _  .,"Whenever someone begins to talk to me about how horrible it is to eat meat and suggests that a nice piece of tofu would be just as good, I just smile and show them those nice pointy teeth we all have in the corners of our mouths. They are called canines  , and they are there only for the purpose of eating meat.
When it comes to satisfying this kind of desire, soy   food can never match a well-prepared tri-tip (also know as triangle beef steak ). Just the thought of the beef, burning on the grill   with the smell of wood smoke gets the mouth watering and brings back memories of summer barbecues. When the knife cuts through the tri- tip, exposing the red meat bursting with juices, it's more than just cooking. It's a cultural event, showing we are at the top of the food chain, like no other food can.
Nutritionally speaking, the tri-tip is one of the better cuts of beef. It is lower in fat than many other cuts, and the proteins   you get from eating meat are more complete than those that come from vegetables, making meat a better choice for building and keeping up your muscle tissue healthy.
According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, one thing to be aware of with soy products in general is that while they are high in iron, a necessary mineral for the body, they also contain something that blocks the body's absorption of iron. We can cook them in various ways to make them tasty. Anyway, the tri-tip goes a lot better with ice-cold beer than a large piece of bean-curd cheese would, no matter how you cook it.
I guess I should say at least
e good thing about tofu. If you cook it just right, you can make it taste a little like the tri-tip, but only a little.",high9691.txt
