2,C,"['their teachers affect them', 'their classmates affect them', 'newspapers and online news affect them', 'the forum affects them']",The main reason that China in their eyes is usually negative is probably that   _  .,"About 400 high school students from Western Pennsylvania and the neighboring state of Ohio joined a heated discussion recently on ""China: What Does the Future Hold?""
    ""It's either going to turn out really good or really bad - who knows?"" said Braveen Ragunathan, a senior from an Ohio high school. In his mind all Americans are connected to China in some way.

    Elliott Blackwell, a junior at the Neighborhood Academy, said the forum let him know more about how China's economic development will affect America in the future.
    Some students, although impressed by China's economic boom, expressed uneasiness about the nation's practices and differences from the American way of doing business and politics.
    ""China is a power coming up,so they might challenge us,"" Paul Amon, a junior from Oil City High School, said. ""I'd hope that China can be our partner but I think that we'd clash   along the way because we're too different,"" he added.
    George Riley, a teacher explained: ""The view of China is usually negative   and I think that's fueled by the media.""
    However, some negative feelings are not from the media. Merri Ebel is a senior at East Allegheny High School north of Pittsburgh. Both her parents lost their jobs recently. The company they worked for said it was cheaper to produce goods in China rather than the US.
    ""China is just this big question mark. China was just a big country with millions of people that no one really knew about because it was so far away and our class was more American history based,"" she said.
    For better or worse US teenagers are eager to know more about China, the forum shows.",high17342.txt
