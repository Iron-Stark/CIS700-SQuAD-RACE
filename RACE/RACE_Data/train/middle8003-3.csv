3,A,"['They watch.', 'They eat.', 'They listen to the teacher.', 'They just learn by themselves.']",How do kids get knowledge?,"Food is very important.Everyone needs to eat well if he wants to have a strong body.Our minds also need a kind of food.This kind of food is knowledge .
When we are very young,we start getting knowledge.Kids like watching and listening.Color pictures especially interest them.When kids are older,they enjoy reading.When something interests them,they love to ask questions.
Our minds,like our bodies,always need the best food.Studying on our own brings the most knowledge.
If someone is always telling us answers,we never learn well.When we study correctly and get knowledge on our own,we learn more and understand better.",middle8003.txt
