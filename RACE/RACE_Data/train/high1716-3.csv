3,A,"['Just be yourself', 'Do nothing by halves', 'Helping others is a virtue', 'Where there is a will, there is a way']","According to the passage, which of the following conclusions can we get?","One morning, Charley, a little green frog, was sitting in a pond  by the side of the road.
Wanda, the neighborhood witch , was walking along the road. She was a good witch and dreamt to become a fairy godmother who can save people from trouble with magic powers. Wanda had been learning fairy godmother magic for 103 years. That morning, she decided to try the magic she had learned and bring happiness to others.
Seeing Wanda, Charley cried, ""Hi, Wanda.""
""Hi, Charley,"" replied Wanda, ""I have a surprise for you.""
Then, Wanda waved her wand , said a magic word, and Charley turned into a prince!
When Charley-turned-prince looked at himself in the water, he cried, ""Hey! You turned me into a prince! It's a surprise all right, but I don't want to be a prince! Change me back right now!""
""Oh, dear,"" Wanda said. ""you shouted so loud that I forgot the way to change you back. But who wouldn't rather be a prince?""
""I wouldn't!"" cried Charley. ""I want to be a frog!"" He stuck out his tongue, missing a bug   flying by the end of his nose. ""Look at that, Wanda! I was a good fly catcher. But now, this tongue is too short! Please change me back!""
""I can't, Charley. But you'll learn to be happy as a prince."" She waved her wand, and suddenly a castle appeared. Out of the castle dozens of musicians were playing various instruments. ""Charley! You'll have servants, eat delicious foods, and you can sing and dance and snap fingers .""
""No!"" Charley interrupted.  ""I don't want all these! I want bugs!"" Charley cried. ""I don't want to sing and dance! And why would I do something as silly as snapping my fingers?""
""Snapping fingers!"" cried out Wanda. ""That's what I forgot!"" She snapped her fingers, cried ""Upsi-doodle!"" and the castle and musicians disappeared and the prince became a little green frog.""
Charley looked at himself in the water. "" _ , Wanda. Oh, happy day! I'm a frog.""
""I must apologize, Charley,"" Wanda said, ""you are a happy frog. I should know this a moment ago.""",high1716.txt
