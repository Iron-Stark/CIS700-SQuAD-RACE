1,C,"['He was rude and liked fighting.', 'He was famous for his bad temper.', 'He lost his job and felt terrible that day.', ""He tried to get the author' s parking space.""]",What do we know about the yellow car' s driver?,"One night my wife and I were going to dinner at a friend ' s.As we went towards the house, I noticed a car pulling out from the sidewalk.Just ahead, another car was waiting to back into the parking space.But before he could do so a yellow car came up from behind and sneaked into the space.
While my wife went ahead into our friend' s house, I stepped into the street. 
""Hey,"" I said, ""this parking space belongs to that guy."" I gestured towards the man ahead, who was looking back angrily.At that moment I was feeling pretty manly.
 "" Mind your own business!"" the driver told me.
 ""No,"" I said.""You don' t understand.That fellow was waiting to back into this space.""
 Things quickly heated up, until finally he jumped out of the car.My God, he was extremely large.He grabbed me and shook his rock of a fist at me.I tasted blood.I was terrified.
Almost in a panic, I ran to my friend ' s front door.As a former Marine   , as a man, I felt  ly embarrassed as my wife and friends asked me what had happened.All I could say was that I had had an argument about a parking space.They were sensitive and let it go at that.
Perhaps half an hour later, the doorbell rang.For some reason I was sure that the huge man had returned for me.My blood ran cold.My hostess got up to answer it, but I stopped her.I knew I had to face up to my fear.
I opened the door.There he stood.""I came back to apologize,"" he said in a low voice.""I am ashamed of myself.The Brooklyn Navy Yard where I've worked for ten years is closing.Today I got laid off.I' m not myself.I hope you' ll accept my apology.""
 I remembered that after I closed the door, I stood there for a few minutes alone with tears in my eyes.",high20027.txt
