2,A,"['The fruit we eat comes from many places in the country.', 'Orange trees are often planted near water.', 'The soil is about the same in all the states of the country.', 'The Americans like eating oranges and apples better than any other fruit.']",Which of the following does this passage make you believe?,"The United States is one of the greatest fruit-growing countries in the world. Fine red apples come from Washington and New York. Golden oranges come from Southern California and Florida. Fruit grows in all parts of America. The kind of fruit that is grown depends on the weather in each place.
Orange trees cannot be grown where temperatures drop below freezing. Southern California and Florida are far from each other, but their weather is much the same. They do not often have freezing temperatures.
In Washington, apple trees are planted near the Atlantic Ocean. In New York, they grow near the Great Lakes. Apple trees are often planted near water. Water temperature changes more slowly than land temperature. Near water, temperature does not drop so fast. There is less chance of frost in late spring or early autumn. Frost can kill apples.
America has many kinds of weather. It has many kinds of soil. Because of this, they grow and eat more fruit than any other country in the world.",middle4126.txt
