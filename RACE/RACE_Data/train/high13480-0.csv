0,D,"['Relying on rotating crops', 'The difficulty of planting crops', ""The US' melting pot culture"", ""The US' agricultural wealth""]",What has made American cuisine different from other cuisines according to the article?,"The ""melting pot"" in American cuisine(. ) is a myth, not terribly unlike the idea of a melting pot of American culture, notes chef Dan Barber. ""Most cultures don't think about their cuisine in such monolithic  terms,"" he says. ""French, Mexican, Chinese, and Italian cuisines each consist of dozens of distinct regional foods. And I think 'American' cuisine is moving in the same direction, becoming more localized, not globalized. ""
American cuisine is shaped by the natural wealth of the country. Having never faced agricultural hardship, Americans don't have to rely on rotating crops, such as the Japanese, whose food culture now showcases buckwheat   alongside rice, or the Indians, or the French and Italians, who feature beans alongside wheat. ""That kind of negotiation with the land forced people to incorporate  those crops in to the culture,"" says Barber. And so eating soba noodles becomes part of what it means to be Japanese, and eating beans becomes part of what it means to be French.
So if what we eat is what we are, what are Americans? Well, meat. ""If Americans have any unifying food identity, I would say we are a mostly white meat culture,"" says Barber. ""The protein-centric dinner plate, whether you're talking about a boneless chicken breast, or a 16-ounce steak, as an everyday expectation is something that America really created, and now exports to the rest of the world.""
Every single culture and religion uses food as part of their celebrations, says Ellen Gustafson, co-founder of the FEED Project and The 30 Project, which aims to deal with both hunger and overweight issues globally. ""The celebratory nature of food is universal. Every season, every harvest, and every holiday has its own food, and this is true in America as well. It helps define us.""",high13480.txt
