Twenty-eight eighth-graders at St. Matthew School in San Francisco will tell you it can still be rich and colorful.
These students took part in their school's ""tech-free"" challenge. They couldn't use cell phones for two weeks from Nov 11 to Nov 22.
The idea was to help students understand how technology has affected their lives, said Denise Uhl, principal of the school.
Uhl did a survey on technology usage among the eighth-graders before thinking of the challenge. She found that 84 percent of the students said they didn't like it ""when everyone was on their cell phones"", but they didn't know what to do about it. The answer was actually easy --- to stop constantly using cell phones.
To help students understand the point, Uhl created the activity. It was warmly welcomed among students.
""I wanted to sign up for the tech-free challenge because it was just really a good idea to do it,"" eighth-grader Joe told local newspaper Catholic San Francisco. ""I wanted to get closer to my family. And it really worked. I started to hang out with my family more. We watched more family movies and we played a lot of board games.""
The activity also helped students develop their interests.
