Could your cell phone give you cancer? Whether it could or not, some people are worrying about the possibility that phones, power lines and Wi-Fi could be responsible for a range of illnesses, from rashes to brain tumors.
Some say there is evidence to support the growing anxieties. David Carpenter, a professor of environmental health sciences at the university at Albany, in New York, thinks there's a greater than 95 percent chance that power lines can cause childhood leukemia . Also there's a greater than 90 percent chance that cell phones can cause brain tumors. ""It's apparent now that there's a real risk, "" said Carpenter.
But others believe these concerns are unjustified. Dr Martha Linet, the head of radiation epidemiology  at the US National Cancer Institute, has looked at the same research as Carpenter but has reached a different conclusion. ""I don't support warning labels for cell phones, "" said Linet. ""We don't have the evidence that there's much danger. ""
Studies so far suggest a weak connection between EMFs  and illness-- so weak that it might not exist at all. A multinational investigation of cell phones and brain cancer, in 13 countries outside the US, has been underway for several years. It's funded in part by the European Union, in part by a cell phone industry group. The final report should come out later this year, but data so far don't suggest a strong link between cell phone use and cancer risk.",high6321.txt
