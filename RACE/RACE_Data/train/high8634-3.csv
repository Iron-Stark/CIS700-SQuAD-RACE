3,D,"['Some similar habits between Americans and the British.', 'Different communicating ways between Americans and the British.', 'Different body languages between Americans and the British.', 'Some differences between American English and British English.']",What is the passage mainly about?,"Recently,I came across an interesting article on the differences between British English and American English. I had a lot of fun reading it and thinking of as many differences as I could as an American.
Their cars have ""bonnets "", while ourselves have ""hoods"". They park their cars in a ""car park"" while we leave ours in a ""parking lot"". Our ""cookies"" are their ""biscuits"", while their ""rubbers"" are our ""erasers"".
Then there are the food words. Would you want to eat something called ""Toad in the Hole"" or ""Bangers and Mash"" or ""Spotted Dick""? I'm here to report they are all very tasty. There are American equivalents ,of course. We've got ""Shoofly Pie"", ""Chicken Fried Steak"" and ""Mississippi Mud Pie"". What they call ""crisps"" is what we call ""potato chips"" and when we ask for ""chips"" in England we will get what we know at home in America as ""French fries"".
They find it _ that we call the ""toilet"" the ""bathroom"" and they really double over  with laughter when we ask for the ""restroom"". American ladies in England who ask for the ""little girl's room"" or the ""powder room"" will be met with blank stares. A ""fag"" is a ""cigarette"" in the UK, which can lead to endless confusion for British visitors looking for a cigarette in America. Americans on the other hand are endlessly confused by English signs put up over doorways saying ""Way Out"". We Americans walk on the sidewalk not the pavement. ""Pavement"" in America is the actual cement  the sidewalk is made of.",high8634.txt
