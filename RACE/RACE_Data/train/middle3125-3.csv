3,D,"['An invitation letter.', 'A thank-you letter.', 'A sorry letter.', 'A complaint letter.']",What kind of letter is it?,"Dear Sir,
I am writing to you about my stay at your hotel. My wife and I arrived on Saturday, May 15thand stayed for a week. Though we were treated well and found the service excellent, we think there are one or two things we should bring your attention.
1. We hoped for a nice holiday from our busy work lives, and your ad said ""comfortable and quiet"". We want to have a chance to enjoy ourselves. However, we were always waken up by the noise every morning. Is it really necessary for the workers to start their repair work so early?
2. We hoped to swim in your ""wonderful pool"". To our disappointment , we found that it was closed for the whole time of our stay.
I hope you do not mind my writing to you about these things, but I would be happy if you could give me some explanation . As I said at the start, it is a pity, and your service is so good in other places.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Yours sincerely
