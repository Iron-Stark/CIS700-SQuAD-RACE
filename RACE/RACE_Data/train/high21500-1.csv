1,C,"['tells the story of the first Christmas', 'started to be made in 2002', 'is the fourth of its series', 'will be shown on Christmas']","From the text,we know A Mammoth christmas  _  .","Every year,there have been the Christmas specials for almost every sitcom and cartoon,which nod in sincerity towards the holiday season.Since Charles Schultz,the American cartoonist who created Charlie Brown and Snoopy,first got his hit on the holiday with A Charlie Brown Christmas in 1965.characters from television and comic books have tried on the Christmas clothes.
This year,Fox has brought out its new""lce Age"":A Mammoth Christmas,which was first shown on Thanksgiving day.The ""Ice Age""films,which began in 2002,with a fourth feature for 2012,have been successful.one thing many fans would love the film is that they can have a chance to spend more time with the memorable animal characters from the series:Manny,Diego,and Sid.The film.tells the story of the birth of the Christmas tree,Santa'S deer,his sleigh and other things.    
It is also a""Christmas Must Be Saved"" story and a""You Must Believe""story.Like the other""Ice Age"" films,it involves a dangerous journey and time is found to cause sufferings to the poor little squirrel,Scrat.
Christmas has been tied on to""Ice Age""like antlers on to a dog.In fact,the film-makers  behind A Mammoth Christmas have spent most of their time working on the film itself rath--er than its Christmas special.It feels as if someone had merely made a list of tllings associated with the holiday.
However,Sid,the series'most likable character,is a high point of the film.In the film,he's still got his silliness,enthusiasm and useful amusing shape.Whatever else is happening,the filmmakers make Sid reliably funny.",high21500.txt
