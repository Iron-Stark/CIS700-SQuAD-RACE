Canberra, the nicest city in Australia
I went for a short holiday to Canberra. My uncle lives there. It's the nicest city in Australia, a little bit similar to Cairns. There're lots of big rivers and trees around the city.

The small city of Mount Isa
I went to Mount Isa six months ago. It's a long way from Brisbane -- about 2,000 km. It's a small city, with a population of 21,000, but it has all the basic _ such as a base hospital, six schools and supermarkets. Here the weather is hot and gets very little rain. There're two big lakes to keep rainwater for people in the city to drink.

Lake Moondarra and amine  
In Mount Isa, there's adam   called Lake Moondarra. At weekends you can go there with your friends, and it is beautiful. On the lake, there is water skiing. Also, people can go fishing there.
There's a big mine in Mount Isa. Many people go to work in the mine and earn a lot of money. Mount Isa isn't a beautiful green place, but many people love it.
