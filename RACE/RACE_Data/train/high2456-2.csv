2,C,"['Lucky.', 'Hardworking.', 'Positive.', 'Humorous.']",Which of the following words can best describe the author?,"My name is Amanda LaMunyon. I have Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism  . I don't see myself as a person with a disability. I share who I am when I paint, sing and write.
I started writing poetry because I wanted to tell people what it was like to have Asperger's syndrome. I don't know how my life would be different without Asperger's, but I know I look at the world differently than most people. I'm also learning that you don't have to be like everybody else. You just have to be confident in who you are.
I discovered I could paint when I was 7. My math teacher Mrs. Brock loved one of my paintings so much that she hung it on the wall in her bedroom. I was so encouraged by her and since then my life has changed greatly.
Soon after, people asked me to show my art for charity events. I began to donate prints of my work for charity auctions  . I was glad that I really made a difference. I learned that when you give, you receive happiness.
I think it is very important for teens to express themselves. It's a way to know yourself more clearly. You can turn your thoughts and feelings into a piece of artwork or a poem.
For example, when you paint, colors can help you express different emotions. When you write a poem, you have to get really honest with yourself and not be afraid to write down what you feel.
Creativity makes you unique and sets you apart from others. Creative ideas also help you make your dreams come true. They help you look at things in a new way.
I hope my story helps people to believe they can overcome their challenges and achieve their dreams. I like to encourage others. I know what encouragement has meant to me.",high2456.txt
