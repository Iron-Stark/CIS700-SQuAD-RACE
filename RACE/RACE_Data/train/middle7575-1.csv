But one day the bird flew away. He became sad and went out to look for it. At last, he met the bird on a mountain. [:Zxxk.Com]
He asked excitedly, ""Will you please go home with me, my bird?"" Though the bird was also happy to see the old man, it shook its head.
""Take me to your home and let me see how you live,"" the old man said. The bird led the old man to its new home. And he found it lived well with many other birds. So he decided to go back. Before he was leaving, the bird gave him a basket.
When he returned home, he told his wife what had happened. She opened the basket and saw a lot of gold. The old woman was very greedy and she wanted to get more baskets. So she set out for the sparrow's home.
""Hello, sparrow. I miss you very much,"" cried the woman falsely  . The bird said nothing. It gave her two baskets, a light one and a heavy one. The bird asked her to choose one and she could only open it after she reached home.
Of course, she chose the heavy one and took it home with great difficult. However, when she opened the basket, she found it was full of stones!",middle7575.txt
