Their lifestyles, friends, and social habits can have a strong influence on our lives. It is a good idea to get to know the people next door or across the street to develop a community   of support and safety. You never know when a neighbour will find a stranger walking around your house, or you may want to leave an extra key at their house in case someone in your family gets locked out.
How do you get along with your neighbours? Here are some tips for building a better relationship with your neighbours.
Point 1...Proper greetings can make your neighbours remember your name and pave   the way for more meaningful future meetings. Don't stay too long, though, or you'll wear out your welcome!
Point2...If your neighbour is building a pool, offer a few hours of help. Besides, you never know when the favor might be returned.
Point3...If you hear that someone who live close to you has had an accident, take over a hot meal or some fruit. Your action will add a special touch during a difficult time.
Point4...Invite your neighbours over for a cup of coffee in December or an Easter egg hunt in spring. A backyard barbecue   can be a great way to share food and fun.
Your neighbours may annoy you at times, but they are like family in many ways. Appreciate their strengths and overlook their weaknesses, and everyone will get along just fine.",high1466.txt
