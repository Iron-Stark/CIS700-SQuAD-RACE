2,A,"['go for her dream of traveling to India', 'experience Indian culture at home', 'save money for retirement', ""refuse her parents' gift money""]",Amy suggested Joan   _  .,"Dear Amy,
My husband is a loving, creative and sensitive person who is 15 years my senior. (I am in my mid-30s.)
Now I still struggle with my ups and downs, and he is still broke. I have continually asked my husband to get a job. I know he's trying, but even a part-time job at a convenience store would make ends meet. His former profession as a freelance  producer dropped off with the economy, and while he tries hard to find work in his field, he is extremely unwilling to accept the fact that he may need to get a ""regular""job.
I love him very much, but I can't continue to keep my frustration bottled up. I tell myself I'm going to leave him if he doesn't find work, but I really want to stay together. How should I handle this?
Round the Bend
Dear Round,
Having been a freelancer for many years, I assure you (and him) that the true meaning of freelancing is that you have the freedom to accept a variety of jobs, as well as the responsibility to make a living between jobs. Freelancers teach, tend bar, sell things door to door and do anything it takes to bring home the money. Volunteering is also a wonderful way to keep busy and meet new people.

Dear Amy,
""Joan"" was a 50-year-old reader who wants to spend her parents' gift (money) on a trip to India. Her retirement fund  is less than half of what she will need for retirement. It's also clear that she hasn't budgeted monthly for car repairs and other out-of-pocket expenses. In your answer, you encourage her to go.
She's 50 and the clock is ticking! How will she feel about the trip she took when she turns 70 when she can't afford to retire? Maybe there are other ways she can experience Indian food, culture, history and art without spending the entire sum of money. When her ""health slows her down."" she may wish she had kept a rainy-day fund.

Dear Realistic,
Your argument is very logical and realistic, but there are also times when you have to go for it. I hope she does.
