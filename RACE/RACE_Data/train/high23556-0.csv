0,A,"['A man was beaten due to his protecting an abused dog', ""A dog's owner was put in prison due to his beating the dog"", 'Stop beating the dog', 'Dogs are friends of humans']",What's the best title for the passage?,"When Jamie Beondik saw a puppy getting beaten with a chain, he tried to help. What he got in return was a beating of his own and he had to go to hospital.
The neighbors saw the fourmonthold black dog named Tomba Wednesday morning being beaten, choked and dragged on a chain by a man on a bike.
Jamie decided to get involved, telling the man to stop hurting Tomba.
""He started swinging the chain around in the air and I said 'OK. Well, I'm going to call the police.' And that's when he hit me with the chain,"" said Jamie.
He got hit in the legs and then the man and the dog ran off.
Twenty minutes later, the man came back and attacked Jamie with a slingshot   before throwing a rock at him, hitting him in the back.
Jamie now has to use the wall to steady himself and his hands won't stop shaking, but he expects to be OK.
Despite his injuries, he has no regrets. Jamie says he'd do it all again.
""He was hurting the dog. I have had a dog for 13 years that looked just like Tomba. The dog was crying for help. I just wanted him to let the dog go. I didn't think he'd beat me,"" said Jamie.
The police arrested the man, who would face at least one charge of assault  .
Tomba obviously was not seriously injured.
""That's all that's important. The dog's okay and he's in prison,"" said Jamie.",high23556.txt
