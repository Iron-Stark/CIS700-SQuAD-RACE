As it was drinking , it was carried away by the running water. A kind bird saw the bee's danger. It picked a leaf and threw it into the water in front of the bee. The bee was able to climb onto the leaf, and it was brought safely to the land. The bee thanked the bird for its kindness and then flew away. Not long after , the bird was sitting on the branch  of a tree . It did not see that a man was aimming his gun at it .But the bee saw what the man was doing . So the bee flew into the man's eye, and hurt him. The pain in his eye was so great that he was not able to shoot the bird, and the bird flew away.
