0,B,"['Humor is the key to success in our work and our lives.', 'Humor enables us to cope with difficult situation effectively.', 'Humor is the only best way to criticize someone without losing his face.', 'Humor makes fun of any difficult situations.']",What is the main idea of the passage?,"Humor is a most effective, yet frequently neglected, means of handling the difficult situations in our lives.

He successfully elbowed the swinging dining-room door, but the backswing threw the bird onto the dining-room floor.
The boy stood rooted: guests stared at their plates. Moving only her head the hostess smiled at her son,"" No harm, Daniel,"" she said. ""Just pick him up and take him back to the kitchen""... she enunciated clearly so he would think about what she was saying... ""and bring in the other one.""
