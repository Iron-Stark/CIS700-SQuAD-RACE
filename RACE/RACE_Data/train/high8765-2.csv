This might surprise you.When teachers are presenting new information,they often give students lots of help.But a new study shows this may not be the best way to support learning.""Don't be too quick to get help when learning something new,""education expert Manu Kapur said.""Try to work on it yourself even if it means trying different ways.''
Kapur came up with the idea that trying hard can lead to better learning.Then he tested it out on students in Singapore.He separated students into two groups.In the first group,students were asked to solve math problems with the teacher's help.In the second group,students were asked to solve the same problems by helping one another,instead of getting help from the teacher.
With the teacher's help,students in the first group were able to find the correct answers.Students in the second group did not solve the problems correctly.But they did come up with a lot of good ideas.
The students were then tested on what they had 1earned.The group without any help from a teacher scored much higher than the group who had help.Kapur said working to find the answers helped students understand the process ,not just the solution.
Kapur's advice for kids is to put a 1ot of effort into learning something new rather than going to your teacher for help.""Simply doing a little work or nothing at all won't work.""says Kapur.""Try to solve a problem in as many ways as possible.''",high8765.txt
