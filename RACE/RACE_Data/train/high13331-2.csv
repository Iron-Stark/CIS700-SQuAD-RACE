2,D,"['Samake only has daughters.', 'Samake is well-educated.', 'Ramatou is a doctor.', 'Mariam is in the sixth grade.']",What do we know about Samake and her family?,"""To educate a girl is to educate a thousand people,"" says Maimouna Samake, a mother of six children(including five girls). ""If you put one seed  in the ground and rain comes, it will grow to produce many seeds.""
Samake, one of 2,000 residents, lives in a small village, Sounkala, in one of the world's poorest countries. Now she has a chance to see this wish come true thanks to build On, an American non-profit organization that is building a school in her community.
For 17 years, build On has been sending American high school students overseas to create schools in places where literacy and formal education are usually out of reach. The organization has built about 300 schools in Mali, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal, Nicaragua and Haiti. Its goal is to get young Americans in mostly urban  areas to get involved in education. At the same time it can bring literacy to children and adults in poor villages in the developing world.
Sounkala's school only has about 70 children; mud floors, poor lighting, few desks and an absence of books mean that the school is not the most ideal learning environment. Therefore they certainly could use build On's help.
Samake hasn't been to school, but she wants a better future for her five daughters, including Ramatou, 12, and Mariam, 10. ""When a woman attends school, she will teach what she learns to her children,"" said Ramatou, who wants to become a doctor. ""She will also know how to take better care of her family.""
Build On tries to build schools for grades one to three. If things go well over those three years, they return to help build another school for grades four to six, and then set up evening adult literacy classes.
Ramatou and Mariam will not learn inside the walls of build On school since they are already in the sixth grade, but Samake hopes that they will be able to attend evening classes to continue learning.",high13331.txt
