1,D,"['He left her wife.', 'He learned to sing and dance', 'He left his home and went into the world.', 'He would call her and showed his love to her.']",What did the man do after the little girl left her home?,"A great man married a woman and they had a little lovely girl.
When the little girl was growing up, the man usually hugged her and said, ""I love you, little girl."" The Little girl would say, ""I'm not a little girl any more."" Then the man would laugh, ""But to me, you'll always be my little girl.""
The little girl later left her home and went into the world. No matter where she was, the man would call her and say, ""I love you, little girl.""
One day the little girl received an unexpected phone call. The great man became ill. He couldn't talk, smile, walk, hug or dance.
So she went to the side of the great man. He looked at her and tried to speak, but he could not. She sat next to the great man, and drew her arms around his useless shoulders . Her head on his chest , she thought of many good memories. She felt sad as she couldn't hear the words of love that had comforted her.
And then she heard from within the man, the beat of heart. The magic happened. She heard what she wanted to hear. His heart beat out the words that his mouth could no longer say... I love you, little girl... I love you, little girl.",high4474.txt
