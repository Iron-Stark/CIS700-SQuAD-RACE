3,C,"['to be polite to adults', 'to be in better health', 'to have good manners', 'to do well in exams']","According to the article, the writer would like the kids   _  .","When you cough  or sneeze, please turn your head away from others and cover your mouth with the full part of your hand. Afterwards, you should say,"" Excuse me."" This is a rule I set for my students.
It is so simple, but many kids have never been told to do _ . In fact, I notice adults cough and sneeze in public without putting a hand over the mouth. I hate traveling by underground in New York during cold and flu  season, because it is certain that someone is going to stand right behind me and cough or sneeze on my neck.
One important thing I point out to the kids is that after they sneeze or cough on their hand, they should wash their hands as soon as possible. Otherwise, they will be passing those _ along to everything and everyone they touch.
In order to help the students remember this rule, I tell them about an old story. It says that when you sneeze, evil spirits jump into your body. If you don't cover your mouth, the spirits will enter, but if you cover your mouth, you will keep them out, We say ""God bless you"" when someone sneezes, and in Germany  you should say ""Gesundheit"". That means ""Good health to you."" Both expressions are said that if you didn't cover your mouth in time and the spirits were able to enter your body. The kids love finding out the origins  of these expressions and it encourage them to put the advice to use more often.",middle1891.txt
