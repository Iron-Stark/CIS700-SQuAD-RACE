2,B,"['The author had known Rich Ezzo before', ""The author hasn't dreamed of getting rich instantly"", 'The author always prefers e-books to paper books', 'The author likes the get-rich type of publication']",Which of the following is true according to the passage?,"A week ago, I read When Money Talks, Listen! by Rich Ezzo.

I absolutely love this e-book. Why did I wait a week to write the review ? simple. I wanted to see if the impact it had on me could keep up.

I had so many thoughts running around my mind that I had to install a stop light to stop some while others made their way into the picture. I had a mental traffic jam, which only goes to show how slow the traffic usually is.
It has been a week and the impact is the same. I guarantee this is an e-book you'll want to read. I urge you to visit the author's website, MysterMoney. Com, and to download the e-book. You won't
