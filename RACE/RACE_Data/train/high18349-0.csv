         All sharks are the same. 
         This is  ly not true. There are nearly four hundred species of sharks and they vary widely in habitat, size, features, diet and lifestyle. They range from the cigar shark, which is about 15 centimetres long, to the whale shark, which can be up to about nine meters long. More than 50 percent of sharks are less than a metre long and more than 90 percent are less than two metres long. And their habitat ranges from shallow to deep water and from the Arctic to the Tropic.

         This is not true, either. In fact, many shark populations are decreasing. The chief reason for this is that hundreds of thousands of them are caught in fishing nets. Depending on where they are caught. They are either killed for their fins , which are used in shark's fin soup, or they are tossed back into the sea because they are unwanted. Almost all sharks which are discarded in this way die. Also, sharks mature late in life and produce very few young. If the current reduction in numbers continues, the ecological balance of the oceans will be severely threatened. 
         Sharks will always attack you 
         This is nonsense. The chances of being attacked by a shark are minimal. You are 250 times more likely to be killed by lightning than by a shark, and your chances of being killed by lightning are practically zero.
         However, if you are planning to take a swim in shark territory, then follow these simple rules:
         Avoid swimming at dawn or duck when visibility decreases.
         Avoid areas where there are breaking waves. Turbulent  water makes it difficult for sharks to see and determine whether you are prey . 
         Do not wear jewellery in the water. Sharks are attracted to shiny fishes, and jewellery may resemble their scales . 
         Do not swim near schools of small fish, which are the favorite food of some sharks.",high18349.txt
