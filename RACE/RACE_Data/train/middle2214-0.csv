One afternoon on his way to a basketball game, he was walking and dreaming about playing college basketball the following year. As Ron was walking to the game, a car hit him so hard that he was thrown three feet into the air.
Ron woke up in a hospital room. When he learned that both his legs were broken, he realized his college basketball dreams were over. Ron did what the doctors told him, but his progress was slow. When he left the hospital, Ron was sent to a health center for physical treatment.
A week after he arrived there, he met Sunny. Sunny was a coach.His legs were hurt  paralysed  from a skiing accident. Even though he couldn't move his legs, Sunny coached of a basketball team called the Suns. Everybody on the team played from a wheelchair. Sunny invited Tony to join the game. Tony played badly, but for the first time since the accident, he stopped feeling sorry for himself.
After becoming a part of the Suns, Ron improved quickly. Basketball was like   medicine for him. And whenever Ron became depressed or angry, Sunny was there to encourage and help him. The day before Ron left the center, he had dinner with Sunny. He asked Sunny how he managed to be generous and cheerful, even with his paralysis.
Sunny smiled and said, ""It's really quite easy. When you keep your face to the sun, the shadows  fall behind.""",middle2214.txt
