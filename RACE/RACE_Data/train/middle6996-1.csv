1,B,"['they know every product well', 'they are famous', 'they are all experts', 'they all like white coats']",Some stars appear in the ads because   _  .,"Open today's newspaper. What do you see?  Ads!  Turn on the TV. Still more ads!  Everywhere you look, someone has something to sell.
Here are some ways ads get us to buy.
Some ads use famous people. Stars are paid to sell a product. Think about it. Do they really know about medicine?  Do they know about soft drinks?  These people may be famous. But they may not know about what they are selling.
Some ads make you think you're getting the words of experts . A man in a white coat comes on TV. He looks nice. ""I use White and Black, "" he says. This man looks like a doctor. But he is an actor. He has been paid to sell this product.
Does soap  have anything to do with a pretty child?  Not much. But ads may show their products with something nice, such as the sun, the flowers and so on. Such an ad is about feelings rather than fact.
Ads are full of strong words like ""new"" and ""power"" . They can help a product sell. The soap may be called ""Spring Rain"". A car may be called ""Tiger"". Strong words work on our feelings.
Some ads make promises . But can they keep them?  No. Some ads use our fear of being too late. ""Buy now! "" they say, ""Selling ends soon. "" Check to see if this is true. Don't hurry. Take time to think.
All ads hope we will buy something, do something, or think in a certain way. Know what ads are doing. Ask questions to yourself. Don't let their words and pictures fool you.
