1,B,"[""The writer's parents didn't want him to be a sports announcer."", ""There were no radio announcer jobs in the writer's hometown."", 'The writer became uninterested in being a sports announcer.', 'The writer got a job as a sports announcer in Dixon at last.']",Which of the following is TRUE?,"""Everything happens for the best."" Whenever I faced disappointment, my mother would say this to me.
After I graduated form college in 1932, I decided to find a job in radio as a sports announcer . I went to Chicago and knocked at the door of every station. But unluckily, I was refused every time.
At one station, a kind lady told me that big stations wouldn't hire  a person without any experience and suggested that I try my luck at smaller stations. Following her advice, I went back to Dixon, where I had grown up. There were no such jobs in Dixon, and my father said a newly-opened store wanted a local athlete to work for it. I wanted this job, but I was refused again.
""Everything happens for the best,"" Mom reminded me. Dad offered me the car to look for a job. I tried WOC Radio in Davenport, Iowa. The program director, Peter MacArthur, told me they had already hired an announcer.
As I left his office, I felt so frustrated. ""How can I become a sports announcer if I can't get a job in a radio station?"" I asked aloud.
While I was waiting for the elevator, I heard someone calling. It was MacArthur. ""What was that you said about sports? Do you know anything about football?"" Then he asked me to have a try. He was pleased with my performance, and he offered me a chance to work there.
On my way home, I thought of my mother's words: ""If you carry on, one day something good will happen. Something wouldn't have happened if without the failure before.""",middle1062.txt
