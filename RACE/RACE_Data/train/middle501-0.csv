0,C,"['the importance of reading', 'to read in the morning', 'about the ways of studying', 'to have patience in studying']",The article tell us   _,"The aim of students who come to school is to study.But study requires a right way, or you waste either the time or the money. The following are the ways for studying.
The best time for reading is morning, because in the morning, the air is fresh and the mind is clear. For that reason, we can get good results.
In studying we must have patience. If we have not known a text well, we must read it again. We should not read the next one till we have learned the first one.
When we are studying, we must put our hearts into the book, or we can get nothing from the book while we are reading.
We must always ask "" why"" . If it is not well understood, write it down and ask our teachers or our parents, brothers or friends. In any possible way, we must know it completely and what we've learned can be used well and made better.
Though there are many ways for studying, the above mentioned will be quite enough if we can keep them in heart and do so.",middle501.txt
