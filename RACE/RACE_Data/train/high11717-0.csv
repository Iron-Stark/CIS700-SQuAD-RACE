Whose opinion should we trust? A survey found that 60% of UK adults think it is worth paying for a ""good newspaper"", and most of those said they believed more of what they read in the paid-for newspapers.
Here was something newspapers understood--here was what they could offer: news plus comment and opinion.
And the Internet now offered opportunities.A newspaper was just that: news printed on paper.But the Internet now offered newspapers different places to print, and in different media.
This may explain why the readership of newspapers online in the UK is very different from people who read printed newspapers.
The most popular newspaper in the UK is The Sun and is also the most popular newspaper in the world.The ""mid--market"" audience mainly reads The Daily Mail.Of the ""quality"" newspapers, the most popular is the Daily Telegraph.
Online, it's a different story.The most popular site is The Mail, which has 2.3 million ""browsers"" every day.And the next most popular site is The Guardian.",high11717.txt
