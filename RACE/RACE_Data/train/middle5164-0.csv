0,D,"['ugly and terrible', 'funny but terrible', 'ugly and dangerous', 'funny and educational']","When the writer was a kid, he thought that the cartoons then were   _  .","When I was a kid, I never had any problems watching some cartoons. It was so much fun and a great education  too. Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Tom and Jerry were my idols . Even now I really feel that they are worth watching at any age.
The problem I've found is the cartoons at present. Some of them contain something ugly. Most of the time, they show such many terrible characters with violence that you wonder what they really mean. Cartoons are supposed to be funny but they aren't. If you are expecting to teach your kids good manners and behavior, then they are the worst for your kids to watch.
Kids often imitate what they see in cartoons. If your kid is a fan of such cartoons, he or she will follow his or her favorite cartoon character and try to do something extremely dangerous.
Therefore, try not to let your kids watch too many today's cartoons. Make sure to keep an eye on what they are watching.",middle5164.txt
