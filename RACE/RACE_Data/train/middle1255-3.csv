When she was about 19 months old, she got very ill. After many weeks, the doctor told her parents, ""Your daughter is better, but now she can't see and she can't hear."" Her mother and her father were very sad. After a few years , things got worse. There was no way for Helen to speak to other people. She heard nothing. She didn't understand anything.
