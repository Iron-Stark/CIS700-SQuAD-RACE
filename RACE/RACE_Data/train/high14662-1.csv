Operation Always ride your bike in a safe, controlled manner on campus . Obey rules and regulations. Watch out for walkers and other bicyclists, and always use your lights in dark conditions.
Theft Prevention Always securely lock your bicycle to a bicycle rack -- even if you are only away for a minute. Register your bike with the University Department of Public Safety. It's fast, easy, and free. Registration permanently records your serial number, which is useful in the possible recovery of the bike stolen.
Equipment
Brakes Make sure that they are in good working order and     adjusted properly.
Helmet A necessity, make sure your helmet meets current safety standards and fits properly.
Lights Always have a front headlight -- visible at least 500 feet in front of the bike. A taillight is a good idea.

If you are involved in an accident, you are required to offer appropriate aid, call the Department of Public Safety and remain at the scene until the officer lets you go.
