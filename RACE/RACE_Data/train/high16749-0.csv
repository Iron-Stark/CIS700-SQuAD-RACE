It may even cause death.', 'Students should not learn from the skeleton to smoke.']",What do the professor's words mean ?,"George and Carol were medical students at the same college and, like many other college students, they enjoyed playing jokes on people. Both of them smoked, but they knew that their professor was strongly against it, because smoking was dangerous to one's health. One day they decided to play a joke on their professor. 
At one of their medical lectures there was always a skeleton in the room so that the professor could show the students the different bones in the human body. 
That afternoon, Carol and George put a cigarette in the mouth of the skeleton that was to be used for their next lecture.
