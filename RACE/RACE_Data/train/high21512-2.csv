2,C,"['Plan your move well in advance.', 'Make sure everything is clean.', 'Pay your friends enough money.', 'Buy lots of magazines on moving.']","According to the passage, which of the following is necessary before the moving?","Moving should be an exciting time -- you're off to a new home, maybe moving up to a larger home. But for many people, moving turns into a stressful experience. It doesn't have to be that way. Some planning and a little research can make your next move the best one ever.
       Organization is the key to a successful move, so list your friends. Write down all the details  that you need, especially things that might be lost during the move.
       Once you decide to move, start packing  things immediately. You can find all the supplies you need, such as boxes, packing tape and more at truck rental outlets   like Budget Truck Rental. The experts there can help you figure out how many and what types of boxes you'll need.
       About a month before your moving date, reserve   your moving truck. The company you choose makes a big difference. Budget Truck Rental has 30,000 trucks nationwide for you to choose.
       Take care of your mail. Stop by your local post office and write the new address where your mail should be sent. You'll also want to change the address on any magazine subscriptions   or other services you receive by mail.
       Make sure you have a group of friends to help you move. If you still have some boxes to pack, your friends can help you put the boxes into the truck while you finish up.",high21512.txt
