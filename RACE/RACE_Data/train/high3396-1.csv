1,C,"['He helped pull out cars.', 'He made money.', 'He filled water to the hole', 'He slept at home.']",What did the farmer usually do at night?,"Very far away from the city lived a poor farmer and his wife. In front of their house was a small dirt road. Very few cars drove on this road because it was so far from the city. On the dirt road, there was a big hole filled with water. The hole was very deep, but drivers on the road didn't know just how deep. Drivers always drove into the hole, but they never drove out.
One day, a man in a new car was driving down the road. He saw the hole with the water, but he didn't think it was very deep. He drove into the hole, but he couldn't drive out. The man saw the farmer on his tractor working in the field, and he signaled to the farmer. The farmer drove over to the man in the new car.
""Is there a problem?""asked the farmer.
""Yes,""said the man.""My car is stuck in this hole. Can you help me?""
""Maybe,""said the farmer.""But I'm very busy.""
""lf you help me, I'll pay you,"" said the man.
""OK,""said the farmer. The farmer pulled the car out of the hole with his tractor, and the man paid him a lot of money. The man looked at the farmer and said,""You must. make a lot of money pulling cars out of this hole day and night.""
""Actually, no,""said the farmer.
""Why not?""asked the man.
""The hole is very deep, and a lot of people get stuck and ask for help. But I don't make money day and night because I don't pull cars out at night.""
""At night I'm busy filling the hole with water,"" answered the farmer.",high3396.txt
