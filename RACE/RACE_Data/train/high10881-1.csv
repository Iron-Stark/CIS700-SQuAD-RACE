1,C,"['Turn to their friends for help.', 'Visit their families and relatives.', 'Contact someone in need of help.', 'Share their problems on their page:']",What did the author challenge her friends to do?,"The other day, I noticed a message on a friend's page. It made me very sad. She says she is the one
who reaches out to people, but rarely do they reach out to her. So, after communicating with her for a while, I began to challenge my friends. ""Contact someone right now. Send messages or call someone who you haven't spoken to for a while, or who you only talk to when they message or call you. Let someone who may feel alone in the world right this moment know that they are not alone. That is my challenge to you. Please do it , and let me know once you have. Either by calling me back, or by sending me a message. Be the change that you want to see in the world. ""
The response was great. 28people liked my post, another 10 posted that they did, and I got about a dozen messages telling me that they did. And there was one very special message:
""I just want you to know what has happened. That day, I sent a message to a friend who I hadn't heard from for a while. She and I talked for a whole day back and forth on messages and then on the phone. She said she was so incredibly sad. Nobody has spoken with her in two weeks. By the tone of her voice, and by the conversations we were having, I think she was about to take her own life . After our conversation, she has agreed to talk to someone. Your message of kindness has saved her. I can't wait to tell you how thankful I am for people like you in the world, who care when nobody else will. I am proud to call myself your friend. Thank you! ""
I didn't quite know what to say after reading the message. I was wondering how best to use it for greater good. I decided that sharing what we have done is the most powerful way. I know that I am a cheerleader when it comes to making the world a better place with kindness, because if I help someone, it makes me feel better. I do it because I need to feel better.",high10881.txt
