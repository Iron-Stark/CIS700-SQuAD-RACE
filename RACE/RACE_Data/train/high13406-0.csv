0,B,"['To have an exhibition.', 'To seek artistic freedom.', 'To visit his friends.', 'To earn money.']",Why did Chen Xiao leave China for Australia in 1986?,"The world, in painter Chen Xiao's eyes, is as colorful and sweet as ice cream.
At the opening of his latest exhibition, Colorful World in the Eyes of Sean Chen, at the National Museum of China recently, the artist told his story.
Chen left China for Australia in 1986 to seek artistic freedom, and like many new immigrants then, he had little money in his pocket. To make ends meet, he drew portraits of people in the street.
Every day, he saw people buy ice cream from a shop. Chen couldn't help wondering: ""It must taste great, that's why so many people buy it."" But he didn't buy one for himself because he had to save money to support his studies. After four months of painting there and watching people eat ice cream, Chen didn't resist the temptation --- he bought an ice cream. ""The first bite took me to heaven,"" Chen recalls while laughing. ""You know, as a poor young man in a new country, an ice cream was too expensive then."" Since then, he kept the taste of the ice cream in his heart and included the happy feelings in his paintings, which turn out to be colorful and sweet.
His current exhibition is part of his nationwide tour that began at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing in 2011. He plans to take his artworks to 24 cities around China by 2016. The exhibition at the National Art Museum of China will last until April 22. After the exhibition tour, he will sell his works through an auction , and all the money will be donated to protection of the environment in China. ""The natural environment of New Zealand has inspired my artwork and brought me enjoyment. I hope people in my home country can enjoy the same beautiful environment as I do,"" says Chen, who has made New Zealand his home for the last 26 years.",high13406.txt
