0,C,"['People.', 'Birds.', 'A little plant.', 'Branches.']",Who was the big tree's neighbor?,"A big, mighty  tree stood in a forest. Its branches  spread out and its roots   went deep in the earth. A lot of people came here to have a rest under it. And a lot of birds stood on its branches to sing and dance. The big tree was very proud all the time.
At the foot of the tree, there was a little plant. The plant was thin, and seemed to be blown down by any of a little wind.
One day, the two neighbors were having a little chat.
""Well, little one,"" said the tree to the plant, ""why not put your feet deeply in the earth, and raise your head high in the air as I do?""
""I see there is no need to do so,"" said the plant with a smile. ""In fact, I think I may be safer in this way.""
""Safer?"" said the tree. ""Are you safer than I am? Do you know how deep my roots are in the earth and how strong my branches are? Who can possibly pull me out by the roots or bow my head to the ground?"" And the tree didn't want to say anything to the weak plant.
But the tree was to regret its words very soon. One evening, a great hurricane  came. It blew the trees off their roots and almost destroyed the forest completely. It uprooted(......)the mighty tree and blew it away with great force.
When the storm had gone, the villagers living nearby came to check the damage. The mighty tree lay on the ground, but the little plant still stood there.",middle8269.txt
