0,A,"['To see if his sharksuit works.', 'To study what sharks feed on.', 'To catch a special kind of white shark.', 'To learn how to swim with sharks safely,']",Why did Sullivan get close to sharks?,"Whenever you buy something, it is possible that someone has already worn, eaten, or tested
it to make sure it is safe and do what is supposed to do. But what if you wanted a special suit to keep a shark from hurting you? Who wants to test a product like it?
""I do! "" says Jeremiah Sullwan, a scientist in   California  ""You have to believe in what you sell, right?""
Sullivan. owns SharkArmor Tech, a company that makes a  $ 49400 sharksuit that even a great white shark can' t bite through. Before Sullivan could sell his sharksuits, he needed to make sure his design would work. Sullivan put on the sharksuit and jumped into a shark feeding ground. ""I need to know exactly what a human body could expect to go through,"" he says. Sharks moved all around him and then attacked his arm. Sullivan felt the bite but no teeth. He was uncomfortable at times, but not painful. The suit works! ""
""I've now been bitten thousands of times but. never badly,"" says Sullivan, who now works with shows like Wild Kingdom, and programs for the Discovery Channel's Shark Week.
So,are you all set to buy a sharksuit? Before you do, you should know that the suit weighs 20 pounds and makes swimming almost impossible-- _ . And in fact, Sullivan wants only professionals, such as filmmakers, scientists and drivers, to have sharksuits. Why? Because even if someone is wearing a sharksuit, they could get seriously hurt if they treat diving with a 4,OOO-pound shark as a game.
During sharksuit testing, sharks have thrown Sullivan to a bottom o/ reefs  and tried to take him off into the deepest part of the ocean. ""However,"" Sullivan says,"" you don't need to be afraid of sharks. It's actually pretty hard to get a shark to bite you, """,high11255.txt
