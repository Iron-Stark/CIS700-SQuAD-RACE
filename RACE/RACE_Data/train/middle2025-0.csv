Dear Madam or sir ,
One of the teachers at my school in Japan told me that your school has summer courses . I'm planning to go to the USA next summer and would like to take a one- month course .
I'm 18 years old and have been studying English for six years . I'm going to study English at the university . I have ever been to a few countries , such as China , England ,Korea ,but never to the US ,and I think a trip will help me improve my English .
Could you send me a catalogue and application ? I would also like information about New Hampshire and other places nearby .
I hope to do some traveling when the course is over .
Thank you . I look forward to your reply .
Yours ,
