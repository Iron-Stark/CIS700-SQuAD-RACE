3,B,"['full of meat', 'with fruits and vegetables', 'quickly', 'in the evening or after breakfast']","If you snack, you will surely eat something  _  .","My name is Paul Miller. Sometimes I am too fat,  but lately I do not have this problem. My doctor tells me to jog. So early every morning I run for two miles. I do not run fast,  but I do not stop to rest. I jog before breakfast.
People call me a jogger. There are many joggers on my street. We often run together in the park or along the road. Jogging helps to keep us strong and healthy.
Jogging is very popular in the United States. People like to feel well and look nice. When my neighbors and I jog,  we help to keep our hearts and legs strong.
Many people do not jog,  but they do not get fat. They work hard on their jobs and they do not need to run before they go to work.
Diets are also popular. People on diets do not eat many foods that will make them fat. They learn to eat fruits and vegetables instead of candy or cakes.
My doctor tells me to eat only three meals a day. A diet is not necessary if I do not eat between meals. Some people like to eat many times a day. This is called snacking.
I feel healthy and my doctor is happy because I jog every day and I do not snack in the evening or after breakfast.",middle1210.txt
