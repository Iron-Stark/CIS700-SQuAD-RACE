2,A,"[""Being skinny is good for girls' health."", 'Girls sometimes can do better than boys in Maths.', 'Girls earned as much money as boys did in 2014', ""We'd better give up caffeine.""]",Which of the flowing is NOT true?,"* You'll never be good at Maths.
It's generally accepted that boys are good at Maths and girls aren't. The fact is that it isn't true.
When girls reach their teens, most of them lose their interest in Maths. They think they are females. They want to stay away from things that are boys' things, and Maths is still thought of to be a boy's thing. The Maths class is hard, but if you give it a chance, you could be great at Maths, especially because you are a girl.
* Being skinny is good.
Lots of websites tell visitors that losing interest in eating is a beautiful thing. They are lying. Losing interest in eating is a disease, not a healthy thing. It can kill you.
* You are not supposed to make as much money as a guy.
It's said that in 2014 women who work full-time earn about 23 percent less than guys earn. Once you see real women successful in cool jobs, you'll truly get that you're worth just as much or more than any guys.
* Caffeine   will help you study better.
Caffeinated soft drinks have long been advertised as must-haves for women when you have to work very hard. But if you want to do your body a big favor, you'd better give up caffeine.",middle6149.txt
