0,C,"['with her students', 'with her husband', 'in Youth magazine', 'in Xiamen University']",The mother shared her advice   _  .,"When talking about picking a right school, a mother and teacher gave some pieces of advice.
In the latest issue   of Youth magazine, the mother shared the school advice she gave her daughters with young people across the country.
""I've told my daughters many times that I don't want them to choose a name,"" the mother said. ""I don't want them to think, 'Oh, I should go to these top schools.' We live in a country with hundreds of excellent universities. So the first question is: what's going to work for me?""
""When it was time to prepare for picking schools, nobody around me believed I could get into Xiamen University. But through hard work I finally made it,"" she continued. ""So, my second piece of advice is: believe in yourself, no matter what other people might say. Once your goal is set, you only need to try your best to make it come true.""
""The last piece of advice is not to be worried even if your dreams don't come true. As I've said above, there are so many good universities out there. So it's important for everybody to understand that you can always find a university that gives you a great education.""",middle7053.txt
