2,A,"['Robot Receptionist Gets a Job.', 'The Future Receptionist.', 'What Can Robots Do for Us?', 'Robot Staff.']",Which would be the best title for this passage?,"She might not be paid, but Carnegie Mellon University's newest staff member does all that a typical receptionist can do: give directions, answer the phone -- and even gossip about her life.
University officials revealed what it considers to be the world's first robot receptionist with a personality of her own. The blond  receptionist, named ""Valerie,"" puts on a headset and interacts with people by talking about her boss, her psychiatrist  and her dream.
Valerie, the roboceptionist, sits in a custom-made booth at the entrance of a computer science hall. With her ability to distinguish motion, she greets visitors as they come near. Type in a question on a keyboard and she gives directions around the Pittsburgh campus and provides visitors information about the weather. More than that, she tells stories about her life.
From her              booth, passers-by often can hear her talking              on the phone. She recognizes when someone is in front of her and remembers their characteristics. She can change between tasks from talking on the phone to answering a question.
Valerie, however, does have her limit.
She is a drum-shaped mechanical device with a digitally lively face that appears on a computer display. Visitors have to type on a keyboard to communicate with her. And she understands only simple questions.
Eventually her creators would like to install face recognition so people don't have to insert an identity card for her to remember them. And people won't have to type their questions on a keyboard if they can solve the problem of voice recognition in a crowded hall.
Valerie will tell the story of a robot living in a human world.",high18132.txt
