Christopher's Smile was set up in 2008 by Karen & Kevin Capel whose only son Christopher died of cancer at a young age.They hope their charity will help pay for more research into children's cancers.Since then, the charity has raised a lot of money and gotten more and more volunteers.Every year, thousands of people take part in different activities such as charity walk or run to show their support for Christopher's Smile.
The students of Grade 6 at LVS Ascot Junior School also wanted to do something for the sick children.They organized the event ""Pyjamas Day"" to support Christopher's Smile.""We wanted to raise money for our charity in a way that the whole school could join in it, so each pupil paid PS1 to wear his or her pyjamas to school on Pyjamas Day,"" said the young organizers.Both the students and their teachers took part in the event with great interest.Together they not only raised some money, but also had a good time.",middle4015.txt
