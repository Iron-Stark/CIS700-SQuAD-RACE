He sat down at an empty table and waitedfor someone to take his order. Of course nobody did. Finally, a woman with abig plate full of food came up to him. She sat down opposite him and toldhim how a cafeteriaworked.
""Start out at that end,"" she said, ""Just go along the line andchoose what you want. At the other end they'll tell you how much you have topay.""
""I soon learned that's how everything works in America,""the grandfather told my friend later, ""Life's a cafeteria here. You can getanything you want as long as you want to pay the price. You can even get success,but you'll never get it if you wait for someone to bring it to you. You have toget up and get ityourself.""",high10751.txt
