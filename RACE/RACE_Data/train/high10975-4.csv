4,C,"['some good ways to protect rare birds', 'the differences between rare birds and common birds', 'the number of rare birds has increased over the last decade', 'some widespread birds in the UK are in great need of help']",The author's purpose of writing this article is to tell people  _  .,"Rare birds in the UK have been living far better than the more common birds over the last decade due to the efforts of conservation organisations, according to a new assessment.
The research shows almost 60% of the 63 rare birds that live in the UK have increased over the last 10 years.
By contrast, only about one third of common species have increased over the same period. Just 28% of rare birds have decreased over the same period, compared with four out of every 10 common birds. The rare birds described in the assessment with increasing populations include theosprey  andcorncrake . All of these birds are subject to conservation action.
The declining common birds include the nightingale,swift , house sparrow and redgrouse  . These are suffering declines for a variety of reasons, including changes in farming practices.
Dr David Noble, from the British Trust for Ornithology, said: ""That some of our rarer birds have responded to targeted conservation action is great news. It shows just what can be achieved. What we need to do now is to continue the good work and use some of the lessons we have learned to help our more common birds.""
Dr Mark Avery, the conservation director of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), said: ""Over the last decade we've enjoyed some great conservation successes, including removing some threatened species from the World Conservation Union's Red List of Thratened Animals and increasing the populations of red kite, osprey, etc. However, these successes arecountered  by continued declines of some widespread species.""
The overview of 210 native birds has been produced by a group of conservation organisations, to mark the publication ofThe State of the UK's Birdsreport, which is in its l0th year. The report was published by the RSPB for a group of conservation organisations.",high10975.txt
