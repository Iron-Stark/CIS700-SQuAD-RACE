0,D,"['an animal trainer', 'a horse rider', 'a farmer', 'a nurse']",Regina's plan is to be   _   in the future.,"When Regina Mary' parents refused to let her get a horse ,the smart 15-year-olddidn't sit in her room and complain. Instead she turned to a cow called Luna to make her riding dreams come true.
Hours of training ,and tons of treats later, the results are impressive: not only do the two regularly go on long rides through the southern German countryside, they can even do some difficult jumps successfully. Regina joked while sitting on her brown-and-white companion: ""It's unbelievable really , She thinks she's a horse.""
The pairs unlikely friendship started about two years ago, shortly after Luna was born on the Mayer's farm. They
started off with walks in the woods. Then Mayer slowly got her cow more adapted to human contact and riding equipment.
About six months later, it was time to see how Luna would respond to a rider on her back in a competition for horses. Mayer sat in the saddle ,and all went as planned. ""She was really well behaved and walked normally, but after a couple of meters, she wanted to get me off her back! You could see that she got a bit _ "" said Mayer.
Luna and Mayer are now soul mates, spending most afternoons together once the teen--who dreams of becoming a nurse one day--come home from school.",high5267.txt
