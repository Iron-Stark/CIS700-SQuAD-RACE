There are no rules about sleep. Generally speaking, grown-ups sleep about 7 and a half hours each night and probably more than 60 per cent get between seven and eight hours. But perhaps eight per cent are quite happy with 5 hours or less, and four per cent or so find that they want ten hours or more. If you feel all right, you're probably getting enough sleep. The important thing is not to worry how much other people get--their needs may be different. Exercise doesn't seem to increase the need for sleep--office workers, for example, sleep for about as long as people doing physically active work.
Children sleep more than grown-ups--perhaps 14 to 18 hours soon after birth, going down to grown-up levels by early teenage.
