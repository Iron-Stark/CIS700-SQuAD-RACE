 Mostpeopledon'treallyknowwhatpressuresatypicalteenager has to go through.Sure, our parents and grandparents were once teens, but things are so different now.It has never been tougher to a teenager.
 It had never been more important to be in the ""right group"" or to have the ""right brand"" of shoes.And those are the easy things to deal with.We also face problems with family, friends, relationships and school pressures.
 When it gets to be too much, I turn to my friends.One friend I could not live without is Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul.Your books have been so inspiring to me and have helped me to deal with and understand the problems I go through.
 For example, I went through aconfusing time with my friends when we got to junior high.I had known these friends since kindergarten, and when we began junior high it seemed like some of them began to change.We started hanging out with different groups, and we slowly grew so far apart that it seemed as if we had never been friends.I felt confused and hurt.
 Sometime during this period I read the story Friends Forever in Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II.I felt so much better after reading it.It was like aweight had been lifted from me when I realized that many friendships went through changes and that we weren'tthe only friends to experience _ .
 Peoplechange, but that doesn'tmean we have to lose the friendships we once shared.My friends and I still spend time together when we can and care about each other alot.That things are different doesn'tmean I have to forget about all the good times we had.I will always keep the memories in asafe place in my heart.
 Sincerely,
