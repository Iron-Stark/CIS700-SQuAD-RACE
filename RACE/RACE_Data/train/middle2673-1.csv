1,C,"['happy', 'sad', 'lonely', 'lucky']",The writer feels  _   in Shenyang.,"I have worked in Shenyang for two months. I seldom meet Westerners in the street. But on TV, I see many foreigners in Shenyang. I am a little lonely and I really hope to make friends with English speakers. Although I study Chinese hard, my Chinese is poor and I can't communicate in Chinese very well.
However, Chinese people usually smile and wave to me on the bus and at any other places. In the street, the most common conversation goes like this: A Chinese person, ""Hello.""
I, ""Hello.""
The Chinese,""Where are you from?""
""England.""
""Oh, I see!"" and then if his vocabulary is exhausted , ""Bye-bye"". This can happen five or six times on any trip around town. How I hope to see a Westerner at that time.",middle2673.txt
