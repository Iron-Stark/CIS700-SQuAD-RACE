After my appointment was done, Istarted walking down from the building through a long breezeway  and I noticed an elderly woman pacing at the end. I asked if she waswaiting for someone or she needed assistance.
As it turned out, she was havingtrouble walking the distance and had looked for a staff member to pick her up.No one had come for several minutes. I asked her to sit still when I went toget a wheelchair. I ran full speed to the help desk and asked for one. Thereceptionist and I walked to the end of the breezeway to the lady, who said, ""Iwant her to help me.""She was referring to me. I carefully, slowly andattentively helped the woman into the wheelchair. After she was seated, shesoftly looked up to me and thanked me for my help. How could I not have helpedher? I just wanted her to be alright.
When I returned home, I called my bestfriend to ask if she needed me. She wanted me to take her and her boyfriend tothe Boost Mobile Store. I did and after all was taken care of, I took myfriends back home. I thanked them for the opportunity to help them and that Iappreciated it.
