2,B,"['everyone could buy a cheaper TV set', 'Tibetans can do business in and out of Tibet and develop their tourism', 'more and more people could fly to Tibet as soon as possible', 'more and more animals would be killed by people']",After the new railroad was completed   _  .,"Lamu was a 12-year-old Tibetan girl. She wanted to go to Beijing to watch the 2008 Olympics. Only one month ago, Lamu still thought it would be difficult.
In the past Tibet had no railroad  . If Lamu took a bus, it would take her a long time to reach Beijing. And a plane ticket would cost lots of money.
However, things changed for Lamu. She was able to buy a ticket to the world's highest railroad. The Qinghai-Tibet Railway had been completed! The 1,142-kilometer railroad runs on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau  . Lamu could reach Beijing by train in 48 hours!
About 550 kilometers of the railroad are constructed on the frozen earth  . When the frozen earth warms in summer, it can move the track. But Chinese scientists have built a special structure to solve the problem. The Qinghai-Tibet Railway has been designed with the wild animals in the designers' minds. It also has special underpasses   for animals like Tibetan antelopes   to go through.
""The new railroad greatly helps Tibet's tourism,""said Liu Yueqin, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  .
As more tourists take trains to Tibet, there are more money for Tibetans. With the money, more kids can go to school.
The railroad also makes things less expensive in Tibet. Now one can buy a TV set for about 1,500 yuan. It used to be much higher than that price. When there was no railroad, it had been difficult to send things in and out of Tibet. With the new railroad, shopping can be more convenient   and faster.",middle5932.txt
