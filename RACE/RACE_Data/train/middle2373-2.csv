2,D,"['The Lucky King', 'The Great Friend', 'Nothing Stops Real Friendship', 'Everything Happens for the Good']",The best title for the reading is   _  .,"A king in Africa had a close friend that helped him grow up. The friend had a habit of looking at everything positively that happened in his life and saying ""This is good"".
One day the king and his friend were out hunting. The friend would prepare the guns for the king. The friend did something wrong in preparing one of the guns, and after the gun from his friend, the king fired it and his thumb  was blown off. On seeing the situation the friend said as usual, ""This is good!"" The king replied, ""No, this is not good!"" He was very angry and sent his friend to jail .
About a year later, the king was hunting in a forest. Cannibals  caught him and took him to their village. As they were going to kill him, they noticed that the king was missing a thumb. They never ate anyone who was less than whole, so they sent the king back.
When he returned home, he felt sorry for his treatment of his friend. He went quickly to the jail to speak with his friend. ""You were right"", he said. ""It was good that thumb was blown off."" And he told the friend all that had just happened. ""And so I am very sorry for sending you to jail for so long. It was bad for me to do this.""
""No,"" his friend replied, ""this is good!"" ""What do you mean? How could it be good that I sent my friend to jail for a year?""
""If I had not been in jail, I would have been with you, and I would have been eaten!""",middle2373.txt
