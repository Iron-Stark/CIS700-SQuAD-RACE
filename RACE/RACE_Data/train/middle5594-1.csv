It looked nice. The two men hadn't seen it before. One of them thought it was sweet and drank some of it. Tears  ran down from his eyes. But he hoped that his friend felt the same as him. He said nothing. When the other man saw that his friend was crying, he asked, ""Why are you crying, my dear friend?"" ""I was thinking of my father. Two years ago, when he drove out on a wet day, another car hit his car and he died. How poor he was!""

""To think that you were not in the same car as your father was.""",middle5594.txt
