0,D,"['to hold a piece of paper between them', 'to stop yourself talking to others', 'to tell others to be silent', 'to feel whether y our lips move or not']",You may hold your fingers over your lips while reading  _,"Perhaps you have been told about some habits  which stop a person reading fast, and have been strongly asked to break those habits which you might have.
Do you still have any of these bad habits7 Check yourself by answering ""yes"" or ""no"" to
these questions:
1. Do you move your lips  when reading silently?
2. Do you point to words with your finger as you read?
3. Do you move your head from side to side as you read?
4. Do you read one word at a time?
If you answer ""yes"" to any of these questions, start at once to break the habit.
If you move your lips, hold your fingers over them, or hold a piece of paper between your lips while you are reading. Then if your lips move, you will know it and can stop them.
If you point to words, hold the two sides of your book, one side with your left hand, the other side with your right hand. Then you will not have a free finger to use in pointing while reading.
If you move your head, place your chin in one hand, and hold your head still(,).
If you read no more than one or two or three words at a time, you need to work very hard in learning to take in more words at each glance  as your eyes travel across the lines of words.",high2271.txt
