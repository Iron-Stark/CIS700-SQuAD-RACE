2,A,"['Mr. Hunt became a skilled worker', 'Mr. Hunt was friendly to him', 'Mr. Hunt was paid much in the factory', 'Mr. Hunt worked for six years there']","_  , so the old man married his daughter to him.","Mr. Hunt came from a poor family. He had three brothers and two sisters. His father worked hard but wasn't paid much. And his mother did all the housework at home. They were both able but they couldn't get enough money for their family.
Mr. Hunt was in school for only three years and he had to stop to help his parents though he was good at his lessons. When he was sixteen, he came to the city and began to work in a small factory. He learned from an old worker and became a skilled worker. The old worker liked him and married his daughter to him. The young man did not have his own house and had to live with his parents-in-law. His mother-in-law always thought he was poor and often chattered. So the young man tried to save everything and hoped to have his own house.
It was one fine Sunday. The old woman wanted to have a picnic on the top of the hill. She told Mr. Hunt to drive her car. But sometimes she told him to turn left and sometimes to turn right. The young man had to listen to her. At a crossing the lights were red but she made him turn left. The policeman stopped them and told the young man to give his license to him.
""If I did wrong, sir,"" said Mr. Hunt, ""It was my mother-in-law's fault . She was driving the car though she sat behind me!""",middle3579.txt
