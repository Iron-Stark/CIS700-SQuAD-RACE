0,A,"['she was afraid of the deep darkness.', ""she didn't want to go to Germany."", ""she didn't believe in his parents."", 'she was very hungry on road.']",The little girl asked so many questions during the first night because,"While Mr. Wan, his wife and their little daughter were in Europe, they decided to drive three days to Germany.
His little daughter had never travelled at night before. She was scared  the first night in the car, with the deep darkness outside.
""Where are we going, Daddy?"" ""To your uncle's house in Germany.""
""Have you been to his house before?"" ""No.""
""Do you know the way?"" "" _ .""
""Do you know how to read the map?"" ""Yes, we will get there safely.""
""Where are we going to eat if we get hungry before arriving?"" ""We can stop at a restaurant if we get very hungry, my honey.""
""Do you know if there are restaurants on the way?"" ""Yes, there are.""
""Do you know where?"" ""No, but we will be able to find some.""
The same dialogue repeated a few times during the first night and second night. But on the third night, the daughter was quiet. He couldn't help wondering why she was not asking the questions anymore.
""Honey, do you know where we are going?"" ""Germany, to uncle's house.""
""Do you know how we are getting there?"" ""No.""
""Then why aren't you asking me any more?"" ""Because Daddy is driving.""
Because Daddy is driving. That answer from his little girl gave Mr. Wan strength for many years after, whenever he had questions and fears about his life journey.",middle5923.txt
