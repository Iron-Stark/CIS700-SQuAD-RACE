2,D,"['they forget their trouble', 'they will behave normally', 'they become more talkative', 'their moods are getting better']","""Deep acting""is helpful to women in that_.","Pretending to be happy can actually make you more miserable--especially if you're a woman, according to a new study. Researchers found that walking around with a forced smile and faking happiness simply led to people feeling gloomier. So, putting a brave face on your woes could actually be counterproductive.
   The research found that women suffered more than men when pretending to be happy. Psychologist, Dr. Brent Scott, who led the study, said employers should take note because forcing workers to smile when workers were dealing with clients could backfire  . He said:""Smiling for the sake of smiling can lead to emotional exhaustion, and that's bad for the organization.""
   Dr. Scott said the research showed customer service workers who""faked smiles""throughout a day worsened their moods and then withdrew from work, so their productivity dropped. He added:""Bosses may think that getting their staff to smile is good for the organization, but that's not necessarily the case.""Dr. Scott, assistant professor of management at Michigan State University, analyzed a group of bus drivers during a two -week period.
   The study is one of the first of its kind to examine emotional displays over a period of time and compare the different effects that they have on men and women. His team examined the effects of""surface acting""--or fake smiling--compared to what was termed""deep acting"", or cultivating positive emotions by recalling pleasant memories.
Dr. Scott said: ""Women were harmed more by'surface acting', meaning their moods worsened even more than men and they withdrew more from work. However , they were helped more by'deep acting',which meant their moods improved more.""
Dr. Scott suggested women tended to suffer more when pretending to be happy because they were expected to be more emotionally expressive than men. Therefore, faking a smile while they are feeling down is more likely to go against their normal behavior and cause more harmful feelings.
Although,""deep acting""seemed to improve moods in the short term, Dr. Scott said it was not a long-term solution to feeling unhappy.
He said:""You're trying to cultivate positive emotions, but at the end of the day you may not feel like yourself any more""",high20615.txt
