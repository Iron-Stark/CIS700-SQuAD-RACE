2,B,"['three aging guards are involved in a battle', ""he doesn't know the unusual nightlife beforehand"", 'a Roman general plays many jokes on a cowboy', 'he is caught by a wandering dinosaur']","On Larry's first night in the film,   _  .","Teachers spend countless years trying to make history come alive for their students. But, prefix = st1 /USDirector Shawn Levy attempts to do this on film in the recently released Night at the Museum. 
The film is adapted from Milan Trenc's book of the same name. It brings to life a world where dinosaurs wander the earth, a former president rides again, warlike early Asians return, and cowboys and Roman soldiers seek to bring back their old goals. 
The familiar comedy star Ben Stiller acts as a luckless dreamer named Larry Daley. He takes a position as night watchman at the New York Museum of Natural History. 
On Larry's first night, he's left alone by the three aging guards he's replacing. They fail to inform him of the museum's rather unusual nightlife. 
Soon Larry finds himself chased down the hallways by the very lively skeleton of a dinosaur, in the middle of a confrontation  with Asian warriors. He is caught in a territorial battle between a cowboy and a Roman general and meets face-to-face with former USpresident Teddy Roosevelt, played by Robin Williams. They are each from an exhibit that has come to life through the magic of a priceless Egyptian tablet. 
While the film fails to develop very much in some areas (for example, Larry's troubled relationship with a son), it does have enough special effects, and jokes to engage the audience. 
Bottom Line: Definitely not Oscar-worthy, but a great way to relax during a holiday.",high16787.txt
