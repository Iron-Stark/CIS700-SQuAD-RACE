4,B,"['to help all police dogs get normal care', 'to give each police dog a bulletproof vest', 'to make everyone donate for the police dogs', 'to set up her protecting police dogs charity']","According to the passage, Stacey's final goal is   _  .","Stacey Hillman, who is 10 years old, was reading a magazine about police dogs needing bulletproof vests  . She thought that someone should start raising money for the police dogs.
After she got permission from Chief LaBrusciano, she went to the County Sheriff Don Eslinger. She got busy visiting all the police dogs and telling the departments about her new charity. She made ""collection boxes"" by using bottles and put a picture of her with a police dog on it. She put these bottles in vet's offices and pet stores.
The Chief from her hometown police department helped make Stacey's idea an official charity -- Pennies to Protect Police Dogs. The more money she collected, the more popular she became, and the more people offered to donate and help her with her goal   of giving every police dog effective protection. 
Stacey travels all around her state to raise money and tell people how important the police dogs are. She speaks at schools, and they donate to her charity, too. Since Stacey started her charity, she has bought bulletproof vests for the police dogs with all the 140 thousand dollars she has raised. But she has many more K-9 friends that still need to be protected and she promises to keep doing her charity until every police dog in the whole country has a bulletproof vest.
Each vest costs $700, and every police dog should have one. There are not always tax dollars to provide K-9s with these vests, and very few departments have them. The police dogs save lives just like police officers do, and often the police dogs are the first to go in. Stacey depends on donations from everyone to provide the dogs with bulletproof vests.",high16794.txt
