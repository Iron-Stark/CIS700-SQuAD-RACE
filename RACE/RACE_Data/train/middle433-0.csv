0,B,"['Dave', 'Bill', 'Jack', 'Frank']",Who is the eldest brother?,"Bill, Frank and Dave were three brothers. Every year they sent their mother expensive gifts on her birthday,. They liked to show her how rich they were.
The eldest brother. Bill, had a lot of money and he wanted his mother to have the most expensive gifts, but he didn't know what to buy. So he put an ad in the newspaper. ""Wanted-the greatest gift for my mother.""
About a week before his mother's birthday a man came to his office. He brought a big bird.
""This bird."" the man said, ""can speak ten languages and sing some pop songs.""
""Really?  I'd like to listen to it,"" Bill said.
The man made the bird talk in French and tell a joke in Japanese. Then the bird sang a beautiful song. Bill was very happy and paid nine thousand dollars for the bird. The next day Bill sent the bird to his mother with a birthday card.
The day after his mother's birthday he called his mother. ""Well, mother"" he asked, ""What do you think of the bird?""
""Oh, it's very delicious, dear."" said his mother.",middle433.txt
