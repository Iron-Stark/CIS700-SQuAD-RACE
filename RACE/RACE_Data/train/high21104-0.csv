0,D,"['Because the cost pf planting and decorating the tree is too high.', 'Because the tree itself has a value of more than 11 million dollars', 'Because the tree has unique religious sensibility in the United Arab Emirates.', ""Because the jewellery hung around the tree's branches gives it a record value.""]","Why is the Christmas tree said to be ""the most expensive Christmas tree ever""?","Christmas came in extravagant  fashion to the Muslim desert emirate  of Abu Dhabi as a shining hotel uncovered a bejeweled  Christmas tree valued at more than 11 million dollars on Wednesday.
It is ""the most expensive Christmas tree ever"" with ""a value of over 11 million dollars"", said Hans Olbertz, general of Emirates Palace Hotel, at its inauguratuion .
The 13-metre (40-foot) evergreen, located in the gold hall of the hotel, is decorated with silver and gold bows, ball-shaped decorations and small white lights. But the necklaces, earrings and other jewellery hung around the tree's branches are what give it a record value. ""It holds a total of 181 diamonds, pearls, sapphires and other precious stones,"" said Khalifa Khouri, owner of Style Gallery, which provided the jewellery.
""The tree itself is about 10,000 dollars,"" Olbertz said. ""The jewellery has a value of over 11 million dollars--I think $1,141,150.""
""This will probably be an entry into the Guinness book of world records,"" Olbertz said, adding that Emirates Palace planned to contact the organization about the tree which is to stay until the end of the year. 
Asked whether the tree might be against religious sensibilities in the United Arab Emirates, where the vast majority of the local population are Muslim, Olbertz said he did not think it would. ""It is a liberal  country,"" he said.
The hotel has had a Christmas tree up in previous years, but this year ""we have to do something different"", and the hotel's marketing team  _ the plan, said Olbertz.",high21104.txt
