After school he walks past the shop on the street corner. He looks at the window. That pair of trainers is still there. He really wants to have them very much.
He was very sad and walks away. He knows his mother can give him anything he likes if she can. But he also knows she has no money and the trainers are too expensive. He doesn't go home at once because his mother could notice   his worry. So he goes to the park and sits on the grass. Then he sees a boy in a wheel chair   . He finds that the boy moves the wheel with his hands. Tom looks at him carefully and is surprised to see that the boy has no feet. He looks at his own feet. ""It's much better to be without shoes than without feet."" he thinks. There is no reason   for him to feel so sorry and sad. He smiles and thinks he is happier.",middle1170.txt
