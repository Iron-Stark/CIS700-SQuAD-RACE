3,C,"['Coffee stores have spread to small towns in India.', 'Some foreign coffee companies are trying to open Indian coffee market.', 'Local people worry about losing profit on tea.', 'Indians drink eight times more tea than coffee.']",Which statement is wrong according to the passage?,"India is traditionally a tea-drinking country. But, it is now gaining a new taste for coffee. This has led international coffee companies to consider opening businesses in the huge market.

""We have a lot of break between classes, so whenever we get time, we just go and we enjoy ourselves. It's a lot of fun , especially when you are with people you enjoy spending time with.""
In the past ten years , cafes have become increasingly popular in India. The country's huge young population have quickly taken to the coffee culture.
Coffee stores have spread from major cities like New Delhi and Mumbai to smaller towns. Coffee use has doubled in the last ten years . It is the success of this market that has gained the attention of companies like the American-based coffee chain Starbucks. The company will open its first store in India later this year. Other companies like Lavazza and Costa Coffee are already there.
Yet, the growth of coffee will not reduce the popularity of tea. Indians drink eight times more tea than coffee. They have been drinking tea for more than one hundred and fifty years. India is one of the world's biggest producers of tea, which is known locally as ""chai"". Outside homes and offices, it is mostly sold by small businesses on the street.",high290.txt
