He liked to play jokes on his friends. One day one of his friends lost his wallet  and asked Mark Twain to pay his train ticket for him.
""But I don't have enough money to pay both your ticket and mine,"" Mark Twain said. The friend didn't know what to do.
   ""We can do this,"" said Mark Twain."" We can get on the train and when the conductor came to check the tickets , you can hide under my seat.""
Later, however, when the conductor came to check the tickets, Mark Twain gave him two tickets --- one for himself and one for his friend . Then he explained in aloud voice,"" My friend is a strange man. When he travels on a train, he does not like to sit on the seat."" Of course everyone in the train looked at the poor friend under the seat and laughed at him loudly.",high17689.txt
