However, a true BFF helps out when the other is in trouble, not just once or twice, but for a lifetime.
Milo is six years old. He has become Eddie's BFF. They are special because they are not humans, but dogs. Their owner, Angie Baker, brought them up. They spent many years playing together.
However, last year, Eddie suddenly started walking into dustbins and walls. Soon he lost his eyesight. When Milo felt something was wrong, he decided to act as Eddie's ""guide"" dog. He leads Eddie through the house. When they go for walks, he holds Eddie's leash  .
Once, Milo had to spend a few nights at the hospital himself. Poor Eddie often bumped   into walls and furniture. Ever worse, he got lost during walks. Angie realized how much Eddie depended on his friend. Luckily, Milo is now fine and back at his BFF's side, guiding him through life again.",middle3093.txt
