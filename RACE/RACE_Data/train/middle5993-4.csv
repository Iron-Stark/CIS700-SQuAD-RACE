4,B,"['Jane bought the gas for Mr Zimmerman', 'usually Jane delivered papers by bike', ""Mr Robert Didn't like Jane at school"", 'Mr Zimmerman had to leave the car for Jane']",The reading doesn't say but we can infer that  _  .,"It was just three degrees above zero.""That's cold"", thought Jane as she got ready to deliver her morning papers . Jane had 50 customers ,and on cold mornings when she couldn't ride her bicycle , it took her more than an hour to make her rounds.
As she collected her papers and put them into a big canvas bag , Jane regretted that she hadn't finished her maths homework the night before . There was still time . She would hurry with the papers and finish the maths before breakfast.
Less than an hour later Jane nearly finished. She had only five customers to go.
She could then go home to finish her maths homework while her Mom cooked breakfast . As she rounded the corner , she saw a car in the middle of the street . It was Mr Zimmerman , the elderly man who walked with a walking stick . His car was out of gas .
""I'd like to help Mr Zimmerman,"" thought Jane ,""but if I do , I won't have time to do my homework."" She hated to think what Mr Robert would say if she didn't finish  papers.
""It's his own fault for running out of gas,"" Jane talked to herself. ""The station is only a half mile down the street . Surely Mr Zimmerman can walk that far, even on a cold morning like this...can't he?"" As she walked down the street , Jane still wondered what to do.",middle5993.txt
