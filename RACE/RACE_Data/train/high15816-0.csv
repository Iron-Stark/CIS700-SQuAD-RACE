0,A,"['hutong days realize my desires to live a local life .', 'Trishaw is the only way to visit the hutong', 'living in the hutong with other visitors', 'exploring the deeper of Beijing']",The main idea of the passage is about    _   .,"I first visited hutong as part of a tourist group several years ago. We rode on a trishaw  with a guide explaining the history, architecture and lifestyle of the local inhabitants.
Having visited the ""must-sees"" of Beijing, like the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven, the Drum Tower and the Summer Palace, going into the hutong home of some famous ancient families gave the ""Beijing experience"" a human element.
My curiosity has sharpened over the years from reading about them at every opportunity. During the preparation for the Olympics, I was eager to learn that some siheyuan courtyards in hutong were turned into accommodations for visitors. I wished to stay in one someday.
Preparing for a recent trip to the capital, I eagerly sought one out. On my limited teacher's salary, I settled on an affordable option, though I looked longingly at the more
courtyard accommodations.
As usual, by not being able to go upmarket, I ended up having something closer to a true experience. A real family still lives in the courtyard, which is closer to the original. The rooms all opened into the central courtyard. Flowers were blooming, beans and peas were climbing up the bamboo fence, and the cat was napping in the sun. Every day after exploring the city, I'd hurry back to the hutong, take a quick shower and join the cat - snoozing in a bamboo-made chair with a book ready nearby.
As the other guests came back we'd greet one another. There was a mother and young daughter from France, a guy from Canada, a mother and teenage daughter from the Netherlands, a teacher from England and several guests from various parts of China.
Coming and going through the narrow alleys of the hutong, the residents would smile and give cheery ""ni hao"" (hello). Laughing children were playing under the watchful eyes of the neighbors. I felt right at home in this friendly neighborhood.",high15816.txt
