1,B,"['She ate little food every day.', 'One of her legs hurt.', 'Her hands were both hurt.', 'Her head hurt badly.']",What was wrong with the old woman?,"One cold winter morning, an old woman had to go to see her doctor. When she walked into the doctor's office, she told him that her right leg hurt and sometimes she could not walk. She asked him what was wrong. She told him that she had never had such a feeling before.
The doctor checked the old woman carefully, then he said, ""You're in good health for a woman of your age. I think the trouble in your right leg is just a matter of old age catching up with you. We get all kinds of illness as we get older. The trouble will almost certainly end in spring.""
""I don't think so, doctor!"" she said. ""My left leg is well, and it's the same age as my right one.""",middle898.txt
