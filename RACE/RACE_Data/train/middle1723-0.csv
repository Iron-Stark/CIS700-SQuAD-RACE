I am unhappy these days.I am a student in Grade 3 of a middle school. I want to be a policewoman in the future.  But my mother doesn't like the job. She always  says it is too dangerous for a girl to work as a policewoman. She thinks girls should work in the office. She hopes that I can work as a teacher. But I really dislike being a teacher. I don't like work with children. When I talk with her about it , she is often angry. She always thinks she is right. I don't know what to do. Can you help me?
Yours,
Lily",middle1723.txt
