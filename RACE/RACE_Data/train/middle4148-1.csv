1,B,"['The kangaroo drove their car away.', 'They had to walk in the endless desert.', 'Chris had another key to the car.', 'The writer should buy a new jacket for Chris.']",What can you most probably conclude  from the last sentence of the passage?,"Some years ago, I went to Australia for a meeting with my friend, Chris. We decided to drive across country to Brisbane to visit another friend after the meeting ended.
The first day we were excited and laughed at each other's jokes. By the third day of driving in the endless desert, we began to get bored. We had been quiet for a few hours when suddenly Chris saw some kangaroos. We were both excited and decided to get a closer look. Chris _ to catch up with the kangaroos. We got closer and closer, and Chris was doing 110 kilometers per hour. We were very close to the kangaroos--too close--when we heard a loud BANG!
Chris stopped the car and we got out. Behind the car was a large kangaroo lying still on the ground. Chris went over to the kangaroo and put his baseball cap on its head. He took off his sunglasses and put them on the kangaroo and did the same with his jacket. Then he put his arm around the kangaroo and told me to take a photo of them together. I was still in shock, but I took out my camera. While I was taking the photo, I saw the kangaroo move. It suddenly woke up, looked at Chris, and jumped away into the distance before we could do anything.
I started laughing but Chris looked very serious. He said his purse and passport  were in the jacket. I started laughing even harder. I stopped laughing, however, when he said our car keys were also in the jacket.",middle4148.txt
