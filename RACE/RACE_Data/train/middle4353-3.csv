I'm a middle school student. I have lessons from Monday to Friday. At weekends, I usually get up very late. I wash my face, brush my teeth and then go out to do morning exercises. I eat my breakfast at about nine o'clock. After that, I often go to the park with my parents. The park is a little far from our home, so we go there by bus. It often takes us about twenty minutes to get there by bus. The park is very beautiful. There are always lots of people in the park. There are men and women, old and young. Parents must take good care of their children. There is a large lake in the middle of the park. I often go swimming there. Sometimes, I fly kites. We always have a good time there.",middle4353.txt
