2,B,"['Crouch refused to take another dog.', 'Crouch must be sad after losing her dog.', 'Crouch has accepted another dog from a stranger.', ""Crouch can live well without a dog's company.""]",We can infer from the passage that  _  .,"There has been an outpouring of love for a 23-year-old disabled woman whose dog was killed in front of her while a groomer  tried to trim  its claws.
Calls and e-mails came from as far away as the Upper Peninsula and Arizona as well as Oakland and Macomb counties, offering Laurie Crouch, who uses a wheelchair because of multiple sclerosis , everything from dogs to money, such as that from Jason Daly of Roseville who said, "" I would like to buy her a new dog.""
A story about the death of Crouch's pet, Gooch, was printed on the front page of Macomb Daily. Crouch said a man sat on the dog to trim its nails. Gooch died after one claw was trimmed.
Crouch yelled at the groomer to stop when she saw Gooch was struggling to breathe, but she said she was ignored. ""If I could have walked, I would have put my hands on her and pulled her off my dog and physically stopped her, but I can't do that."" Gooch was not a trained service animal, but naturally helped Crouch by picking up things for her.
""This case is absolute animal abuse ,"" Larry Obrecht, division manager of the Oakland County Animal Shelter in Auburn Hills, said.
People who read the story contacted Oakland Press to offer help. A message, from Rebecca Amett of Giggles N Wiggles Puppy Rescue, in Roseville, said, ""We have puppies to donate ... and want to help the young woman who lost her service dog.""
""When Gooch was with me, I was happy,"" Crouch said, ""I think I can be happy again but no animal can replace Gooch. There's never going to be another Gooch out there but I think I will find a dog that can bring me joy again.""",high7107.txt
