1,A,"['A new invention for Olympics', 'A new generation of cell phones', 'Watching live games on TV for free', ""People's Olympics""]","The best title for this passage would be ""  _  "".","With another invention in use, viewers will be also able to watch TV while walking to the office, taking a bus or simply waiting in line for lunch.
A Beijing-based company named Innofidei Inc. claims to have developed the first mobile TV chip for the market, which can change hundreds of thousands of mobiles into micro-TVs.
With this chip, people can receive TV signals on their phones and watch programs without any time or space limitations.""As long as the handset terminal  has a colored screen and a battery, our chip can turn it into a mobile TV,"" said Meng Fei, director of Innofidei's business development department. The chip can be placed into a cell phone, a PDA, an MP4, a digital camera or even a laptop. He said that this, together with plans by China's state broadcaster, would ensure the 2008 Games lives up to its promise as a ""People's Olympics"".
""Our chips are cheap so that cell phones with them will not be much different in price from regular phones,"" Meng said. ""CCTV will offer some free channels during the Games, so people can enjoy the Olympics for free.""
SARFT  is planning to build a regional test network in Beijing and hopes to start trials as soon as possible. The goal is to deploy CMMB   on a national level by the first half of 2008.
Innofidei is now busy selling their chips to cell phone makers so that the new generation of phones reaches the market in early 2008.
""Our invention successfully combines the good points of the two best-selling consumer products in history--TV sets and cell phones, "" said Meng. ""In the near future, soccer fans won't be tearing their hair out because they are stuck in traffic and missing the chance to see their favorite team's play.""
Local baseball fans, meanwhile, will be able to draw comfort from the knowledge that--both at the Olympics and afterwards--their teams will be playing on a field designed to help recycle water.",high8405.txt
