2,B,"['If you haven`t much money , you can`t get more happiness', 'You may live a long life even if you are poor', 'Every year many people die in the world because their family is poor', 'If you are rich ,you`ll have less friendship']",Which sentence of the following is true according to the passage ?,"In today's world many people seem to be hungry for money. Money does have its most useful effect on the poor. But once a person has a rich life, a lot more money doesn`t mean more happiness.
If money were everything, all millionaires  would have real love, true friendship, good health and a long life. However, this is not always true .But can love be bought ?I`m afraid not . Love means to give , not to take . To every person , health and long life are probably the most precious things . Well , can health and a long life be bought with money ? The answer is ""No"".
Of all the longest living people in the world, few of them are millionaires. True friendship can't be bought, either. In a word, where money is dreamed too much, it can cause brothers to quarrel, marriage to end, lovers to hate, and strangers to fight. No matter how much money you have, it is still not enough to make a happy person if you have no one to laugh with, no one to cry for.
