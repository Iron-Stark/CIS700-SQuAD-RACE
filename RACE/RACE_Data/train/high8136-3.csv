3,D,"['Middle schools are faced with challenges today.', 'A school with high enrollment can do well.', 'Computers are of importance in modern education.', ""Laptops can help improve students' school performance.""]",What is the passage mainly about?,"Carmen Arace Middle School is situated in the town of Bloomfield,but four years ago it faced many of the same challenges as inner--city schools nearby:low scores in standardized tests and dropping enrollment of students.Then the hard-driving headmaster, Delore Bolton,persuaded her school to shake up the place by buying a laptop computer for each student and teacher to use in school and at home.For good measure,the board provided wireless Internet access at school.Total cost :$5 million.
Now an hour before classes start,every seat in the library is taken by students eager to get online.The teacher talks about rocks as students view them at a colorful website,after school students on buses pull laptops from backpacks to get started on homework.Since the computers arrived,scores in state tests are up 35%and the enrollment increases by 20%.
Indeed,school systems in rural areas are eager to follow Carmen Arace Middle School's example.Angus King,the state governor, has proposed using$50 million from an unexpected budget to supply computers for students.
However, the school is seeking federal grant money to expand the laptop program.In the meantime,most of the problems have been worked out.Some students use computers to visit unauthorized websites,but teachers have the ability to track where students have been and restrict them.""That is the worst when they disable you"" says a boy.The habit is rubbing off on parents.""I taught my mom to use e-mail.""says the honorable girl.""And now she is taking computer classes.I'm so proud of her!''",high8136.txt
