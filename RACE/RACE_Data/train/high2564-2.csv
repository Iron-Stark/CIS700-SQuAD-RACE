When he got home, he went to his room and put them on. He found that they were about two inches too long. He went into the kitchen, and his mother and two sisters were doing some washing there. He said to them, ""The new trousers are too long. They need cutting by two inches. Would one of you mind doing this for me?"" His mother and sisters were busy and none of them said anything.
But as soon as his mother had finished washing up, she went to her son's room silently and cut the trousers by two inches. She came back without saying anything to her daughters. After supper, the elder sister remembered her brother's trousers. She went to his room and cut the trousers by two inches without saying anything to anyone. The younger sister went to the cinema. But when she came back, she also remembered her brother's trousers. So she went to his room and cut them by two inches, too.",high2564.txt
