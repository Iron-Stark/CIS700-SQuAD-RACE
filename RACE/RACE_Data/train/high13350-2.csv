About the Brookfield Zoo:
The Brookfield Zoo is located just 14 miles west of downtown Chicago. It's home to a variety of animal species, and its use of natural barriers and moats  is so much more relaxing and enjoyable than watching a lion pace back and forth in a cage. The absence of bars also makes for great wildlife photo opportunities. The Brookfield Zoo also focuses on education, with detailed displays about the animals being viewed and the interactive program that lets kids get some hands-on experience to learn what it takes to run a zoo as well as face painting and crafts.
