While she was trying on different styles, my neighbor took the manager aside. ""When she picks out a pair that she likes,"" he said, ""Just tell her that the price is 12 dollars. I'll pay the regular price. I don't care how much it is.""

""What's the problem?"" asked my neighbor as he entered the store.
""Wasn't my check any good?""
