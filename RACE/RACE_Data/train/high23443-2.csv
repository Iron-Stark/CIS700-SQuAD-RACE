2,B,"['paid for his gas with the help of his wife', 'felt stupid for having mistaken the gas price', 'went to the gas station together with his wife', 'was not allowed to use the coupon that day']",We know from the passage that the young man   _  .,"Many years ago a kind farmer bought a tank   of gas for a mom with two children. He didn't accept any money but just smiled and said, ""Pass it on to someone else."" The mom was my mother. After many years, I had a similar experience.
    A few weeks ago as my husband and I were filling up our car with a coupon   for 99 cents a gallon, I got into a long line to pay. I could see that the young man before me was having some kind of problem; I quickly realized that he had misunderstood the coupon and thought it was 99 cents to fill his small truck.
    Everyone was saying, ""99 cents a gallon is so cheap - they can't give the gas away."" He was embarrassed and was just calling his wife when I got to the counter  . He said to his wife, ""Just come here because I don't have enough money on me."" I asked the cashier   how much his was, and she told me.
    I told her I would pay for it and touched the man on the arm and told him to tell his wife it had been paid for. He nodded and turned back to the phone, then stopped and looked at me. ""What?"" I told him again, and I was so surprised to see everyone stop what they were doing to watch me as if I had just grown another head. When he asked how he could give the money back to me, I just said, ""Pass it on to someone else in need!""",high23443.txt
