0,B,"['possible to find an exact one like that pearl', 'difficult to get the matching pearl', 'impossible to advertise in the newspapers', 'easy to buy a similar pearl']",Both the man and the jeweller thought it   _  .,"A well-dressed man came into a famous jewellery shop. He explained that he wished
to buy a pearl  for his wife's birthday and that the price didn't matter since business
had been very good for him that year. After examining a number of beautiful and valuable
pearls, he chose a nice black one that cost $5,000. He paid for the pearl, shook hands with
the jeweller and left.
     A few days later the man returned and said his wife had liked the pearl so much that
she wanted another one just like it. It had to be exactly the same size and quality as she
wanted a pair of earrings   made. ""Can you give me any advice on how to get such a 
pearl?"" said the man. The jeweller replied, ""I would say it's nearly impossible to find an 
exact one like that pearl.""
     The rich man asked the jeweller to advertise  in the newspapers, and 
offered $25,000 for the matching pearl. Many people answered the ad , but nobody
had a pearl that was just right. Just when the jeweller had given up hope, a little old lady  
came in. To his surprise, she pulled the wonderful pearl from her handbag. ""I don't like to 
sell it,"" she said sadly. ""I inherited  it from my mother, and my mother inherited 
from hers. But now I really need the money.""
     The jeweller was quick to pay her before she changed her mind. Then he called the
rich man's hotel to tell him the good news. The rich man, however, was nowhere to be
found.",high21012.txt
