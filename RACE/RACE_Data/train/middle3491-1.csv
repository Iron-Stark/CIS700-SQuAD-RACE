Jay and Victor had been friends since they were little children. Now they were studying in a school which was far away from their village. They had to cross a river, climb hills and go through sandy areas on their way to school.
One rainy day, the two friends went to school as usual. They were chatting while walking. Perhaps they were discussing something important, but the two had different opinions, which led to a big argument. Things got so bad that Jay suddenly hit Victor. Then Victor looked at his friend and wrote in the sand, "" Today, my best friend hit me."" They both continued walking without saying anything . Later, they reached a river. Victor was not a good swimmer. By accident, he fell into the river and was going to be carried away by the water. Jay saw this and jumped into the river at once. With difficulty he pulled victor out of the river when Victor became safe, he wrote on a stone, ""Today, my friend saved my life.""
Jay, who was watching all this, asked,""So way did you write it in the sand when I hit you, and why did you write on a stone when I saved your life?"" Victor replied, "" we should soon forget the wrong done by our friends as words in sand get _ easily, but if they do something good for us, we should always remember their kindness, just as words in stones are kept forever."" Then the two friends walked on as if nothing had happened.",middle3491.txt
