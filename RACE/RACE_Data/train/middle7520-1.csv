1,C,"['study', 'sing', 'read', 'dance']",They often   _   on a bus or in a train.,"In England, people don't usually talk too much. You can go on a bus, or in a train, and everyone sits looking out of the windows. Often they read. They read books and newspapers. But they don't talk much.
When you meet English people, they often talk about one thing, the weather. So when you meet someone in England, you say: ""Nice weather for the time of year!""
""But it was a little colder yesterday ,"" someone may say.
""But it will be a little warmer later!"" You can say.
