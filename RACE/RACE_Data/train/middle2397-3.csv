3,C,"['I will go out of prison very soon.', 'You can plant potatoes now, dear mother.', ""I can't help you, dear mother."", 'The guards will plant potatoes.']",What would it say in Jim's second letter?,"Jim is a young farmer. He was once put into prison( ).
One day, he got a letter from his mother. "" I'm so worried about our farm,""she wrote.""it's time to plant potatoes. I can't dig ( ) all the fields( ) by myself.""
Jim read the letter and became sad. "" What can I do?"" he thought. Then he had a good idea. He wrote to his mother,"" don't dig the fields. There is much money in the earth. Don't plant potatoes until I come home.""
Some days later, Jim got another letter from his mother. It said, "" Two days ago, about ten men came to our farm and dug all the fields. I can't understand it. It seemed that they were looking for something. What should I do?""
Jim smiled when he read his mother's letter. He wrote a letter to his mother at once. It was very short. Guess what it would say.",middle2397.txt
