Also people remember you because of your humour. But I think I don't have a very good sense of humour. Could you suggest how to build on this?
----Radha Karnik
This is a great question that is unfortunately difficult to answer. I can only give you my views on this topic, which may or may not be correct. I know that my sense of humour developed over time.
When I was younger I was not funny at all, now I can easily make people laugh. At the same time, sometimes I say things that I think are very funny but others do not. Improving wit and humour, I believe, is an ongoing process.
Now, there are various forms of humour and everyone has their individual style. Overall, I believe being fluent in a language is very important for being witty or funny. The way we play around with words adds the ""funny"" tag to an otherwise normal sentence.
Also, seeing irony is very important. I think humour is often the link between two unrelated things.
In my experience, laughing frequently and appreciating other people's jokes and wit are very important. Within these, finding humour in everyday normal situations is the key.
I often notice what is going on around me and say funny things in my head and laugh to myself. That serves almost as practice for when I am in a group. I watch comedy shows and movies and I am sure that has some effect on helping me improve my sense of humour.
And last, having confidence that you are witty is important. There will always be someone wittier or funnier than you, which is fine. Just work on building your own style.
Remember, if you are trying to be funny and witty in order to break the ice at a business function, be careful.
In those situations, humour has to be mild and politically correct.
