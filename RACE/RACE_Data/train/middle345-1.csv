1,D,"['when he reads newspapers and story books', 'when he reads something most useful to him', 'when he is trying to work out a maths problem', 'when he is trying to find something for his report']",A good reader may read fastest  _  .,"A good reader is very much like a driver. He must change his reading speed to fit what he is reading and what he is reading for, just as a driver does to fit the road situation.
A good reader may read at 1,000 WPM(... )when he looks for something for a report in the library. But once he finds what he needs, he may slow down to 100 WPM. A good reader may read newspapers and story books at 600 WPM. But he may read his science or maths books at 150 WPM. Just as a driver has a wide change of driving speed, so a good reader has a wide change of reading speed.",middle345.txt
