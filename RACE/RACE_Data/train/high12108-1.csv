1,C,"['It is her favorite country.', 'She likes Mexican sugary drinks.', 'She tries to show a tax can help a lot.', 'It produces all kinds of sugary drinks.']",Why does Johnson talk about Mexico?,"Over the years, many cities and states have tried to put a tax  on sugary drinks. Last week, Berkeley, California succeeded. The city in northern California will charge a penny-per-ounce tax on most sugary drinks. The tax is expected to raise more than $1 million every year to fight against obesity .
Makers of sugary drinks are against the tax. They say picking out one product will not solve the obesity problem in America. They also argue that a tax is an attack on personal freedom. ""Families should be able to make the choice for their kids without the government stepping in,"" said Chris Gindlesperger, a spokesperson for the American Beverage Association .
Gindlesperger says that the fight against obesity is more successful when the government partners with industry. He shows how the beverage industry worked with President Bill Clinton's administration is the 1990s. They introduced water, milk, and fruit juice into a large number of schools, which took the place of sugary drinks. More recently, the beverage industry listened to First Lady Michelle Obama's suggestion that labels on sugary drinks be clearer. Containers of up to 20 ounces will show the total calories on the front.
Some people say a tax is a _ way to help reduce obesity in the U.S. ""There is clear evidence that taxes result in less consumption  of sugary drinks,"" says Dr. Rachel Johnson, a spokesperson for the American Heart Association. She points to Mexico as an example. The country put up a tax on sugary drinks in January, and sales have already dropped by 10%. What's more, sales of healthier drinks have increased. Bottled water sales are up by 13%. Milk sales are up by 7%.
Another purpose of the tax is to raise money to fight childhood obesity. Money will be used to build playgrounds, create educational materials, and increase the sales of the healthier foods. ""We've already helped reduce obesity to some degree,"" says Dr. Johnson. ""I'm confident that we're going to see even bigger progress soon.""",high12108.txt
