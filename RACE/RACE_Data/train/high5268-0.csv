0,B,"['1865', '1871', '1877', '1878']",Kipling first left his parents in   _  .,"Joseph Rudyard Kipling, who enjoyed early success with his poems, was born on 30 December 1865 in Bombay, India. Some of Kipling's earliest and fondest memories are of his and sister Alice's trips to the fruit market with their woman servant, or walking with his parents alongside the sea at night.
The beautiful days were to end when in 1871 Rudyard and Alice were sent to school in Southsea, England, to live with Captain Holloway and his wife. She ruled the boarding house with punishment and Kipling was often beaten by her and her son. ""Then the old Captain died, and I was sorry, for he was the only person in that house as far as I can remember who ever threw me a kind word."" So he wrote in his later books. Kipling soon learned to read and found comfort in literature and poetry.
Freedom from the Holloway household was gained when he spent one month a year in London with his mother's kind sister Aunt Georgie and her husband, pre-Raphaelite painter Edward Burne Jones and their children. _ 
In 1877 Kipling's mother returned to England and collected him so that he could attend the United Services College in Devon. Now he was able to settle into the life of a student and in his second year started writing his own Schoolboy Lyric poems printed by his parents. In 1878 his father took him to the Paris Exhibition where he was allowed to wander freely and gained much appreciation for French culture which he wrote about in ""Souvenirs of France"".",high5268.txt
