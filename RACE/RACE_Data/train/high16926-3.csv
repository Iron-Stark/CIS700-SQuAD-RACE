MANY of us spent our childhoods dreaming of becoming astronauts. However, the hard reality is that only a select few will make it. But does that mean you'll never get the chance to work in space? Not necessarily.
    Space X, a private space company based in California, US, published a list of job vacancies   last month. These ""open positions"" are not only for astronauts, and they all sound just as cool.
One of the most interesting space jobs that you may have never heard of is ""chief sniffer"" . NASA has already hired a chief sniffer named George Aldrich, whose job is to smell materials and components before they are used in spacecrafts.
Using your nose at work might sound a little strange, but the job is actually crucial. A spacecraft is of limited size and  ly  high temperature, which makes smells stronger inside of it. And once a spacecraft is launched, astronauts ""have no way of escaping"" unpleasant smells, Aldrich told The Telegraph. 
More importantly, smelling objects can help identify dangerous chemicals   that could threaten astronauts' health.
Another job vacancy, the ""space tour guide"", may seem a little ahead of its time --after all, what's the point of hiring a tour guide when there aren't any tourists there? But in fact, many private companies are now providing space trips, and wealthy space enthusiasts   such as Justin Bieber and Sarah Brightman have already signed up for tours. It may not be long before space becomes one of the top travel destinations for Earthlings. 
Being a space tour guide requires  rich knowledge of astronomy  , astrophysics   geography and history to help passengers get the most out of their journey. Tour guides also need to be excellent storytellers so that passengers can experience the true awe   of space travel.
Astronauts often spend weeks or even months in a small capsule with the same group of people, which is why a ""space psychologist"" is also needed to help astronauts overcome mental challenges like feeling bored and lonely.
""We're crossing the boundaries   between science fiction and reality,"" said Rohit Talwar, chief executive of US company Fast Future Research. ""Things we've seen in the past in movies are now becoming genuine   career opportunities. """,high16926.txt
