2,B,"['Life in Finland', 'A Society with ""Foolish"" People', 'What a Life', 'Honest accounts of the Finns']",Which of the following is the best title of the passage?,"If you have a chance to go to Finland, you will probably be surprised to find how ""foolish"" the Finnish people are.
Take the taxi drivers for example. Taxis in Finland are mostly high-class Benz with a fare  of two US dollars a kilometer. You can go anywhere in one, tell the driver to drop you at any place, say that you have some business to attend to, and then walk off without paying your fare. The driver would not show the least sign of anxiety.
The dining rooms in all big hotels not only serve their guests, but also serve outside diners. Hotel guests have their meals free, so they naturally go to the free dining rooms to have their meals. The most they would do to show their good faith is to wave their registration  card to the waiter. With such a loose check, you can easily use any old registration card to take a couple of friends to dine free of charge.
The Finnish workers are paid by the hour. They are very much on their own as soon as they have agreed with the boss on the rate. From then on they just say how many hours they have worked and they will be paid accordingly.
With so many loopholes   in everyday life, surely Finland must be a heaven to those who love to _ . But the strange thing is, all the taxi passengers would always come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business; not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms. And workers always give an honest account of the exact hours they put in. As the Finns always act on good faith in everything they do, living in such a society has turned everyone into a real ""gentleman"".",high218.txt
