4,C,"['Help him carry the wire.', 'Lead him to the competition.', 'Refuse to let him in.', 'Give him a close inspection.']",What do you expect the official would do in the end?,"Angus MacLeod was fifty and he had spent his entire life as a shepherd in the remote mountainous region of northwest Scotland. He had never owned a radio or television nor had he travelled further than forty kilometres from his birthplace. His knowledge of the world was gained only from his brief trips to the village to sell his sheep and buy food. However, he had lately come to rely on the growing number of hill-walkers in the region as sources of international news.
In the spring of 1992, a Spanish student came across Angus high in the mountains. Eager to practise his English he engaged Angus in conversation. The student told Angus of the forthcoming Olympic Games in Barcelona. Excited by the student's colourful description of Spain and the Games, Angus decided to attend the event in person and two months later arrived in Barcelona.
The ticketless Angus stood outside the stadium with his canny brain working overtime, watching a growing number of individuals entering the stadium through a small entrance at the side. He noticed that they all seemed to be carrying objects. Perhaps they were workmen, he thought. He moved closer and watched.
Within minutes a thin young man came along carrying an extremely long pole. He approached the official at the door and said ""Pole Vault"". The official moved to the side and the man entered. Next came a heavy-set man with a spear. Angus wondered how a man could carry such a dangerous weapon in a modern city. The man shouted "" Javelin "" and was presently admitted. Angus was puzzled. Perhaps they were all connected with security. His puzzlement grew when a huge man appeared with a steel ball in his hand. He shouted ""Shot Putt"" and walked past the official.
It suddenly dawned on Angus that these people were competitors. He opened his programme and sure enough under the heading ""events"" he saw the three words the men had said. Angus laughed to himself as a plan began to take shape in his mind. First he needed to buy one or two things.
An hour later he reappeared dressed in a tracksuit with ""Scotland"" written across the chest. Over his shoulder he carried a roll of barbed wire  . Smiling to himself he walked up to the official and as casually as he could, shouted, ""Fencing!""",high21992.txt
