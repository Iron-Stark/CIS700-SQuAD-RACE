Some teenagers are crossing their dream colleges off their lists. Others are thinking of skipping their senior trips or reducing prom costs. Many are finding their work hours cut while their expenses rise.
So, who exactly is punishing them?Is it their parents, teachers or employers?No, it's the economy .
If you are like most teenagers, you probably don't understand what ""recession"", ""negative economic growth"" and ""subprime mortgage crisis  ""actually mean. And you probably don't spend your days watching the ups and downs of the stock market.
It's safe to say that most teens don't know much about the economy except for one thing:it's bad. But just how exactly is the economy affecting teens?
""The single largest thing I have noticed is the recession's ability to affect my college choice, ""said Heather Richars from Downey High School in California, US. ""With the economic situation the way it is, I have thought less about going to a private or out-of-state university, and more about public schools in California, mainly because of the price of tuition, ""said Richars. ""I had been a fan of attending a private school up until this year.""
The economy cuts into other areas of teenagers' lives, too.
Joey Camarda, a student at Modesto High School in California, who works at an ice cream store,  said,"" Probably due to the economy, I have been getting less hours at my job, and because of that, I am not getting enough money to help pay for college.""
Tara Mooney, a senior at Beyer High School, has also begun to notice that money is tight.
""Things are getting expensive,"" she said. ""When it comes to applying for colleges and wanting to go on senior trips, I have to pick and choose instead of doing it all.""",high2413.txt
