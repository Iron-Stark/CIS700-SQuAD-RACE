Tom,her brother,nodded.He wasn't able to go last year because he hadn't earned enough money during the summer.This year he came up with a plan.
He made a necklace for his mother that everyone admired.They were surprised to learn that Tom had made it for her.Why not make more necklaces and sell them?
""OK,"" said Mary,""The first thing you need to do is to figure out how much you have now.''
""I have $20.00 in the bank,and $7.25 in my room,"" explained Tom.
""That gives you a total of $27.25,"" said Mary,""That is called your capital.The next thing you need to know is how much it will cost you to make each necklace.""

""OK.If you sell each necklace for $ 6.00,you'll make a good profit on each then,"" said Mary.
""Hurray!"" Tom cried,""If I sell 20 necklaces,I'll have enough from the profit for the camping trip and $10.00 left over.""",middle2154.txt
