The class sit in a circle with their eyes shut and they count from one to ten: someone starts, the next voice comes from the far right, a third from the other side.

The Willy Hellpach School in Heidelberg is the first in the nation to develop a happiness course.
It is intended for students preparing for university entrance exams.
""The course isn't there to make you happy,"" Ernst Fritz-Schubert, the school principal, warned pupils, ""but rather to help you discover the ways to become happy.""

The course is taught for three periods a week. Although it's the happy subject, the pupils themselves insist it is no laughing matter.
