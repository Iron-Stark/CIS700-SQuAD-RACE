2,D,"['they no longer go hungry', 'they can take care of their parents', ""they don't have to worry about food"", 'they can learn more skills from their parents']",AIDS children can benefit from food rations in that  _  .,"The creative projects of World Food Program (WFP) focused on preventing hunger from taking hold in the future and breaking the cycle of hunger. Here are some of the ways in which we work to prevent hunger in the future:
School Meals
As well as directly addressing hunger, School Meals projects encourage families to keep their children in school and help them build better futures. If children aren't hungry they will concentrate on their lessons. With a solid education growing children have a better chance of finding their own way out of hunger. These projects benefit girls especially. For more information: www.wfp.org/schools meals.
Food for Assets 
WFP's Food for Assets projects provide the hungry with food to lay the foundation for a better tomorrow. When poor farmers no longer have to worry about the next meal, they have the time and energy to build irrigation  systems that can increase production. Similarly, Food for Training projects allow the poor to devote time to learning skills that will sustain  them economically in the future. For more information: www.wfp.org/food-assets.
HIV/AIDS
WFP uses its food rations  to reduce the blow of HIV and AIDS. The agency distributes its rations to people living with HIV and AIDS, so they can keep providing for their families for longer and have time to transfer vital knowledge and skills to the growing number of AIDS children--the next generation of food providers in developing countries.

Purchase for Progress
WFP buys large amounts of food in developing countries. It has this purchasing power and uses it to help poor farmers contact reliable markets where they can get competitive prices for their produce. With secure markets, farmers will be encouraged to produce more and innovate .The knock-on effect is producing more food for everyone.
