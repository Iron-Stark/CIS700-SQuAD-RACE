0,C,"['scientists', 'parents', 'the public', 'teachers']",Who is the passage mainly written for?,"This booklet is designed to help you and your family plan for and survive a major earthquake. By taking action to be prepared, you can lessen the impact of an earthquake on your family. Set aside some emergency supplies, and teach your family what to do at home during and after a disaster. You could be without help for up to 72 hours, so learn to cope for at least that long.
    Movement of the ground is seldom the actual cause of death or injury. Most casualties   result from partial building collapse and falling objects and debris, like toppling chimneys, falling bricks, ceiling plaster, and light fixtures. Many of these conditions are easily preventable.
    Because earthquakes occur without warning, it's important to take steps now to prepare, so that you know what you can do and how to respond--constructive, protective action is possible.
    Have on hand for Any Emergency- Ideas for Home, Workplace, and Car.
    Because you don't know where you will be when an earthquake occurs, prepare disaster supplies.",high21983.txt
