dancer.The 49--year--old recalls the injury that left her bedridden for six months when she was 21
years old and with constant pain for decades. However,the injury did lead her to tai chi,a martial
art typically practiced in slow motion .Her initial   hope was to improve her health.
She later married her instructor,Rey Nelson,and founded a school with him,teaching the
martial art to more than 10,000 students over eight years .But they found themselves in a bottleneck So the couple moved to shanghai in 2000 They taught English in universities and happily learned tai chi under various masers.After years of practice,Oliver found her occasional backaches had disappeared.
But her greatest pain came when her husband died in 2003 She thought of giving up But she carried on to honor her husband She founded the Double Dragon Alliance in 2005. The organization
enables Chinese kung fu masters to teach martial arts to Westerners and organizes seminars  and events for them to experience Chinese massage,acupuncture,traditional medicine calligraphy   and tea ceremonies
