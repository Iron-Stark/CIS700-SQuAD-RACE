Her parents loved her very much. Every morning, Mrs. Jackson would get up early to make breakfast. She also made lunch for Mr. Jackson. Then it was Molly's job to put her father's lunch box into a lunch bag. And she would give the lunch bag to her father.
One day, Molly gave two lunch bags to her father. ""Why do you give me two bags, Molly?"" asked Mr. Jackson.
""There is something else in the other bag,"" Molly answered.
""What's in it?"" Mr. Jackson kept asking. ""I can't tell you now. Just open it after your lunch,"" said Molly.
Time passed quickly, it was lunch time. Mr. Jackson opened his lunch bag and started to eat. Then he saw the other bag from Molly. So he opened this special bag.
In this bag, Mr. Jackson found some toys. There were some small model cars and pictures in the bag. And Mr. Jackson found a note  at the bottom  of the bag. It wrote, ""Dad, here are some of my toys. You can play them in your free time and have a rest. I love you, dad.""",middle2411.txt
