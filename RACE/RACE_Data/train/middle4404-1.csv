1,A,"['Sometimes.', 'Every day', 'Always.', 'Never']",How often does the writer send e-mails?,"6 June, Saturday
I read an article about people living in e-age yesterday. It talks about different ways of communicating like chatting on line, sending e-mails, sending different kinds of messages and keeping an online diary.
The article says that people nowadays send e-mails at least once a day. I don't agree with this because I send e-mail only twice a week. However, I do check my e-mail once a day. I like receiving e-mails.
About chatting online, the article says that chatting on line is becoming more and more popular among teenagers. I think this is true. Whenever I arrive at home, I turn on my computer and log on  to chat online with my friends. I prefer chatting online to calling a friend, because I can chat with many friends at the same time.
But I like using mobile phones. When I do not have my computer with me I can send short massages to my friends. I also like keeping in touch with them in this way.
I keep an online diary four times a week. I like telling others what has happened to me.
I think I am one of the people living in the e-age. I can live without computers or mobile phones.
What about you? Can you live without computers or mobile phones?
