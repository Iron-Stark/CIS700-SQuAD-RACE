The doctor said to me, ""The result isn't too bad ."" But you must excise often and have healthy food every day.  In fact, I'm a lazy person. I never get up early to exercise. And I often have junk food because I like it. In order to be healthy, I decided to change my lifestyle.    Now I get up at 6:00 am every day. Then I go out to run for about an hour. I go to a gym on Wednesday and Saturday afternoon. And I hardly have junk food. I have healthy food, like milk and fish. I often eat vegetables and I have an apple every day. You know, "" An apple a day keeps the doctor away "" I also have about eight glasses of water. And I usually go to bed by ten.  All these things make me healthy.",middle4654.txt
