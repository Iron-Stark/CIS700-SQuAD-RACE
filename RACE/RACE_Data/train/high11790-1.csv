Here are some general points regarding driving in New Zealand.
Visitors wishing to drive in New Zealand do not require an international driver's license but are required to carry their local driver's license whenever driving.
Vehicles drive on the left-hand side of the road as they do in Britain, Australia, and Japan. Most rental vehicles will have a sticker reminding you of this important fact.
When the traffic light is red, you must stop. There is no left turn rule as in North America.
New Zealand road rules follow international standards but please note that in New Zealand vehicles turning left must give way to traffic turning right.
In general, if you are turning left (where there are give-way signs or no signs), give way to vehicles that not turning. In all other situations, give way to vehicles crossing or coming from your right.
Seat belts must be worn at all times while driving in New Zealand. This stands for the driver and passengers. The driver is responsible for ensuring all passengers are wearing their seatbelts.
Do not drink alcohol before driving in New Zealand--drinking and driving laws are strictly enforced.
Speed limits are in kilometres per hour (kph), not miles per hour (mph).
Speed conversion: 1 kph equals 0.621 mph; 1 mph equals 1.61 kph.
The speed limit on the open road is 100km/h. In towns and cities the speed limit is 50km/h. Be sure to obey all school crossing speed reductions as speed cameras operate regularly throughout New Zealand.
