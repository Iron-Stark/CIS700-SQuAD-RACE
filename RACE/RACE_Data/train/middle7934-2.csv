First, I slept late and Mom shouted at me to wake up. When I went to the kitchen for breakfast, there was no cereal. I decided to have some toast instead, but I burned it. I had to eat it anyway because there was no more bread. The juice bottle was empty, so I had a glass of cold water.
When I was getting on a bus, I realized that I had forgotten my wallet, so I had to go back home to get it.
Of course, I missed the bus and had to wait for the next.
I was late for school and the teacher told me to stay in the classroom at lunchtime to catch up on  the school work I had missed. After lunch, it was time to give the teacher our homework. I reached into my bag to get it, but it wasn't there. I had left it at home. I was in trouble again.
