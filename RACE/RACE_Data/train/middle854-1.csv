1,D,"['We should take some medicine.', 'We should have a good rest.', 'We should stay at home and drink a lot of water.', 'All of the above.']",What should we do when we catch a cold?,"You may get a cold sometimes. It often starts with a sore throat. You sneeze   and your nose runs. You usually have a headache, too. Often you have a cough later. It's not a serious illness, but you may feel quite bad.
 _ For example, you can take aspirin   to get rid of   your headache. It is good to rest and drink a lot of water, too. A doctor once told me, ""With the right medicine, the cold will last for seven days. With no medicine, it will go on for a week!""
Where does our medicine come from? A long time ago, people knew that some plants made them feel better. For example, the juice of lemons   makes a sore throat better. Now, scientists find some parts of plants can make some medicine. Because of these medicines, people now live longer than their grandparents.",middle854.txt
