The so-called shopping method has become common practice these days, but that can put your wallet under a lot of pressure. So if you are sad and feel like shopping, don't!
According to the recent study, sadness leads to self-focus   thinking. In other words, sad people are willing to spend more money on the same thing than calm people.
""It is the result of sadness and self-focus, and it turns out that sadness leads to an increase in self-focus,"" said Cynthia Cruder. ""What we think is that sad and self-focused people are feeling pretty bad about themselves, and one way to deal with this is buying material goods.""
In a perfect situation, when you know you are sad, you should avoid  making decisions and spending money. Sounds simple? Sadly, it is not. Most people don't even know they're sad, the study shows, and they are not aware that their feelings influence their decisions.
What to do? The study showed that those who watched a tragedy  were more likely to spend three times more money for a simple bottle of water than those who watched a comedy. The solution: well, for starters, don't go shopping! If you can't help it, it is probably better to see a doctor.",high8827.txt
