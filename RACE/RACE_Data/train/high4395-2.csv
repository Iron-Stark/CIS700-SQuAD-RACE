2,D,"[""helps cure his father's disease"", 'is a good way to get close to nature', 'makes him realize the importance of relaxation', 'provides a chance for them to communicate']","For the author,fishing with his old father  _   .","As I grew older, my dad and I grew further apart.We always had totally different  opinions.He thought that college was a waste of time,but for me it was important to finish college.He wanted me to work my way to the top as he had done in his field,but l wanted a different life.There was a time when we did not talk with each other.
A few months ago, I heard that my 84-year-old dad was in poor health.When he called and asked whether I could move from Colorado back to Tennessee to help him,I knew he was seriously ill.I am his only child and so it was time to meet my father's requirement.
Two weeks after moving back,we bought a boat and started fishing again.Fishing was one of the few things that we did while l was young and that we both enjoyed.It is strange but true that as we are fishing we are able to put things that have kept us apart for so many years behind us.We are able to talk about things that we have never talked about before.Fishing has been healing the old wounds that have kept us apart.
It is not important how many fish we catch.It is about enjoying the relationship that we have not had for years.I'm 62 and he is 84.When we are on the lake fishing,it is like two kids enjoying life.It is far better to find a way to put the unhappy past behind.I am so lucky to spend the happy time with my father in his last years.Now my heart is filled with love.A smile always graces my lips.",high4395.txt
