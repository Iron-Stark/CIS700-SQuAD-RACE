2,D,"['Avatar was the first 3D movie.', 'All movies will be in 3D in the future..', 'Titanic 3D has made the most money.', '2012 witnessed more 3D movies than before.']",The following statements are all incorrect except  _  .,"3D cinema has been around since the early 20th century, but Hollywood brought the technology back in 2007. Many thought it was just a trick to make more money. But then came Avatar, the first must-see movie in 3D.
    But since Avatar, 3D cinema has struggled. In 2010, several 3D movies bombed at the box office. And by late 2010, Some people said the technology was dead. Of course, this isn't the first time Hollywood has struggled with new technology. In the late 1920s, sound was added to movies, but it took audiences a long time to get used to the new technology. And in the end, sound and color1 became the standard. James Cameron, director of Avatar, thinks we're going through the same process with 3D.
    Some say cinemas are charging too much for 3D movies. In the US, seeing a 3D movie can cost up to $7.5 more than seeing it in 2D. Also, a recent study at California State University found audiences don't actually enjoy movies in 3D any more than in 2D. Walter Murch, a famous movie editor, wrote in 2011 that human beings have no ability to process 3D images. Watching a 3D movie confuses our brain and this is why some people get headaches.
    But James Cameron disagrees. In fact, he recently predicted that in five years all movies will be in 3D. And there are signs that 3D is fighting back. More 3D movies were put on the market in 2012 than ever before. The Lion King 3D recently made over US $150 million at the box office, and Cameron's Titanic 3D made even more.
    Who knows what the future holds for 3D? Steven Spielberg recently said, ""I'm hoping 3D gets to a point where people don't notice it, because then it is just another tool and helps tell a story.""",high16828.txt
