It was an opportunity 19-year-old Jodi Sagorin felt she couldn't pass up.
The California student had received an admission letter to New York University, but she wanted to follow a calling to volunteer in India. When she got an offer to do just that, she decided there would be no better time to do it.
""It matches everything I'm interested in,"" she said. ""It's just one of those things; it was meant to be.""
Last month, Sagorin packed up her belongings and headed over to Uttar Pradesh as an intern  for Drishtee, an organization that works for the economic and social development for the needy in India.
During her stay in India -- for up to seven months -- Sagorin will help with programs involving micro-finance, entrepreneurship , healthcare and women's empowerment.
Since her younger days, Sagorin had read inspiring stories of change makers throughout the world and decided she wanted to get involved somehow.
She decided volunteering would be the path she'd take and NYU could wait. She wanted to make a difference even when others said it wouldn't be possible.
When Sagorin broke the news about deciding to put off college, her parents felt pride, nervousness, fear and excitement.
""We're really proud of her of wanting to do this,"" said Mike Sagorin, her father. ""We're a little concerned about a 19-year-old girl going out there by herself and hope she'll be safe.""
Sagorin and her family researched everything they could about the organization and bought more than a dozen books about the country.
Before her trip to India, Sagorin raised $3,500 to pay for her travel and living expenses, along with some to donate to the people she would work with in India.
She has promised to send various levels of gifts -- from a personal postcard to a personalized video touring the Taj Mahal -- to those who  _ money towards her trip.
