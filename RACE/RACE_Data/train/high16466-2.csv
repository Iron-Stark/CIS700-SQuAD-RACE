2,B,"['It was first given to Doris on a plane.', 'It is usually kept in their cupboard', 'It was made by hand by Mr. Ward.', 'It is sent to Doris by post every year.']",What do we know about the 70-year-old Valentine's Day card?,"There's no danger of 88-year-old Harry Ward forgetting his wife Doris's Valentine's Day card - the couple still use the same one he bought her 70 years ago.
When 17-year-old Harry Ward presented Doris with a Valentine's Day card as he boarded a train to join the wartime effort on February 14, 1941, he must have been fairly confident about his affections . After all the couple had been dating since they met in a cafe three months earlier.
But little can he have imagined that 70 years on, not only would he still be happy about having married Doris, but that every year she would present him with the very same card he gave her that Valentine's Day. ""I bring it out of the cupboard and put it on our mantelpiece every Valentine's Day,"" she said. ""It's a special to me now as it was 70 years ago. Harry has never bought me one since, because I have this one every year.""
They first met in a cafe. ""Harry was in the cafe drinking and he said hello. He asked me my name and we got talking happily. He offered to walk me to the bus stop but when we got outside, a bombing raid had started and we had to run to a nearby air-raid shelter ,"" Doris said.
Mr. Ward said,""I knew Doris was the one for me the moment I met her. I gave her the Valentine's card then and she is still my Valentine now."" Mrs. Ward's card is not the only thing that has endured the passing of time.
""Harry is quite romantic and we are as still in love as the day he first gave me this card,""Dorris said.",high16466.txt
