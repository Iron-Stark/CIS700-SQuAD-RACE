0,B,"['a story', 'an advertisement', 'a report', 'diary']",This passage is likely  _  .,"For children with cancer ,the facts of life include the facts of death.
There is always the fear that they might not live to grow up.Yet they realize that fighting cancer is the only way of beating it. So they fight.And sometimes, they win.It may take years.It certainly takes support from  parents and doctors.
Unfortunately, many parents can't deal with their child's illness.And doctors, no matter how caring, have other patients to care for. At times like these, the Children's Cancer Foundation can help. We are a group of Hong Kong doctors, nurses, psychologists, parents of children with cancer and concerned persons  .All of us are volunteers (offer one's help  without payment).We're with the children every day, listening to, and encouraging them.
We also advise parents, educate the public and send doctors overseas to study new cancer treatments. Our funding (providing money) has brought better equipment to the wards (large rooms of a hospital), and paid for special flats  where the children can recover.
We want to do even more.But to do it, we need your help. It will be money well spent.One who looks at our past achievements should prove that.
To the children, your contribution  will also be a show of support.A sign that you're behind them is just the sort of news that a six-year-old chlid with cancer needs to hear.",high20353.txt
