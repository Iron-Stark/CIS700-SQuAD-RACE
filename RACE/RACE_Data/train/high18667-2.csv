2,C,"['Boost Yourself to Another Level', 'A Young Woman and Her Mother', 'A Carrot, an Egg or a Coffee Bean', 'Survival of the Fittest']",What can serve as the best title of this passage?,"A young woman went to her mother and told her how hard life was. She was tired of struggling and fighting and wanted to give up.
So, her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Soon the pots came to boil. In the first she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and in the last she placed coffee beans. She let them sit and boil, without saying a word. In about twenty minutes she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out, pulled the eggs out and then poured the coffee into three different bowls.
Turning to her daughter, she asked, ""Tell me what you see."" ""Carrots, eggs, and coffee,"" she replied.
Her mother brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She noted that they were soft. The mother then asked the daughter to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard boiled egg. Finally, the daughter was asked to drink the coffee. She smiled as she tasted its rich fragrance.
The daughter then asked, ""What does it mean, mother?"" Her mother explained that each of these objects had
faced the same disaster but reacted differently.
The carrot went in strong, and hard. However, after being subject to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile, but after sitting through the boiling water, its inside became hardened. The coffee beans were unique, however; after they had been in the boiling water, they had changed the water.               
""Which are you?"" she asked her daughter. ""When misfortune or change knocks on your
door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg or a coffee bean?""
""Are you the carrot that seems strong, but with change and difficulty will you wilt   and become soft and lose your strength? Are you the egg that starts with a malleable  , heart, but changes with the heat? When faced with a death, a break-up, a financial hardship or other trial, do you become hardened and stiff? The coffee bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavour.""              
""If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and provide strength
and happiness for those around you. When the hour is the darkest and trials are their greatest, can you improve yourself to another level?""",high18667.txt
