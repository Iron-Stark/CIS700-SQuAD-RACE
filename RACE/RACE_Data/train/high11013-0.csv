Most Helpful Customer Reviews
Hello, my name is Mike Smith. I bought the raft for my family. It worked perfectly. It is a great size for the three of us. We hit many rocks and low tree branches drifting down a river, but the raft came out safety. This is an excellent raft. It's durable and floats like it should. Great for kids or adults. And great for family use.
