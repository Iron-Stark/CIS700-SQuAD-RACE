Mary said, ""White, sir. Because she is happy."" ""That is good, Mary."" Roger said, ""You are quite right. She wears white because she is happy.""
But then one boy in the class put up his hand. ""Yes, Dick?"" Roger said, ""Do you have a question?"" ""Yes."" Dick said, ""Why do men wear black in our country when they get married, sir?""",middle4467.txt
