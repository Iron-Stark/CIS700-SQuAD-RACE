""Finding a job"" is not the same as ""choosing a job"". Many young people end up in a job that they are not suited to do. ""Chance"" may play a more important part than ""decision"". So here are a few steps to help you think about jobs.
First, it is important to recognize what kind of person you are and what special qualities make you different from everyone else.
The most important thing is to know your interests and skills. But the point is that there is a difference between an interest and a skill. If you like art and enjoy looking at pictures, it is an interest. But if you can draw a horse that looks like a horse rather than a big dog, that is a skill. The best job is one that uses your skills in doing something together with your interests. As well as this,  it is an advantage if you believe that a particular job is worth doing in the world.
To examine your skills and abilities still further, ask yourself this question: in the following three areas--skills with people, skills with information or skills with things -- which are your best skills?
After that, the next step is research. To find out as much as possible about different kinds of work, go to the library and read books, magazines and newspapers. Ask your friends about the work they do. If you are interested in banking, it is better to talk to a bank clerk of twenty-four, rather than a bank manager of sixty-four. Do not ask your parents' friends for information. A younger person will be able to describe a normal day at work and tell you about the interesting or boring things when you first start working.
Finally, trust your own ideas and your own thinking! It is your own life, so find something that you enjoy doing.",high19233.txt
