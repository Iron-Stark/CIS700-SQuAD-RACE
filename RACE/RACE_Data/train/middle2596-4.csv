4,D,"['A 35-year-old man.', 'A 8-year-old girl.', 'A 90-year-old granny.', 'A 5-year-old boy.']",Who can't watch the movie?,"If you like adventurous  cartoons, then Koala Kid is the movie for you.
Koala Kid tells us a story of a white koala named Johnny. It lives in a community  of the gray koalas. He is not confident  because of his color. But he thinks he has special talents. So the goes on a magic trip.
On his trip he meets Miranda, Hamish and Lokie. And they become friends. They fight with their wits  against Bog.
I think this movie tells us: whatever   you look like, you can become a hero.
I give the movie five stars. It is a great movie for ages six and up. Because there are some scary parts in the movie, I wouldn't recommend  it to kids under the age of six.
