But although you probably use it all the time, have you ever thought about the manners related to talking on the phone? If you haven't, here are some tips to guide you.
*Always give the person you are calling plenty of time to get to the phone before you hang up. If the person who answers is not the one you want, give your name and ask if you may speak to the person you want.
*Think about the time you call people. Try not to call too early in the morning (before about 9:00) or too late at night (after about 9:30). Also try not to call at mealtimes.
*If you go by plane to visit your relatives at Christmas, remember to follow airline instructions. Cell phone must be turned off as soon as the plane doors are closed and remain so until the doors open again on arrival.
*When you're face to face with someone, do not talk on the phone. It is rude to be on the phone when a waiter is trying to take your order in a restaurant, or when you are returning the shoes you have just been trying on in a shop. Finish any face-to-face business before taking a call. Continuing to use the phone while nodding to the person in front of you is quite impolite.
*When in a restaurant with your friends, keep phone conversations short. Make a call only if it is important. Practice speaking in a low voice. If no one turns to your way, _ .
*If you go to a theatre, a concert or a cinema, consider the other people around you. Check that your phone is ""off"" before you enter. If you are expecting a very important call, put your phone on ""vibrate""  and run for the exit as soon as you feel it. If you forget both ""off"" and ""vibrate"" and your phone rings, don't answer it, turn it off straight away.",high9034.txt
