2,B,"['Elephants.', 'Koalas.', 'Giraffes.', 'Lions.']",What animals does Lucy like?,"My name is Jack. I come from the United States. Now I'm in China with my grandparents. There is a big zoo in our neighborhood. I like to spend time there on weekends.
On weekends, I often go to the zoo with my friends. We like different kinds of animals. I like elephants a lot because they are very smart. They can remember very well. Elephants can also draw very well. And elephants can do a lot of things for people. Lucy likes koalas. She thinks they are cute and interesting. Kate likes giraffes. She thinks they are smart and friendly. Bob likes lions. He thinks lions are exciting but scary.
We often spend all the day in the zoo and watch the animals. We sometimes take photos of them. They're our good friends.",middle7364.txt
