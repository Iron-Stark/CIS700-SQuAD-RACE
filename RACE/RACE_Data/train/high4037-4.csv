4,A,"[""Tom's"", ""Kate's"", 'Bath A and B', 'Neither A nor B']",Whose answer do you think is correct according to the law of physics?,"Miss Gogers taught physics in a New York school. Last month she explained to one of her classes about sound, and she decided to test them to see how successful she had been in her explanation. She said to them, ""Now I have a brother in Los Angeles. If I was calling him on the phone and at the same time you were 75 feet away, listening to me from across the street, which of you would hear what I said earlier, my brother or you and for what reason?""
Tom at once answered, ""Your brother. Because electricity travels faster than sound waves."" ""That's every good,"" Miss Gogers answered; but then one of the girls raised her hand, and Miss Gogers said. ""Yes, Kate.""
""I disagree,"" Kate said. ""Your brother would hear you earlier because when it's 11 o'clock here it's only 8 o'clock in Los Angeles.""",high4037.txt
