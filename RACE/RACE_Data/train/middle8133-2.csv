2,C,"['They cry sadly.', 'They just sit on the beach.', 'They start to build another one.', 'They start to sing.']",What do the children do after a big wave puts down the sandcastle?,"I am sitting on a beach on this hot summer day and watching two children,a  boy and a girl,playing in the sand.They are working hard at building a sandcastle .Just when they are successful, a big wave comes along and puts it down.
I think the children may cry because all their hard work turns to nothing, but they surprise me. They run up away from the water, hand in hand, and sit down to build another one.
They really teach me a lesson. We can't always be successful.Being sad is doing no good.What we need to do is to start again, hand in hand with our friends.",middle8133.txt
