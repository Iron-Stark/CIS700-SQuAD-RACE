4,B,"[""Tom's favorite teacher."", ""Tom's new classmate."", ""Tom's math class."", ""Tom's lunch.""]",What is the passage mainly about?,"On Thursday a new boy came into the classroom. He didn't have any uniform on. Just trousers, a jacket and a shirt. Tom could see that the boy wasn't quite comfortable. He had a plastic   bag with exercise books, pens, pencils, rulers and erasers in it. The boy stood at the blackboard. Mrs. Brown talked to the boy, and then she said, ""Boys and girls, this is Peter. He is your new classmate. Peter is your age. I hope you'll get on well with each other. Peter will spend a lot of time together with you.""Mrs Brown asked Peter to sit next to Tom at the desk near the window.
The students had math after that and Tom could see that Peter was not bad at it. He counted   well. It was not difficult for him at all. Then Mrs. Brown said,"" It is half past twelve. It's time to have lunch. ""Peter joined Tom and went to wash his hands. Then the boys sat down on the floor and started to open their lunch bags. Tom opened his bag and put his hand in it. He took out an old brown apple, some old cheese and some fish from dinner.""Oh, no!"" cried Tom."" This is rubbish. I have the wrong bag. I took the rubbish bag and left my lunch bag at home. I have only rubbish for lunch today."" The other children laughed and laughed. Then Peter said,"" I have two eggs. Why don't you have one? I don't need two. And would you like some bread?"" Tom smiled,"" Thanks. It's very kind of you.""",middle6745.txt
