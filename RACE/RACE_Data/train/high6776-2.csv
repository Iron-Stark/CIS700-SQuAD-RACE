2,C,"[""Where there is a will, there's a way."", 'A friend in need is a friend indeed.', 'Never judge a book by its cover.', 'Good is rewarded with good.']",What conclusion can we draw from the passage?,"I work in a busy Emergency Room( E. R. ) .  This weekend, I had a patient who was very nervousand paranoid.
After looking at his chart, I saw that he was seeking treatment for alcoholism. There is an immediate prejudice against substance abuse in my E. R. One -we do not have a detox  facility.The people seeking treatment for addiction are sometimes looked down on as being less worthy of treatment  than  other  serious  physical  "" ailments"" .
At first glance, I found out that the man was now somewhere in his mid-thirties, was very weak and had a generally aggressive character. He could not sit still and had a cough. He had not had a drink in four days. His hands were shaking and there was a scared look in his eyes.
He told me that he began drinking about age 11 when his mother supplied him with it. He had tried to quit many times before but had not been able to."" So .  what's different this time ?""I asked.
""Because I'm starting to be mean to the people I love, but now I don't want to be.  I ca:n see that  I'm changing into something else. ""
That answer helped change my attitude toward him. I could see the pain behind his eyes. Behind the appearance, there was a terrified person whose goodness was being claimed by the alcohol. He  was desperate for help, but not so sure that his condition could be changed.
I, thank this man for showing me that the goodness is dressed in all sorts of disguises  . Sometimes we have to undress it. It's worth doing. My patient was admitted to the hospital for help ,despite us not having a detox facility.",high6776.txt
