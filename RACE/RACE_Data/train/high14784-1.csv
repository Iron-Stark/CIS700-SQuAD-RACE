1,B,"['Several volcanoes broke out on Mars directly creating grand canyons.', 'Several great lakes existed on the upper parts of the Colorado River.', 'People built high dams on the upper parts of the Colorado River.', 'The Colorado River crossed the Grand Canyon to form down-cutting.']","According to the passage, which of the following statements is TURE?","How the Grand Canyon   was created remains one of the geology's greatest mysteries. Some evidence suggests that the process was a gradual one in which the Colorado River (which runs through the canyon) slowly cut deeper and deeper into the ground over millions of years. But volcanic rock samples taken from the canyon now suggest that the canyon was down-cut instead.
Down-cutting is when a flood of water rushes over a landscape   with enough force to cut deeply into the ground and leaves behind a canyon. Such a flood is usually released when a natural or man-made dam   bursts.
Robert Webb, a research geologist, says natural dams seem to have formed and broken across the Colorado River several times during the last million years. The dams were built when lava  from the eruptions of nearby volcanoes flowed into the river. The lava hardened into hard rocks and blocked the river, causing it to back up and form a lake. Each time the lake grew so huge that it broke the rock dam, releasing a flash flood that furthered the down-cutting process and deepened the canyon.
Down-cutting is not just an earthly event. Satellite photos sent back from Mars suggest that the process has happened there, too, say many other researchers.
The photos, taken by the Mars Global Surveyor, indicate that an enormous lake existed on Mars 3.5 billion years ago. The lake spilled into a large nearby hole. One edge of the hole broke, releasing a flash flood that quickly carved out a grand canyon.
The existence of down-cutting on Mars is just one more piece of evidence that the cold, dry planet was once warm and wet.",high14784.txt
