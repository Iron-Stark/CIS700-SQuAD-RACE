1,C,"['The united effort from the whole global village.', 'The good quality from the foreign volunteers.', 'The great care from the adults in his community.', 'The positive support from some of his family.']","According to the author, what plays an important part in the growth of Javier?","Last August, I traveled with a group of volunteers to Tres de Mayo, a small community near Tela, Honduras to help renovate   a community centre. During my stay there, I learned many things and I also had plenty of opportunity to interact   and work with local children, and I often could not help but think about the hardships they faced day to day, all factors considered to place children at-risk for problems later in life.
One young boy in particular, Javier, 16, stood out for me. Javier's father had left a year earlier for the U. S., and the family had not heard from him since. This put his mother in a difficult position, stay in Tres de Mayo with no job and no source of income. In the end she decided to move to another province to find work. Javier with his little brother had to stay to live with their grandfather in a small house. Many of the children we met in Tres de Mayo were in similar situations.
As our last day approached, I remember the look in Javier's eyes, as they welled up  with tears when we told him we were leaving. One of the volunteers held him close, but it did little to _ him. He had already experienced so much loss, his father abandoning him, his mother leaving to find work, and it was hard to realize that our departure  was adding to the list.
As I looked beyond Javier, I could see the many men and women whom Javier looked up to, depended on, and gathered strength from. I did know that without parents to raise him, he was not left alone. Instead, the adults in the community took responsibility for the care of their collective young.",high14101.txt
