3,D,"['An Old Go Player', 'A Strange Woman', 'A Boring Game', 'Winning or Playing']",What is the best title of the passage?,"Two people sit down to play Go . One of the players is an old man. He is now 89 years old. He has spent all of his life playing this game. The other person is a young woman. She has been playing Go for only three years. Before this, the woman was an expert at playing computer games. Now she plays Go the same way she played computer games---by becoming a machine herself.
They will play many games, until they know who the winner is. The woman shows no feelings but thinking about all the possible ways of placing her next stone. The old man, on the other hand, looks at the movements of her hands and of her face. This has always helped him to win.
He wins the first three games. She wins the next game, and the man is surprised. He has never lost to a woman. The old man worries about the way the young woman is playing the game. He can't read her face, he does not understand her way of playing.
""The way I think about the game"", says the woman, ""is that it is steps for getting what I want."" Again, the old man is surprised. For him, the game is a way of life itself, and not a model of life. ""There is no more beauty any longer. Everything is science and rules. Everything is about winning. Nothing is about playing,"" he says.
They cannot agree with each other, but it is not necessary. ""Change is a necessary part of life"", thinks the man. ""Playing is as important as winning"", thinks the woman.
They start to play their final game.",middle8163.txt
