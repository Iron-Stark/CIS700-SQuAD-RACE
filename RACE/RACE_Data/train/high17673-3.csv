3,D,"['asking a question', 'making small talk', 'greeting each other', 'talking about the game']","When we say ""Great game, isn't it ?"" what do we mean in fact?","As we all know , the language is a very important tool for people to communicate with each other. In most of the languages , people usually begin their conversations by a kind of small talk -a casual form of conversation that ""breaks the ice"" or fills an awkward silence between people . That is to say , small talk means the little things we talk about to start a conversation . In English-speaking countries such as Britain, people often make small talk about the weather. "" Nice day, isn't it?"" ""Terrible weather , isn't it?""
However, we still have something special about small talk. It must be about something which both people have the same opinion about. The purpose of small talk is to let both people agree on something. This makes meeting people easier and more comfortable . People usually agree about the weather, so it is a safe topic for small talk. But people often disagree about religion or politics so these are not suitable topics for small talk. The topics for small talk also depend on where the conversation is taking place. At basketball matches, people make small talk about the game they are watching. ""Great game , isn't it?"" At train stations, people may talk about the transport system . "" The train service is terrible, isn't it?""",high17673.txt
