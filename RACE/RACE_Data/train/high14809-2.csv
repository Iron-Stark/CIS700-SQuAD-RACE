2,A,"['You have little to write.', 'Writing journals is fun.', ""You're good at writing."", ""It's hard to keep track of articles.""]",What do you think about writing journals as a beginner?,"Writing journals has been one of the most helpful things I've ever done. Through writing journals I've not only learned a lot about myself, but also removed a lot of obsessive   thoughts, by writing them down and considering them.
Journals give you a place to write down your honest thoughts without being afraid of what people will think of you. There are some ideas for writing journals:
 Draw pictures
 Write poetry or short stories
 Goals: daily and long-term
 Respond to a magazine article that you are interested in
 Write about obsessive thoughts and try to find what's causing them
 A list of things you are proud of (It can always increase your confidence when you need it)
 Make a pro/con (/) list when you're trying to make a decision: most of the time the decision will start to be clearer afterwards
The best way to start is to decide where you want to write your journal. (Though it's called the journal, it doesn't mean you can only do it in a ""journal"") . If you like the traditional style of journals, then use a notebook, blank paper or graph paper, whichever you like best. If you prefer to go digital, start a blog. You can make the blog public or private, and it's a good way to keep track of articles or pictures you find online. (You can link to them.)
Even if you feel there's nothing for you to write about at first, you might be surprised to find that once you start, you can't stop.",high14809.txt
