2,C,"['Power of New Technology', 'Never Too Old to Learn', 'My Biggest Mistake Ever', 'Building a Business Partnership']",Which of the following can be the best title for this text?,"In 1992, I had just launched a new business called Video News International.
It was the world's first video journalist network. The idea was to cover news and sell the service to news organizations.
One day, a young intern   who was working for us named Anthony Lappe pulled me aside.
""There is something you have to see,"" he told me. ""Comcast is doing this really cool thing.""
""What?""
""The Internet,"" he said. ""It's going to be really big.""
Anthony later introduced me to the head of the Internet project.
""We are looking for content to put on our network here,"" the guy said to me.
Well, I said I had lots of content to offer.
The guy's eyes lit up. ""Cool,"" he said. ""We would like to put it on our network.""
Well, I was always looking for new clients.
""What are you going to pay?"" I asked.
He said that they could not pay anything for the content, but they would set up a URL for me.
""What's that?"" I asked.
""It's kind of like your address on the web.""
""What would I do with this URL thing?""
""Well, it could be your business.""
""I don't see how it is a business, and there's not even any advertising,"" I cleverly replied.
""Not yet,"" he said. ""But one day there might be.""
I thought about it for two seconds.
""Naah..."" I said. "" _ . I've got to be going now. Maybe we can cooperate next time.""
And I walked out.
Idiot!
Well, that Internet thing turned out to be so much bigger than I had thought. I wish I had never made such a mistake. Sorry Anthony. You were right.",high9944.txt
