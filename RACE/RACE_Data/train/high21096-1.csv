1,C,"['Effects of Smoking', 'Smoking is Harmful', ""Mothers, Don't Smoke"", 'Lung Cancer']",Which of the following is the best title of the passage?,"American doctors say that mothers who smoke cigarettes before their babies are born may slow the growth of their babies' lungs. They say reduced lung growth could cause the babies to suffer breathing problems and lung diseases later in life. Doctors in Boston, Massachusetts studied 1,000 children. The mothers of some of the children smoked, while the other mothers did not. Doctors found that the lungs of the children whose mothers smoked were 8% less developed than the lungs of the children whose mothers did not smoke, and that the children whose mothers smoked had 25% more cold and breathing diseases than other children later in life.
Another recent study found that children had a greater chance of having lung cancer if their mothers smoked. The study also showed that the danger of cancer increased only for sons and not for daughters, and that the father's smoking did not affect a child's chance of suffering from lung cancer.",high21096.txt
