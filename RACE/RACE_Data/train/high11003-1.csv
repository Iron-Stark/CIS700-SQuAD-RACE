1,C,"['Avoiding taking alcohol and medicine.', 'Not getting out of bed immediately.', 'Drinking a cup of hot milk.', 'Writing down as many details as possible.']",Which of the following ways may NOT be useful for recalling dreams?,"Remembering your dreams will require some efforts on your part. But what your dreams can offer and tell you about yourself will be well worth _ Here are some tips to help recall your dreams:
1. Before going to bed, keep a clear mind. Tell yourself that ""I will remember my dreams when I wake up"". This is actually a proven and effective way to recall your dreams.
2. Have a regular bedtime and wake-up time. Make this your routine. Going to bed and waking up at a regular time every day could aid in dream recollection.
3. Avoid alcohol consumption and taking medicine before going to bed. These things may prevent you from remembering your dreams.
4. Keep a pencil and a notebook next to your bed so that they will be within reach as soon as you wake up. Having a small lamp by your bedside is also a good idea, so you wake up in the middle of the night and can record your dreams immediately.
5. Do not get out of bed immediately. Upon waking from a dream, lie still in your bed, keeping your eyes closed and moving as little as possible. Let your mind wander among the images of what you have just dreamed.
6. Write down as many details in your dreams as you can, no matter how seemingly unimportant they may be. Do not judge the content or worry if they make sense.
7. Sometimes it may help to draw pictures. A picture is worth a thousand words, as the saying goes. Even if you are not an artist, a simple drawing can help to recall details of your dreams.",high11003.txt
