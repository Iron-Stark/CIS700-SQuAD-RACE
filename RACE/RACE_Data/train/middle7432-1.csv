1,C,"['60%', '30%', '10%', '20%']",How many people think each one should celebrate Christmas Day?,"What do you think of celebrating Christmas Day in China? Christmas Day is very popular in China, especially for young people. Should Chinese people celebrate Christmas Day? 60% people think that we should not take Christmas so seriously, 10% think everyone should celebrate Christmas.
Some people think celebrating Christmas Day can help them understand western culture better. Some people think it is a great holiday to have a good time with their families and friends. During Christmas Day, they can meet friends, go shopping, watch movies and go to different parties.
But I have different ideas. Most of us celebrate Christmas just because we see many people around us do it.
China has its own holidays, such as the Spring Festival and Mid-Autumn Day, so we don't have to celebrate holidays from other countries. Some people spend a lot of money celebrating Christmas Day. People buy lots of gifts for their friends and families, but this is not the best way to show their love.",middle7432.txt
