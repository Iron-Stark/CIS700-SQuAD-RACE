0,A,"['a shock to online booksellers', 'curiosity to the Swedish Academy', 'contrary to the belief of the Chinese media', 'beyond the expectation of most Chinese people']",From this passage we know that the news of Mo Yan's Nobel Prize in Literature was_.,"The breaking news of Mo Yan's Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday evening soon aroused public curiosity of the 57-year-old Chinese writer: Why was he favored by the Swedish Academy?
    Less than half an hour after the announcement from Stockholm,  Mo's works turned to ""sold out"" status at China's major online book sellers.
    One lucky buyer wrote in an online comment: ""Rushed to purchase, but to my shame, I have not read any of his novels.""
    Although Mo was entitled one of the top China's literature awards before the Nobel Prize, he is not the most popular novelist in China, in either the book market or in reputation.
    Chinese media seemed to be shocked as some journalists were reported to be on their way overnight to Gaomi City of East China's Shandong Province, Mo's birthplace where he stayed with his family.
    Born in 1955 into a rural family, Mo dropped out of school and became a farmer when he was a teenager. He joined the army and devoted himself to writing. Mo's novels were translated into several languages.
    For more than a century, Nobel Prize has been regarded by the world as recognition to an individual or even a nation's cultural and scientific advances.
    ""I think the reason why I could win the prize is that my works present lives with unique Chinese characteristics, and they also tell stones from a viewpoint of common human beings, which transcends differences of nations and races,"" Mo said on Thursday evening to Chinese journalists.
    Mo also said many folk arts originated from his hometown, such as paper cuts and traditional new year paintings, have inspired and influenced his novels.
    Mo's prize may give powerful encouragement to the country's writers as the more reflective of Chinese lives their works are, the more possible they arise as world literature.",high18264.txt
