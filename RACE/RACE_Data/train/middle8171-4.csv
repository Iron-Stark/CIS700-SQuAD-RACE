Are you looking for a place where you can enjoy Chinese study and experience Chinese culture during the summer holiday? Hua Mandarin could be your wise choice.
The new summer camp will start on July 28th and end on August 18th. We provide very small groups with 2-4 people for you to learn Chinese in an effective way. Activities including calligraphy  , painting, culture show, Chinese movies, kung fu, swimming, and so on will help you walk into Chinese culture with fun.
Welcome to call at 62197830  *  Kitty for more details.

The earlier camp finished last week. Students are happy here, although they have to learn a lot upon parents' request  . Teachers here are trying to help children to learn in a funny way.
