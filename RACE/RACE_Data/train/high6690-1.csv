Don't worry--relax! Remember these things and you'll be fine.
Be on time. Find out exactly where the interview is and how to get there. Remember that buses and trains can often be late so allow plenty of time. It's better to be early than late.
Be prepared. Think about what the interviewer will ask you. He or she will probably ask about your qualifications   and your experience but they'll also ask you why you want the job. Think of some possible questions and prepare your answers before you go.
Wear comfortable clothes. If you wear something new it will make you feel uncomfortable. It's best to wear something smart but something you like and feel happy in.
