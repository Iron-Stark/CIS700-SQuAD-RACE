Now researchers have found that people with musical training have an easier time learning Chinese.Writing in the online edition of Nature Nenroscieme, researchers from Northwestern University say that both skills draw on the same parts of the brain that help people discover changes in pitch  .
One of the study's authors, Nina Kraus, said the findings suggested that studying music ""actually tunes our sensory system"".This means that schools that want children to do well in languages should hesitate before cutting music programs.Dr.Kraus said.She said music training might also help children with language problems.

As they were shown a movie, the volunteers also heard an audio tape of the Mandarin word ""mi"" in three of its meanings: squint, bewilder and rice.The researchers recorded activities in their brain stems to see how well they were processing the sounds.Those with a music background showed much more brain activities in response to the Chinese sounds.
The lead author of the study, Patrick C.M.Wong, said it might work both ways.It appear? That native speakers of tonal languages may do better at learning instruments.",high20866.txt
