1,C,"['Weather conditions.', 'Road conditions.', ""People's safety."", ""People's convenience.""]","According to Mr Strachan, what is the first consideration while providing public transport?","TransLink is urging customers to avoid non-essential travel today and to stay home where possible in the difficult weather conditions.
TransLink chief executive officer Peter Strachan said bus and train services were continuing to run where possible, however all CityCat and CityFerry services had been cancelled until further notice.
""These are extremely difficult conditions for South East Queensland---we are running essential services where possible but safety remains to be the most important,"" Mr Strachan said.
""Severe weather and associated flooding has impacted on all modes of public transport, with bus, ferry and train services all impacted to varying degrees.
""If you are planning to use public transport at anytime over the next few days, then I would recommend you check that your intended service is still running.""
Service disruptions   for today include:
l City network trains running hourly on all lines.
l Bus diversions, delays and cancellations in some regions, particularly across Brisbane, Ipswich and the Sunshine Coast.
l CityCat and CityFerry services cancelled.
Queensland Rail Chief Executive Officer Paul Scurrah said rising waterways had closed some train lines, and road closures and damage to property throughout the South-East had contributed to a shortage of available rail employees.
""We intend to run trains hourly on all lines, similar to the timetable we operate on Christmas Day. We will also be looking to run other additional services to meet demand as required. At this stage we will run services stopping at all stations which will depart at the same time on the hour, however, this is all subject to the weather conditions and the availability of traincrew.""
Mr Scurrah encouraged all customers to visit the Translink website for specific departure times for their station, and asked for patience in the event of delays.
""Queensland Rail appreciates that reduced services may cause disruptions but it is simply unavoidable. We have a dedicated and experienced team monitoring the situation around the clock and will be working to reopen the network as soon as practicably possible,"" Mr Scurrah said.
