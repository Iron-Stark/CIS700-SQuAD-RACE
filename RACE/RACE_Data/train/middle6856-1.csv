She is an English child singer from Streetly, West Midlands. She is best known for being on ""Britain's Got Talent""(<<>> )when she was just six. She has been singing since she was 19 months old. The song she is most known for is Somewhere over the Rainbow. And now she is touring the country with the UK's biggest children's choir--Young Voices.
Do you know what the Young Voices Tour is? Well, it's a great event for children. It is great for them to sing on a big stage with thousands of other children. Everyone waits for the parents to arrive in the evening to watch the children put on a great show. There is so much fun. When the lights turn on, everyone sings together at the same time as one. It's so loud and powerful . Connie loves looking around at the choir and seeing everyone so happy when she was performing.
""We've heard you got a new Guinness world record!"" I asked her. ""Yes! I am very proud. It was amazing to get the Guinness world record for the biggest choir at the back of a singer. I am glad to share that world record with more than 6000 other children present that day,"" she answered.",middle6856.txt
