3,B,"[""D' Zhana Simmons had only one heart transplant."", ""The doctors used two machines to keep D' Zhana Simmons' life."", ""D' Zhana Simmons was the first person to live with a man-made heart."", ""The doctors wasted some time when they looked for a heart for D' Zhana Simmons.""]",Which of the following is true according to the passage?,"It was a great day for American girl D' Zhana Simmons when she got a new heart. However, her dream died when the new heart started not to work properly. The doctors had to take it away. She needed another heart transplant  . But the doctors couldn't find a proper heart so soon. Then they came up with an idea -- they would use two machines to keep her blood _ in her body. After waiting for about four months, D' Zhana had another heart transplant. It was very successful.
When doctors use a man-made heart to keep a patient's life, they usually leave the patient's own heart in the body. ""She, we believe, is possibly one of the youngest that had the machines without her own heart,"" one of D' Zhana Simmons' doctors said.
Living without a heart for 118 days -- that's great. When a heart transplant doesn't work, doctors have no time to waste. If they don't get a new heart or some machines to help the patient, he or she will die. The patient's life is in their hands. This story once again shows how important the medical   world really can be. I hope that one day I will be a doctor. I hope I can be so quick and helpful to my patients.",middle4606.txt
