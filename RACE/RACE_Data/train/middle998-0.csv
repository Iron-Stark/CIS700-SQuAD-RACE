0,C,"['Everyday', 'Twiceaday', 'Twiceaweek.', 'Twiceamonth.']",How often do most boys play basketball?,"There are 45 students in our class. I have made a survey, 36 students say they like to exercise. Most boys play basketball together twice a week. But girls think basketball is difficult for them, they'd like to play volleyball together twice a week. My friend, Tony, is good at running. He runs fastest in our class. He runs for 30 minutes on the playground every evening before he goes to bed. Is it interesting? Gray is good at swimming. He goes to the swimming club three times a month in winter, and three times a week in summer. So he is pretty healthy. Some of my classmates have good eating habits. They eat both meat and vegetables. 70% of them drink milk every day. 15 students say they drink milk three or four times a week. But some students like to eat junk food, especially Sally. What's worse is that she doesn't like to exercise, so she is very fat. She always says "" I'm going to lose weight  tomorrow.""",middle998.txt
