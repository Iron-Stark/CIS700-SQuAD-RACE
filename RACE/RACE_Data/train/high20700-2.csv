2,C,"['Venus is always the last to appear in the sky in the evening', 'Venus is sometimes the last to appear in the sky in the morning.', 'The diameter of the earth is nearly eight thousand miles.', 'Venus is sometimes the last to disappear in the western sky in the morning.']",The passage shows that   _  .,"Venus is known as the Earth' ""twin"" because the planets are so like each other in size. The diameter   of Venus is about 7,520 miles (12,100km), about 400 miles (644km) smaller than that of the earth. No other planet comes closer to the earth than Venus. At its nearest approach it is about 25,000,000 miles (402,000,000km) away.
As seen from the earth, Venus is the first planet or star that can be seen in the western sky in the evening. At other times, it is the last planet or star that can be seen in the eastern sky in the morning. When Venus is near its brightest point, it can be seen in the daylight. Early astronomers called the object that appeared in the evening Hesperus, and Phosphorus in the morning. Later they realized these two objects were the same planet. They named it Venus in honor of the Roman goddess of love and beauty.",high20700.txt
