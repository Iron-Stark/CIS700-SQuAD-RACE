2,C,"['Modern', 'Competitive', 'Peaceful', 'Splendid']",Which word can be used to describe the Harvard campus?,"Recently I paid a visit to Harvard University, where there are top class scientists and professors and the best academic system in the world.
I was pretty shocked when I first stepped onto the campus. Well, it's not even really a campus. It's more like a district in a small town.
Harvard's main buildings are from the 18thcentury. They look very old and simple. You might even say they're a little shabby. They don't fit the modern idea of university at all. The buildings are surrounded by grass and trees, so I felt as if I had walked into a medieval castle. But when I looked across the street, busy shops and in-fashion students made me feel like I was in the 21stcentury again. It creates a strong contrast  and brings a special atmosphere to the school.
Our tour guide Gary took us around and told us, ""You see this grass field in the center of the school? Here is where they host their graduation ceremony. They just set up tents and benches and have a very simple ceremony. Unbelievable! Who would think the most talented students just graduate on the lawn?""
I saw some students put a blanket on the grass and lie down to read a book. When I listened to the soft sound of pages turning, along with the chirping  of the birds, I felt very calm. There was no competitive feeling at all.
Harvard has the world's first computer in its science center and there are hundreds of high-end computers too. Its religion and the literature departments are also among the best. It is the perfect mix of tradition and new technology. It makes Harvard a very attractive place to study in.
I hope one day I'll attend my dream school---Harvard.",high12354.txt
