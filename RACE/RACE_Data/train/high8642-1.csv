Why did they want to create a""lifestyle""magazine for the disabled people?The pair,both in their 20s,say they wanted to produce something""positive and inspiring""that would tell about  the lives of disabled people as they actually were.They were especially eager to produce something that showed young disabled people""what it was possible to do with their lives"",says  Sibley.
In less than a year,Disability Horizons has had more than 50 regular contributors and  attracted a reader base of more than 20,000 people,more than a third of whom are in the US.
Sibley and Madipalli have a genetic disease that causes progressive muscle wasting and loss of movement.They are wheelchair users and have been good friends since growing up in  London and Cambridge.Listening to them joke,it makes perfect sense that their shared  optimistic outlook has spilled over into the magazine.The site covers topics ranging from books and travel to clubbing and photography.""It's definitely a mix.""Madipalli says.",high8642.txt
