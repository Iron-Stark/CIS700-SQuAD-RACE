fade, even under the most difficult situations. Following are some favorite Lincoln stories. All
are fun to read.
Abe Needs His Hair Combed
    President Lincoln had the ability to laugh at himself and he greatly enjoyed telling stories in
which he was the object of the joke. He especially liked this one: when I was nominated at
Chicago, I had never before sat for a photograph. One fellow thought that many people might
like to see what I looked like, so he immediately bought the camera and began selling
photographs of me all over the country. I happened to be in Springfield when I heard a boy
selling them on the streets. ""Here's your likeness of ""Abe"" Lincoln!"",he shouted to Lincoln.
""Only two shillifigs!He'll look a lot better once he gets his hair combed!""
Nobody Ever Died in Here!
    A man was complaining to the President that a friend of his had been driven away from
New Orleans because he was a Union supporter. When the man asked to see the paper by which
he was driven away, he was simply told that the Confederate Government would do nothing
illegal, and so they had issued no papers. They were simply hoping to make him go on his own
free will. Naturally, that reminded Lincoln of a story, and he remarked that he had known of a
hotel keeper in St. Louis who boasted that nobody ever died in his hotel. ""Of course,""
Lincoln said with a twinkle in his eye, ""anytime a guest appeared to be in danger of dying he
was carried out to die outside.""
Let the Elephant Run
    Assistant Secretary of War Charles A. Dana had learned that a man named Jacob Thompson,
who had been causing the government many problems, was about to escape to Liverpool. Dana
approached Lincoln with the news. Lincoln asked Dana what Secretary of War Edwin Stanton
thought about it. Dana answered, ""He thinks we should arrest him.""
    Lincoln replied, ""I disagree. If you have an elephant on your hands that wants to run away,
you'd better let him run.""",high21123.txt
