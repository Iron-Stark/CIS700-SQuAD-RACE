1,D,"['Chinese writers have been writing more and more books in English', 'the Chinese language has become the most widely used language in the world', 'the Chinese government attaches great importance to literature', 'the cultural communication between China and western countries has developed']",Chinese literature has been attracting growing attention mainly because,"Chinese writer Mo Yan's Nobel Prize for Literature might _ an explosion of global interest in Chinese literature and lead to more titles translated into English, European experts say.
""Hopefully, the award means more people will read Chinese literature and more works will get translated,"" says Michel Hockx, professor of the Languages and Cultures of China and Inner Asia from University of London. ""Many very good Chinese writers have been accepted globally for a long time already. Mo Yan is probably the most translated Chinese writer alive, with at least five of his novels made available in English over the past 20 years.""
Jonathan Ruppin, web editor of bookseller Foyles, says Mo's win coincides with growing interest in Chinese literature and recognizes the talents of a distinctive and visionary writer. ""We are very excited by the fact that English translations of more of his books should now become available,"" Ruppin says. He made the comment after Mo became the first Chinese citizen to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in its century-long history.
As East-West cultural exchange has been booming, Chinese literature has been attracting growing attention in recent years. Hockx explains, ""It's mainly because there are many more opportunities for Chinese writers to visit other countries, to publish their works outside China and to interact with readers abroad. At the same time, more and more people globally are learning Chinese and taking an interest in the Chinese language and culture.""
University of Oxford lecturer in modern Chinese literature Margaret Hillenbrand says, ""The obvious reason for the growing global presence of Chinese literature is the growing global presence of China itself. People have come to realize that there is a serious knowledge deficit between China and its international counterparts -- in particular, _ -- and reading Chinese literature is an effective, simple means of solving that gap.""",high2694.txt
