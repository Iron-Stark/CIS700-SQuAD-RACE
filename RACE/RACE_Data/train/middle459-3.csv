3,A,"['wolf and his shadow', 'A wolf and a lion', 'The king of the forest', 'A strong wolf']",. Which one is the best title for this passage?,"When it was getting dark, a wolf was walking along the road. Then he was surprised to see his huge shadow  under his feet.
""Wow, I didn't know I was so big!"" The wolf was happy to know it.
As time went by, the sun was going down and his shadow grew bigger and bigger, so it looked like a giant.
""Oh, look at my shadow. I'm so big!"" The wolf thought that he was as big as his shadow. ""I'm huge and excellent. I don't need to be afraid of the lion.""
From then the wolf walked with his shoulders open. He thought of himself as the king of the forest.
""Why should I fear the lion? Lion! Come out! Here is your match .""It made the lion very angry, so he went to see the wolf.
""Here I am. I heard you said you could beat me. Now I'm here. Why don't you prove it?""
The lion's sharp claw  hit the wolf's head hard. The wolf was knocked out. ""Ah, help me!""
But it was too late when the wolf got to know that he wasn't as big or strong as his shadow. Unluckily, he became the lion's delicious supper.",middle459.txt
