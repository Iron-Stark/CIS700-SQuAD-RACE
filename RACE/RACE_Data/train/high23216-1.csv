John came back from Europe and immediately called Charlie and asked him to meet him at the house.When they met,John asked him if he had used the finest materials and spared no expense.Charlie said  ly.John said that he was glad.He paid Charlie,then told him that he knew he was not rich and had always struggled.So he wanted to reward Charlie for all of his years of service to the community by giving Charlie this house.
