0,C,"['At ten.', 'At ten to nine.', 'At ten past nine.', 'At thirty past nine.']",When was it that Selena arrived at the lowkey coffee shop?,"Selena Gomez and I are scheduled to meet at a lowkey coffee shop in Encino. Not wanting to keep the superstar waiting, I arrived at nine, 20 minutes early. As I was catching up on emails, Selena quietly scooted into the seat next to me. No bodyguard. Not even a drop of makeup. She was ten minutes early and no one else in the restaurant looked up so much. Selena was wearing Bebe shorts. She had a baby face and ordered a hot chocolate.
After making small talk about what she wore for the shoot, she dived into the subject of her career. Selena declared 2012 the year of movies. She filmed three: Spring Breakers, a drama; The Getaway, an action flick; and Hotel Transylvania, a comedy. Each is a marked move away from the teen style that made her a household name.
Now that her Disney days are behind her, Selena is at that unstable point in a child star's career where she is trying to grow up--both as a person(she turned 20 in July)and as an artist. ""Being part of the Disney Channel was such a blessing, and I'm super happy with what my show accomplished, but acting is something I would like to take on more seriously."" She continued, ""I don't necessarily feel accomplished. I want to create a whole different person when it comes to acting.""
Selena has been working fulltime since she was seven years old and scored a role on Barney&Friends. In 2007, when she was offered the lead in Wizards of Waverly Place, Selena, her mother, and her stepfather _ from Texas to LA , where they are settling now.",high12786.txt
