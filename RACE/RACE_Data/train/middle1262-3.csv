There are 42 classes, 110 teachers and 2400 students in the school.
In the middle of the school there is two tall buildings. They are for us to have classes. All the classrooms are there. There are some small rooms, too. They are offices for the teachers to work. All the teachers get ready for their lessons there.
In front of the tall buildings, there is a small one. It is the library. There are many books there. The teachers and the students like to read books in it. Sometimes they borrow  books from it.
There is a sports hall behind the tall buildings. The boys often play basketball there happily. Of course, there is a science building in my school.
This is my school. It's not only big, but also nice. I like my new school very much.",middle1262.txt
