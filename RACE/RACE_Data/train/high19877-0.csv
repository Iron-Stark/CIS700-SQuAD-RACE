0,C,"['Mel Robbins.', 'Kat Kinsman.', 'Andre Spicer.', 'Cicely Simpson.']",Who considers giving waiters tips as an embarrassment?,"Recently, Danny Meyer, founder of the Shake Shack chain, announced that his restaurants will do away with tipping. He plans to pay his staff higher wages and pass the cost to customers by raising prices on menus. Is this a good idea?
I'm sure Meyer's latest move will be a winner. The new model could work in Meyer's restaurants because he draws a particular type of customers who are there for a high-end experience. Besides, if the restaurants charge more for meals, they'll pay higher in taxes. As restaurants move to higher wages, the benefit costs will be higher, too.

For a European, eating in an American restaurant is like attending a high school reunion. Tipping turns the whole process into a drawn-out experience where money is at the center stage. There are so many opportunities for embarrassment. So I think Danny Meyer's proposal will change it for the better.
--Andre Spicer
Danny Meyer is doing the right thing by stopping tipping. Eating out costs what it costs and workers are hard-working humans who deserve the stability of a wage. It may take a while to catch on, but we'll get there and it'll become the norm.
--Kat Kinsman
I've found that the practice of tipping has traditionally attracted millions of employees to our industry. The current tipping model still has strong support from diners and they are more than happy to reward good service. But it is vital that restaurants continue to have the freedom to choose what works best for their business and their employees.
