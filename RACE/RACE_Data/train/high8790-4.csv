4,D,"['The husband should save the wife', 'Human beings can beat crocodiles sometimes', 'A crocodile is not so dangerous as people imagine', ""A man saves wife's life from crocodile's jaws""]",Which of the following would be the best title for this passage?,"Norm Pethrick, a 36-year-old man in Australia's northern city Darwin, was praised on Thursday for jumping onto a crocodile's back to save his wife Wendy at Litchfield National Park, a popular tourist spot southwest of Darwin, a local newspaper reported.
Ms Pethrick was standing on a river bank Wednesday afternoon when the saltwater crocodile lunged  , locking its jaws on both her legs as it tried to drag her underwater.
Norm Pethrick, who with his wife had been collecting water, immediately went to help her. He jumped onto the back, poked   the eyes of the crocodile and finally got his wife free.
Ms Pethrick was later taken to Royal Darwin Hospital for a medical treatment. The doctors said she was suffering eight puncture wounds in her right leg, a puncture wound in her left leg and a serious cut to one of her fingers.
""This could have been a fatal and tragic situation,"" said the general manager of Royal Darwin Hospital (RDH), Dr Len Notaras, according to a local report.
He said Ms Pethrick was saved by her husband's ""quick and diligent actions"". Dr Notaras also said she would remain in hospital for three to four days and have an operation to clean the wounds, which are easy to get infected because of bacteria on the teeth of the crocodile.",high8790.txt
