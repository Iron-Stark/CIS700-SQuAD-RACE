2,C,"['how Megan helps people give up smoking', ""a little girl's dream to be a world-famous inventor"", ""a 10-year-old inventor's story"", ""Megan's relationship with her family members""]",The passage is mainly about_.,"Paula and Rory have fives kids, three dogs, and a rabbit. When the house is very noisy, Megan, one of the children, is quietly inventing. A year ago, the 10-year-old had to design an anti-smoking poster, she came up with the idea of creating something that shows the average amount of tar  a smoker collects from just four packs of cigarettes.
""I like people to play with things more than read and write,"" she says. So she researched her idea on the Internet, found a company in China that could make it, saved up her pocket money and got her idea made.
Paula says her daughter ""think differently"": Ideas jump into her mind. After she got sunburnt on holiday, Megan invented a small plastic bracelet  that changes colors in the sun, telling you when to put on sunscreen . Several sunscreen companies have expressed an interest in the idea. She also came up with an idea to make a ball filled with water to stop the dog from feeling thirsty. ""But we didn't do anything with it,"" says Paula.
Then she pulls out a picture of a special fishing rod  she had designed. ""There is a camera on the hook ,"" she explains, ""and the screen is on the handle, and it shows if you've caught a fish or not.""
Megan doesn't want to go to university. She keeps her pink-and -cream bedroom tidy. Paula is amazed and a bit confused by her daughter. ""Everything has to be in a certain order,"" Paula says. ""Her brothers and sisters go with the flow, but with Megan, it's 'What time will that be happening?' or 'Where am I being picked up from today?'""",high15365.txt
