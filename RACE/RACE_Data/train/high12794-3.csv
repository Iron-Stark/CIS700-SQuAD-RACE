3,A,"['Optimistic and warm-hearted.', 'Honest and responsible.', 'Unusual and confident.', 'Friendly and brave.']",Which of the following can best describe Sam Allred?,"Sam Allred suffers from a rare and incurable kidney   disease. One day, when his sister was playing a song repeatedly, Sam sang along. His sister thought it was funny so she recorded it and posted the video online. The video -- and Sam -- became a hit. Only 8 years old at the time, he couldn't have expected the response.
""(The television show) The Doctors called and wanted me on their show so they paid for me to go to California,"" says Sam, now 13, ""and we got to stay in a hotel where all the movie stars stayed.""
During that visit to California, Angie Allred, Sam's mother, had an idea about Sam writing a children's book. Together, she and Sam wrote Opening Hearts, which tells Sam's experience of living with a chronic   illness.
""I wrote the book to teach people to be kinder to people,"" Sam says.
Moreover, Sam wanted to send pillows to sick children staying in hospitals around the country to make their stay more comfortable, an idea that came from a time when he was in the hospital.
""A few kind boys came in with pillows and they gave me one and it meant a lot to me that someone cared about kids in the hospital,"" says Sam.
Angie thought of starting a nonprofit organization to provide a way for people to contribute money to realize Sam's ideas. She named the nonprofit Kindness for Kids.
Since then, Sam has taken pillows to children staying at Providence Hospital in Anchorage.
Sam's father, Scott Allred, owns a small business that contracts   shipping services with FedEx Ground. He asked the company for help.
""FedEx Ground learned about Sam's pillow project,"" says Erin Truxal, manager of public relations for FedEx Ground. ""We thought, 'What a perfect way for us to get involved.'""
The company provided shipping services for Sam to ship about 5,000 pillows to hospitals.
Sam wants to send more pillows to all of the children's hospitals in every state. His goal is simple: ""Kids in the hospital as happy as they were before they got sick,"" he says.",high12794.txt
