3,C,"['Computers can help people with their choice of words.', 'Spell checks can take the place of spelling teaching.', ""Handwriting still has a place in today's classrooms."", 'Functional spelling ability develops fast in the fifth grade.']",What conclusion could be drawn from the passage?,"The practice of students endlessly copying letters and sentences from a blackboard is a thing of the past. With the coming of new technologies like computers and smartphone, writing by hand has become something of nostalgic  skill. However, while today's educators are using more and more technology in their teaching, many believe basic handwriting skills are still necessary for students to be successful---both in school and in life.
Virginia Berninger, professor of educational psychology at the University of Washington, says it's important to continue teaching handwriting and help children acquire the skill of writing by hand.
Berninger and her colleagues conducted a study that looked at the ability of students to complete various writing tasks---both on a computer and by hand. The study, published in 2009, found that when writing with a pen and paper, participants wrote longer essays and more complete sentences and had a faster word production rate.
In a more recent study, Berninger looked at what role spelling plays in a student's writing skills and found that how well children spell is tied to know well they can write. ""Spelling makes some of the thinking parts of the brain active which helps us access our vocabulary, word meaning and concepts. It is allowing our written language to connect with ideas."" Berninger said.
Spelling helps students translate ideas into words in their mind first and then to transcribe  ""those words in the mind written symbols on paper or keyboard and screen,"" the study said. Seeing the words in the ""mind's eye"" helps children not only to turn their ideas into words, says Berninger, but also to spot  spelling mistakes when they write the words down and to correct then over time.
""In our computer age, some people believe that we don't have to teach spelling because we have spell checks,"" she said. ""But until a child has a functional spelling ability of about a fifth grade level, they won't have the knowledge to choose the correct spelling among the options given by the computer.""",high459.txt
