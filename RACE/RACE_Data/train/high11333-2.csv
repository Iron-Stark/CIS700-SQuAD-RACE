2,A,"['real', 'not real', 'creative', 'imaginative']","From the text,we can see the writer believes his experiences are  _","Back in 2003 I had a pet rabbit named Alaska.Due to the rules the landlord had set,he had to be kept in the basement .One night I went downstairs to feed him.Keep in mind I've always thought the basement was frightening.As I was facing his cage and putting the bowl of water inside,a big shadow appeared behind me,as if a big,tall man were standing behind me.I turned around and nobody was there,but I got the distinct feeling that I was being watched.I basically dropped the water bowl and ran upstairs shouting for my mom.Ever since then I can't go down there alone.
Once I was trying to get to sleep,and I slept with the lights off.All of sudden I wanted to leave the room eagerly,but I couldn't get out of my bed,I was too scared.The feeling of someone looking closely at me was so upset,I was physically afraid to move or breathe.I opened my curtains to let the street light in,thinking the light would help me feel better to move.That did nothing.I must have sat there on my bed for about fifteen minutes before I got up.I didn't sleep in there that night.I've never felt anything so upset!
Then there are all the little things,like seeing things in the comer of my eye,hearing doors open or close when I'm home alone,and the feeling of being watched.Once when my sister wasn't home(we share a room)I heard someone breathing from her bed and heard the sheets rustle .Last week,I felt someone patting me in the shoulder when I was alone in my room.Sometimes I'll be looking something and I'll see one or more contorted ,angry faces.
I realize that when one is looking for something to happen they can make things happen or imagine it.These are the moments in which I know nothing was imagined,so I wanted to share them and get your opinions.Thanks so much.",high11333.txt
