In some ways,the relaxed attitude was shocking,says Melville.But it was a sign of how students' understanding of their role has changed. ""They have a more independent view of the university,and they feel free to comment,""said Melville.
A committee,led by Melville,was set up earlier this year to explore the change in students' attitudes towards teachers.
 ""This is something being driven by young people,""said Melville. ""They live surrounded by different kinds of electronic resources.They use social networking tools and things like Wikipedia.The first group of these students is now at university.""
Students don't regard teaching staff in the same way as previous students did. ""Because Web2.0,  Google,Wikipedia are all about being able to change things yourself,students expect to be able to do this as well,""said Melville.
There have been other changes in the student--teacher relationship.If students choose to study through a social networking group,they are in control.They don't always make staff welcome,and they are free to decide which staff members they allow in.
""Almost everybody who gets into using these kinds of technologies,it appears,becomes much shallower in their research,""said Melville.",high22231.txt
