""I can think of nobody who is more qualified than Gary Locke."" President Obama said. Locke's new position is clearly a sign that US President is trying to improve relations with China.
When he made his first speech to the Chinese press in Beijing, Locke said, "" I think, being a Chinese-American, I have a greater understanding of the US government.""
Before becoming ambassador to China, Locke was US secretary of commerce  . This means he has plenty of trade experience, which will be useful in building economic links between the two countries.

""I'm going back to the birthplace of my grandfather, my father and my mom, and I'll be doing so as a devoted diplomat   for America, the country where I was born and raised,"" Locke said.
