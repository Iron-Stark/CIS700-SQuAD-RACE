2,C,"['Two', 'Three', 'Four', 'Five']",How many skills are there in the text for people to lose weight?,"This is not a diet. It's a simple way to lose weight. You don't have to give up the food you love or join a gym. You just follow some habits thin people have. Keep them, and you'll become thin.
*Wake-up  When you wake up in the morning, sit up slowly without using your hands. With legs straight out, lean forward  until you feel sore  in your back. It will use up 10 calories.
*Start with soup  Order a clear soup, and have it before the main food. In this way, you'll feel fuller, so you'll eat less when the main food comes.
*An apple or more a day  Apples are full of fiber  and water, so your stomach will want less. Studies show that people who eat at least three apples or pears a day may lose weight.
*Talk it up  Every time you use the cell phone, stand up and walk around. Heavy people sit on average two and a half hours more each day than thin people. This skill is very important and standing up and walking around will burn up 50 or more calories.
Use these skills, and you will have a big weight loss.",high8801.txt
