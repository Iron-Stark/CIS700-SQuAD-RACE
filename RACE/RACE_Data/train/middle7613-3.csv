3,B,"['Talkative and careless.', 'Warm and thoughtful.', 'Knowledgeable and proud.', 'Shy and friendly.']",What kind of person is Kelly?,"WHEN a woman took the seat beside me on a plane, I felt uncomfortable. She had to lower herself slowly, squeezing   her body into the small space.
""My name is Kelly. I'm from Canada. Where are you from?"" She waved a hand in front of my face. ""China,"" I said as I shook her hand unhappily.
Kelly kept talking to me. She was very thoughtful. When we were served drinks and meals, she made sure that I had enough room in my seat.
""I don't want to make you uncomfortable with my elephant size!"" she said sincerely. I couldn't help but let down my guard.
As we talked, I was surprised by her wise words. She had read many books and was very smart.
I asked her if she ever thought about losing some weight.
""Aren't you worried about the diseases that come with being overweight?""
""Not at all. I eat healthy and walk regularly,"" she said. ""I believe in my heart, the people who get diseases are the ones who worry. You see advertisements from exercise centers that read, 'Free yourself from your extra baggage, so you are free to be yourself.' You're free only if you're comfortable with who you are!""
I suddenly realized that Kelly was the most beautiful and clever woman I had ever met in my life.",middle7613.txt
