0,D,"['his / her ears are red', 'his / her ears will not change all the life', 'he / she will get large ears', 'his / her ears will not change in shape']","When a baby is born,   _  .","The size and shape  of your ears show your character more than any other parts of the face. Other parts of the face change shape as we get older, but ears do not change their shape. They only change in size.
Reading people's character from their ears is an old science. In very old times people thought that a person with big ears had a good and generous character. They thought that a person with pale, small ears was dangerous. They also thought that the shape of the ear showed if a person was musical. Today, too many people believe that the size and the shape of the ear help you know if a person is musical.
Ears are all different, and each characteristic has a meaning. Next time when you look at a person, see if his ears are large, medium-size or small. Look at the lobes (the lowest part of the ear). Do they stick to the face? Ears that are always red mean a person may easily get angry, or he / she just has high blood pressure  . Ears that are always cold and pale mean a person has a nervous character. And a big inside hole of the ear means a person is musical.",middle7625.txt
