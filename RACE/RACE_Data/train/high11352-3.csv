3,D,"['it is justifiable  to include English as a school subject', 'the author disagrees with the speaker over the standard of English at Grade 9 level', 'English language teaching is by no means an easy job', 'language improvement needs time and effort']",It can be concluded from the passage that   _  .,"The speaker, a teacher from a community college, addressed a sympathetic  audience. Heads nodded in agreement when he said, ""High school English teachers are not doing their jobs."" He described the inadequacies of his students, all high school graduates who can use language only at a grade 9 level. I was unable to determine from his answers to my questions how this grade 9 level had been established.
My topic is not standards nor its decline . What the speaker was really saying is that he is no longer young; he has been teaching for sixteen years, and is able to think and speak like a mature adult.
My point is that the frequent complaint of one generation about the one immediately following it is inevitable. It is also human nature to look for the reasons for our dissatisfaction. Before English became a school subject in the late nineteenth century, it was difficult to find the target of the blame for language deficiencies  . But since then, English teachers have been under constant attack.
The complainers think they have hit upon an original idea. As their own command of the language improves, they notice that young people do not have this same ability. Unaware that their own ability has developed through the years, they assume the new generation of young people must be hopeless in this respect. To the eyes and ears of sensitive adults the language of the young always seems inadequate.
Since this concern about the decline and fall of the English language is not perceived  as a generational phenomenon but rather as something new and peculiar  to today's         young people, it naturally follows that today's English teachers cannot be doing their jobs. Otherwise, young people would not commit offenses against the language.",high11352.txt
