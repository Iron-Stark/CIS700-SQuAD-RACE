0,C,"['he was young', 'he was hardworking', 'he was tall for his age', 'he was skillful at playing basketball']",Many schools offer Alcindor scholarships because   _  .,"When Lew Alcindor was 13, and obviously still growing, a group of schools began offering him scholarships  .  The Alcindors decided to send their only child to Power Memorial Academy, a small school on Manhattan's West Side.
    At Power, Alcindor came under the control of Coach Jack Donohue, a strict young an who already gained his fame as one of the best coaches in the city.Donohue brought Alcindor along slowly.As a first-year student, the boy was not able to do much but wave his long skinny arms and shoot a basket now and then.But by the second year, when he was 15 years old and nearly 7 feet tall, Alcindor was quick and skillful enough to make the high school All-American team and to lead Power to an undefeated season.
    From then on he simply got better.Some rival coaches  used to take their teams quickly away from the floor before Power warmed up so that their players would not see him any sooner than they had to.Wearing size 16 D shoes and sucking a lollipop , Alcindor would loosen up by starting his leaping lay-ups .Then he would casually shoot the ball with either hand, to the delight of the fans.
    When reporters and photographers began to follow Alcindor closely, Donohue protected his boy firmly.He simply ordered Lew to talk to no member of the press, and this suited Lew fine.He was not comfortable talking to grown-ups, perhaps because he towered over them.Discouraged photographers began following him in secret as though he were an easily-frightened giraffe.Once after ducking into a subway to escape, Alcindor told a friend that it was all becoming like policemen and robbers.""People want you not for yourself,"" Donohue warned him, ""but because you're a basketball player.Don't forget that.""",high21928.txt
