2,D,"['$6', '$ 30', '$ 20', '$ 36']","If you visit Boston by riding Hubway bike for 3 hours, you have to pay   _  .","The City Bike program rolled into New York last spring and proved a hit, with nearly 12,000 New Yorkers signing up for annual memberships. Since 2010, over a dozen US cities have introduced bike-share programs.
There're plenty of bike stations near parks and other car-free areas. The programs we looked at in major cities work the same way. You buy a 24-hour pass. During the time, you get an unlimited number of 30-minute rides. If you go over your given half-hour ride time, you start paying fees for each following 30-minute period. Here are some of the biggest bike-share program in America.
