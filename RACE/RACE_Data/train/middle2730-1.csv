The weather there is different from that of other areas of China. There is no winter in Hainan. It's not cold all year round. Many people go there in winter, because it's cold in the north of China. In summer, it's very hot. It's usually sunny, but it often rains. So people often take a pair of sunglasses and a raincoat at the same time. People can enjoy many kinds of fruits like bananas and coconuts there, too.
Hainan is a good place to go for holidays and have fun. People can go fishing, boating, swimming and so on. When we want to have a rest, we can walk on the beach   and enjoy the fresh air and white clouds. It's so interesting.
