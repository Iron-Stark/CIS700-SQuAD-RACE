1,C,"['too hard for young students to get through', 'a very important time for young students to break away from their parents', 'so exciting and challenging that the young should make balanced decisions for their future', 'a period when young students may pay little attention to their future plans']",The author thinks teenage stage is   _  .               .,"As you grow rapidly through your teenage years you will experience a lot of changes.
     The changes may seem monumental and they may seem to happen quickly. Don't panic! You will deal successfully with this time! The changes may seem difficult and your new-found responsibilities may seem daunting  but you're not alone. Everyone that you've grown up with is going through the same things!
     With more responsibilities you will find more freedom to make your own choices. This is a time to be well informed about your choices so that you can make healthy balanced decisions that will help shape your future. You may already know your career path or you may have no idea at all of what you want to do. Both situations are fine! If you are diligent, the right opportunity will be ready for you. Young adulthood means greater freedom and more choices. You will probably begin to want to do things independently of your family/ care-givers. Try not to shut your family out of your life and remember to be considerate even though you are older and are capable of looking after yourself. Your family have been with you since you came into this world and they will be around you when you leave this world.
     It is also perfectly natural in this time of transition to want to spend more time with your friends than your family. Choose your friends wisely. Real friends are rarer than hen's teeth. A true friend will stand with you, whatever the circumstances are.
     This period of transition is a part of the circle of life. There are some people who will be with you throughout the life's journey and there will be some people with whom you part and go separate ways. Leaving school/college can be hard. The reality is that you may not ever see all of your classmates again. Sure, there may be reunions and you will keep in touch with some of them. But the fact is you will need to leave some of them behind as you move forwards on the path that you feel is right for you.",high17774.txt
