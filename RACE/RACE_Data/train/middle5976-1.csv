1,B,"['Why the author had a hard time in France.', ""How the author changed a woman's life and got a job."", 'Kindness is necessary sometimes.', 'Getting a job is not so easy.']",What is the main idea of the text?,"I once had a hard time making a living in France. Three years ago, I moved to a new neighborhood and felt an intense  need to meet people so I went to the cinema. Outside the cinema was a woman with long gray hair who had a strong smell and was asking for money. I reached for my wallet to give her a Euro and then something made me stop and enter into conversation with her. I said, ""Look, all the women going to the cinema here on a Tuesday night are seeing a film that can change your life. I'd rather buy you a ticket than give you money.""
She hesitated  for a moment and then came in with me. She hid behind me because, she said, the people running the theater didn't like her. I got her a ticket and she sat next to me. There were about 80 women there; I noticed some of them were turning around and looking at me with expressions of surprise and curiosity .
I encouraged the woman I had bought the ticket for to come the following night to an event where there would be many representatives  of various social services. I thought they could be of some help to her. She did come and I was able to direct her to an agency that helped women in her situation. At the same time, a woman came toward me and said, ""Are you the person who bought a ticket for the woman outside the theater asking for _ When I said yes she said, ""I want you to come to the community center where I work. I want the other employees there to meet you.""
This was the beginning of a deep friendship and colleague relationship. I now have a great job and have more work than I've ever had in my 20 years in France. And the woman I took to the cinema that night? I learned that she was not homeless and that she was a secretary.",middle5976.txt
