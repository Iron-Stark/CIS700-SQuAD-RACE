2,D,"['admired the writer for the good service', 'was a customer easy to deal with', 'had patience to do the shopping', 'cared much about the wrapping of goods']",It can be inferred that the middle-aged woman  _  .,"""No, no, no, dear, I want that wrapped in red paper."" A middle-aged woman came through my line and talked to me as if my IQ were that of a grade school kid. When I first started working, it was simply a way to decrease   the time I spent at home and make my parents happy. I never thought that a year and a half later, I would still be at Marshalls, waiting for this woman to get through my line.
I smiled and said, ""Oh, that's no problem."" She bent over the counter to look at the computer and made sure I was doing my job correctly. Her sweater grazed my hand and she smiled like she meant well. I wanted to roll my eyes but instead I just smiled. Ever since I started working here, I've tried not to let people like her get to me. And forget judging a book by its cover, because I have been proved wrong time and time again. The wealthy middle-aged women were far ruder than the teenage boys. At first, I was constantly surprised. Now, I tried not to even guess how the person coming near my line was going to act, because it was never the way I imagine.
I never expected people to be so rude and at the same time nice. But for every rude person I saw, at least five pleasant customers came through my line.
""Here you go,"" I handed the woman her receipt and hoped her $5 wine glass was wrapped to her liking. ""Have a nice day!"" I said. And just as I thought I was fed up, the next customer came through. ""She had about one more minute and I was going to tell her to get out of line,"" she whispered   to me with a smile.",high8922.txt
