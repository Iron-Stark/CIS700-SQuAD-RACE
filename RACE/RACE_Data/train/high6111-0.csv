0,C,"['Because they both wanted to live a quiet life', ""Because they couldn't get along well with each other"", 'Because they wanted to test the power of their prayers', 'Because they wanted to keep their own life secret from others']",Why didn't the two men stay together on the island?,"A ship was damaged during a storm at sea and only two of the men aboard were able to swim to a small island. Not knowing what else to do, the two survivors decided that they should pray to God.
However, to find out whose prayers were more powerful, they agreed to divide the land between them and stay on opposite sides of the island.
The first thing they prayed for was food. The next morning, the first man saw a tree on his side of the island, and he was able to eat its fruit. But the other man's side of land remained _ 
After a week, the first man became lonely and decided to pray for a wife. The next day, another ship was damaged and the only survivor was a woman who swam to his side of the island. But on the other side of the island, there was nothing.
Soon the first man prayed for a house, clothes and more food. The next day, like magic, all of these things were given to him. However, the second man still had nothing.
Finally, the first man prayed for a ship so that he and his wife could leave the island, and in the morning he found a ship stopped at his side of the island.
The first man boarded the ship with his wife and decided to leave the second man on the island. As the ship was about to leave, the first man heard a voice from Heaven, ""Why are you leaving your partner on the island?""
""My blessings are mine alone since I was the one who prayed for them."" The first man answered. "" His prayers were all unanswered so he doesn't deserve anything.""
""You are mistaken!"" the voice said. ""He had only one prayer, which I answered. He prayed that all your prayers would be answered.""",high6111.txt
