0,D,"['Earthquakes usually last 10 to 30 seconds.', 'After a big earthquake, there are many more quakes.', 'Cracks in an earthquake are very dangerous.', 'What usually injures people during an earthquake are falling buildings.']",Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?.,"An earthquake is a trembling or shaking of the ground caused by the sudden release  of energy stored in the rocks below the surface. Generally, earthquakes last only seconds. Strong ground shaking during a medium  to large earthquake generally lasts about 10 to 30 seconds. Aftershocks  can occur once in a while for weeks or even months.
Many people think that there is an ""earthquake season"" or a kind of "" earthquake weather "".As a matter of fact, there isn't. Earthquakes can occur at any time of the year and at time of day or night. Earthquakes occur under all weather conditions-sunny, wet. or cold without any special weather tendency .
Also, you don't need to worry that the ground will open up and swallow people when earthquakes occur. Open ground cracks may form during an earthquake, for example, to land sliding or ground falling. However, such cracks tend to be open gaps (they don't "" swallow"") that a person could stand in afterwards.
The safest place in an earthquake is an open field because buildings and falling objects can injure or kill you. If you are indoors, when you feel the ground start to shake, take cover immediately under a table or strong piece of furniture, placing something between falling objects and yourself. Don't "" attempt to use the stairs or an elevator to get out of the building..",high8242.txt
