Each autumn in the pine forests of central prefix = st1 /Mexico, one of the greatest natural phenomena appears, as tens of millions of beautiful orange Monarch butterflies pour into the trees to spend the winter months.
Some of them have migrated several thousand kilometres from their breeding   grounds in North America and Canada, but although they've never been here before, they travel south and find their way to an area not much bigger than the English county of Devon. 
Although they coat the trees and when they take flight, look like an orange snowstorm, these butterflies are under threat at both ends of their journey.The pine forest are being cut down illegally by gangs of loggers, despite protection from the Mexican government. 
Local people need timber and firewood to survive. Where the butterflies breed in North America, their foodplant, the milkweed, is being killed by herbicides and agricultural practices, and the Monarch's migration is in danger.With location reports from the Mexican forests, Brett Westwood explores how steps are being taken to develop sustainable forestry to help preserve this magnificent insect.",high17975.txt
