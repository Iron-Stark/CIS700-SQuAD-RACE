2,C,"[""his and his father's common love of German food"", 'watching a top level performance of the players', ""his father's love of football and his explanation"", 'eating in a restaurant with the excited fans']",The author's growing interest in watching the match mainly came from  _  .,"For most of my 15 years, my father usually said very little to my mother and me. He preferred reading the newspaper or watching football matches on television to talking to his family.
Everything changed one morning. As soon as I came downstairs to breakfast, I could see that he wasn't his usual reserved   self. ""Can't wait! FIFA World Cup! Big match! Must see!""    I quickly figured out what all the excitement was about: Dad is a big football fan.
I had never been interested in football, but Dad's excitement that morning made me more and more curious. I had to find out why this sport was making my normally reserved father act like a five-year-old on his first trip to Disneyland.
Dad decided that we should all eat at a little German restaurant so that we could watch the World Cup while eating. Secretly, I think he was hoping to turn Mum and me into football fans.
The match started a few minutes after we entered the restaurant. As I was eating my meal, a loud noise came from the television. Surprised, I looked up at the TV: ""Why is that man jumping up and down?"" Dad patiently explained: ""That's Papa Bouba Diop, my son. It's normal for them to jump up and down after they've scored.""
Dad explained almost everything to me. His monosyllabic   answers were a thing of the past. I loved the new Dad! I watched the rest of the match, becoming more and more interested. When I told my father that I planned to watch more matches with him, he smiled and gave me a wink  . At long last we had something in common.
