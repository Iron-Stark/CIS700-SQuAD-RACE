1,C,"['decided to go back to his own country', 'felt the local people were not very friendly', 'had to find a job to cover his living expenses', 'wanted to get a job that needed practical skills']","After staying in New Zealand for a short time, the author","When I began planning to move to Auckland to study,my mother was a little worried about the uncertainty of living in a place that was so different from India,where we lived. She worried particularly about the lack of jobs,the cultural differences and the chance that I would face racism.
Despite these worries,I came to New Zealand in July 2009. I have found the place and people very nice and supportive. Soon after I arrived,I realized the importance of getting a job to supply my living expenses.
Determined to do this on my own ,I spent a whole day going from door to door asking for a job. However,I received little or no response. This became my routine every day after college for a few weeks.
One afternoon,I walked into a building to ask if there were any job opportunities. The people there were very surprised,and advised me not to continue my job search in that manner.
As I was about to leave,a clerk in the building,who had been listening to what the others had said, approached me and asked if I would wait outside. Fifteen minutes later,he returned. He asked me what my plans were and encouraged me to stay confident. He then offered to take me to the Royal Oak area to search for a job.
I was a little surprised,but had a good feeling about him,so I went along. Along the way, I realized that I had run out of copies of my resume .The man stopped at his business partner's office to make me 15 extra copies. He also gave me tips on dressing and speaking,and added that I should give him, a call if I ever needed anything. I handed out my resumes and went home feeling very satisfied. The following day,I received:call from. store in Royal Oak offering me a job.
It seems that the world always gives back to you when you need it. And this time,it was a complete stranger who turned out to be a real blessing.",high11049.txt
