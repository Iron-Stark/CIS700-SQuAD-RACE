0,D,"['Happy.', 'Nervous.', 'Worried.', 'Surprised.']",How did Kendall feel when she watched The Oprah Winfrey Show?,"Kendall Ciesemier says she's like any other schoolgirl. She keeps herself busy with school, friends and family. There is one thing, though. Not many other 14-year-olds can say they run a successful charity helping children in Africa. In three years, the eighth-grader from the US has raised $100,000 for African AIDS orphans  .    
    Kendall knew she had to help the children of Sub-Saharan Africa once their terrible situation was shown on The Oprah Winfrey Show. ""I could not imagine how I would go through such a hard time that they would have to go through,"" Kendall says. She took $360 of her own savings to help a little girl from Zambia that same night.  
    That was just the start. Kendall sold bread and soft drinks with her classmates at her school to raise more money. She also sold ""Bow-Wow Bling Bling"" dog necklaces to raise more. The money helps children pay for things like shoes and school uniforms. Kendall says, ""A uniform to go to school costs $10. Ten dollars. Here, it's not a lot of money, but there, that means too much money. I mean, it could change a whole kid's life."" 
    Kendall has had her own health struggles. She was born with a disease called biliary atresia  , and had two liver transplants   in 2004. ""I'm just a girl who wants to help those kids who are in trouble,"" said Kendall.",high22240.txt
