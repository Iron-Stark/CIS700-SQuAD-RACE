2,D,"['$ 8.00.', 'Ten dollars.', 'All his money.', 'All his money and another $ 8.00.']",How much were the clothes that the boy wanted to buy?,"I noticed that the little boy was paying mostly with change  . It seemed that he had broken his pig bank   to do this shopping. However, the cashier told him he was $ 8.00 short after counting his money.
It was clear that the boy had already used all the money. The lady in front of me said, ""Well, I could pay half of that."" I told the boy that I could pay the other half. We searched our handbags. However, both of us only had ten-dollar bills  . Other customers behind began searching their pockets to find some change. It was amazing and moving that all these strangers seemed to have the same idea. All of us wanted to help the boy. Within minutes the cashier said, ""I have too much money."" The cashier didn't need our ten-dollar bills. Then the lady in front of me said, ""Wait! I didn't get a chance to give anything!""
I smiled at her and said, ""You did your share, because it was your idea and you started all this."" The little boy smiled and thanked us. I was left with a good feeling. I saw the love and goodness of others all around me. The woman in front of me smiled and said, ""It feels good to give, doesn't it?"" I smiled back and said, ""Yes!""
