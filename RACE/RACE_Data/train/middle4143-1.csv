1,A,"['Eating a delicious meal', 'Telling friends that their lives are better', 'Helping find a cure for cancer', 'Smiling at a stranger']",Which of the following does not change the world for the better?,"Everyone dreams of changing the world. But can teenagers really make a difference? And how can they go about it?
Michael Norton's book 365 Ways to Change the World is a good starting point. The book gives an idea or task for every single day of the year. The tasks include offering to work at a local homeless shelter   and planting a tree.
The book says that one simple act, no matter how small, can help someone in need. It may even influence   other teens to do something.
Nathan Anthony, a student at Maple High School in Modesto, California, US, agrees. ""It is impossible to get anything in life without giving something to someone or working hard at school or workplace,"" Anthony said.
Another Maple student, Ariane Mota, has the same idea."" Giving is our way of repaying those who help us,"" she said."" Whether it is a helping hand or a donation, we should help others to make their day or life better.""
But how often do teens see peers   helping a stranger or doing something nice for someone?
According to Anthony, not a lot. He and Mota both believe this needs to be changed.
""I help my friends by telling them that their lives are better than those poorer people,"" Anthony said."" Humor is also a great tool.""
So whether you're helping to find a cure   for bad illness or simply smiling at a stranger, do something every day to help change the world for the better.",middle4143.txt
