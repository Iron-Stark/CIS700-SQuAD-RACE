0,C,"['On foot.', 'By bike.', 'By bus.', 'By taxi.']",How does Jasson go to school?,"Hello! I'm Jason. On Monday, I usually wake up late and have no time to have breakfast. I can't find my books or my school cap. At last, I find my books and my school cap in the bathroom. I have to wait for a bus and I am nearly late for school.
The first lesson on Monday morning is Maths. I like it because I'm good at Maths.
The next lesson is French. I like French. It's nice to be able to talk with somebody in another language.
At last, it is eleven o'clock -- time for break. After having a break, we have two Latin lessons. There are a lot of boys in our class who don't like Latin. I don't like it, either.
At half past twelve, it is time for lunch -- a meat pie, potatoes or cabbage and a glass of juice or milk. Then I go to the playground with my friends, and we play football there.
After lunch, we have a History lesson. The History teacher tells us many interesting things.
After school, my friends and I usually go for a walk. I come home very late, and my mother is very angry.",middle5791.txt
