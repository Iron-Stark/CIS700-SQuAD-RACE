Honeybees can do three kinds of jobs.  
It is one of the most unusual insects in the world. Bees are special because they divide up their honeybee work. Each bee has a certain job to do. 
The busiest bee is the worker. Workers build the nest, called a hive. Inside the hive, workers make a honeycomb from wax . They store honey there for food. Workers are always cleaning and fixing the hive. They even stand at the opening and fan their wings to cool the hive. Worker bees will attack anything--even people--to keep their hive safe. 
Another kind of bee is the drone . Drones are male bees, and their job is to fly with the queen bee and mate with her. After the queen mates, the worker bees drive the drones away. The drones then starve to death. 
The third kind of bee is the queen. Each hive needs only one queen, and her job is laying eggs. She can lay as many as 2, 000 eggs a day.",high20717.txt
