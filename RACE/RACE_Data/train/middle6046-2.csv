2,C,"['He hits his drum with his grandfather.', 'He watches TV with Mrs Black.', 'He sleeps in bed.', 'He does his homework with his grandfather.']","When his father gets home in the evening, what does Jimmy do?","It's Jimmy's birthday and he is 9 years old. He gets a lot of presents from his family and one of them is a big drum  . His grandfather buys it for him.
Jimmy likes it very much. He plays with it every day and he often makes a terrible noise  . His father works in the day and Jimmy is in bed when he gets home in the evening. So his father doesn't hear the noise.
But Mrs Black doesn't like the noise, so one morning she takes a knife and goes to Jimmy's room when he hits his drum. She says to him, ""Hello! Jimmy. Do you know there is something very nice in your drum? Here is a knife. Please open the drum and let's find it.""",middle6046.txt
