Thanks for your letter and for the photos of your family. Now it's my turn! This is a photo of my family. My dad is called Peter. He's a dentist. He likes playing golf and he loves watching sports on TV. In fact, we all like watching TV! My mom's name is Diana. She's a teacher. She likes reading and she also likes watching romantic movies.
I have two brothers-James and Brian. James is nine years old. He likes watching cartoons and playing video games. Little Brian is still a baby. He's only two years old. He doesn't like watching TV! He likes playing with his teddy bear.
And me? Well, I like watching tennis on TV but I prefer to play. Do you like playing tennis? I do. Maybe we can play some time? What do you like to do? Write and tell me.
Yours truly,                                           Debbie",middle5986.txt
