Padma
Padma is a quiet boy who sits next to me. He is so soft that one would think that he is a girl .This is not so. No one dares to call him""girl"", for he is a member of the school karate club.
Doris
Doris is such a model student that all the teachers love her, She sits right in front of the teachers table.We all love her because she is kind and helpful. Every day, she makes sure that the teachers have enough chalk and the classroom is clean.
