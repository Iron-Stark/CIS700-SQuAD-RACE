If you don't, you may want to read the book We Can Do written by Moshe Kai Cavalin. It might change your mind.
Moshe Kai Cavalin is a 14-year-old American boy. He is about to graduate from UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) this year. Before that, he had already gotten a degree   from East Los Angeles Community College in 2009.
Recently, Cavalin published   the book We Can Do. In this book, he talks about how to achieve things we want, by keeping yourself focused   and trying your best to do everything. He says this doesn't need genius  , just hard work.
Cavalin says being called a genius ""has always bothered   me... People need to know they don't have to be geniuses; they just need to work hard and they can achieve anything. If I can reach the stars, others can reach the Milky Way(,).""
The idea of writing a book came from a teacher named Richard Avila at his first college. Cavalin says Avila inspired   him to write a book to explain how he succeeded, so he could inspire other people.
It took Cavalin four years to finish the book. Because his mother is Chinese, she wanted to publish the book in Chinese. So Cavalin translated the book into Chinese by himself. The book did well in Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia.",middle4314.txt
