3,B,"['Detroit Symphony gives a good performance', 'Honda robot conducts Detroit Symphony', '""The Impossible Dream"" from Detroit Symphony', 'Cooperation between Honda and Detroit Symphony']",What would be the best title for this passage?,"The lights dimmed,the musical hall grew quiet and out walked the conductor   shiny and white and 4 feet and 3 inches tall.
ASIMO, a robot designed by Honda Motor Co., met its latest challenge Tuesday evening: Conducting the Detroit Symphony  , in a performance of ""The Impossible  Dream"" from ""Man of La Mancha"".
""Hello, everyone,"" ASIMO said to the audience in a childlike voice, then waved to the orchestra. As it conducted, it perfectly mimicked   the actions of a conductor,
nodding its head at various sections and gesturing with one or both hands. ASIMO took a final bow to excited shouts from the audience. Later, cellist Yo-Yo Ma joined ASIMO onstage to receive an award for his efforts in music education.
Honda spokeswoman Alicia Jones says it is the first time ASIMO has conducted an orchestra, and it may be the first time any robot has conducted a live performance. But ASIMO has its  limits. ASIMO's engineers programmed the robot to mimic Charles Burke, the Detroit Symphony's education director, as he conducted the piece in front of a pianist about six months ago. But it can't respond to the musicians.
""It's not a communicative device. It simply is programmed to do a set of gestures,"" said Leonard Slatkin, the orchestra's musical director. ""If the orchestra decides to go faster, there's nothing the robot can do about it. Hopefully, I keep that under control.""
But several musicians also said ASIMO was more realistic than they expected. ""The movements are still a little stiff  , but very humanlike, much better than I thought,"" Hutchinson said.",high15476.txt
