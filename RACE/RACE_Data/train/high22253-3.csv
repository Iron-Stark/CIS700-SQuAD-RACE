3,A,"['Keeping him farther away from the rocks.', 'Keeping Mr Popple swimming in the sea.', 'Asking him to have a good rest.', 'Keeping him floating everywhere.']","According to the text, what was the most important thing to do for the three men?","Three surfers rushed to save a man's life after he was left drifting on a notorious stretch of water.
The men stayed with Greg Popple for 30 minutes and had to be rescued themselves by helicopter as the drama unfolded. 
The 45-year-old had floated out on a body board near Hutchwns Point at 8:30 am. He found himself in trouble about half-a-mile from the shore and dangerously close to rocks. Surfers Graig Evans, 31, Robert Miles, 19, and Owain Daviees, 23, were risking their own safety to keep him floating for 30 minutes. Luckily a passer-by noticed what was going on and raised the alarm. Porthcawl Coastguard, Porthcaw Lifeboat and an RAF helicopter all took part in the rescue. 
""The man who got into trouble was a body boarder-there was a big tide where he was,"" said Joe Missen. ""Three other surfers spotted he was in difficulty and he was going down. They kept him afloat because he was in a state of shock and out of energy. If Mr. Popple was closer to the rocks, it could have been a lot worse, but they managed to keep him from harm"".
Mr. Missen's mum Alison, also part of the rescue team, said, ""That part of the water is notorious for taking people out to nowhere"".
The three men had clocked off a night shift at Ford Motor Company shortly before the incident. 
""I headed straight down to the beach for a surf, when I saw him flailing . We just swam straight out to him and kept him calm while the help came"".
The four men were taken to the life boat house to recover, without injuries.",high22253.txt
