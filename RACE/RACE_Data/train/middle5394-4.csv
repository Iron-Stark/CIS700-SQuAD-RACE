Oct.8th,Sunday
October 1st is our National Day.It was Sunday.In the morning,our teacher took us to the park.Oh,many people were there.We could see flags and flowers everywhere.We saw people dancing in the park everywhere.We had a good time.
This morning I did some cleaning.Then I went to school.In the class,our teacher told us a very interesting story.It was about a French scientist Ampere.Once he was walking in the street when he began to work on a problem on a""blackboard""with a piece of chalk.But it was not a blackboard.It was the back of a carriage .Ampere didn't notice  it at all.How hard he worked at his problem!
In the evening,it became cloudy.It's going to rain tomorrow,I think.",middle5394.txt
