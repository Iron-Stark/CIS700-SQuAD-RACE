0,C,"['To tell people what makes a good movie.', 'To tell people how to enjoy the humor in The Sound of Music.', 'To explain why The Sound of Music is one of the best movies.', 'To advise people to watch The Sound of Music']",What's the purpose of the passage?,"While many people agree that The Sound of Music is one of the best films of all time, some are at a loss  to explain why. Well, I'll tell you why it's one of the best movies ever. The Sound of Music simply has everything one could want in a movie.
First of all, it has a real romance--one where you can watch the _ slowly fall in love.
Secondly, it has humor, clever and sarcastic  humor. When Schraeder said, "" Bye, Maria, I'm sure you'll make a fine nun ."" You just want to slap  her across the face after hearing that.
Thirdly, it's got adventure. The Nazis are the worst ""bad guys"" in any movie, so it's great to see Maria, the Captain and the kids outwit  them.
Fourthly, it's got great music. The songs of the film are popular all over the world.
Fifthly, it's got great scenery. The plot  and dialogue are also amazing. I find new things to admire each time I watch.
Finally, is there a greater scene in any movie than the nuns showing the stolen Nazi car parts? In short, the film doesn't just succeed because it cheers people up with a beautiful love story or songs. It also succeeds because it's a wonderfully-constructed, wonderfully-written, and wonderfully-acted movie.",high6861.txt
