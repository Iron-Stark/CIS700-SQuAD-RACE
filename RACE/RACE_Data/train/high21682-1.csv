1,B,"[""there're more women liars"", 'fewer women liars are found out', 'women tell less harmful lies', 'women are harder to convince']",Most people think women are better liars because   _  .,"Britain's most popular lie has been disclosed, with one in four people admitting using ""Sorry I had no signal"" when returning a missed mobile phone call, a survey found. 
Researchers found the average Briton tells on average four lies every day or almost 1500 every year. Almost one in six men admitted they were most likely to lie to their wife or girlfriend, on average at least twice a day. The most popular lie was saying you had no mobile phone signal, with one in four people admitting regularly using the little white lie. It usually came after they hit the ""ignore"" button when their mobile rang. 
Three quarters of people think women are better liars. The research found 46 per cent of girls have been caught lying, compared to 58 of men. 
The second most common fib  is ""I haven't got any cash on me"" when asked for money by tramps  , beggars and Big Issue sellers. ""Nothing's wrong - I'm fine"" came third followed by ""You look lovely"" and ""Nice to see you"".  
Modern technology turned out to have contributed to many lies with ""I didn't get your text"" in 18th, ""Our server was down"" in 20th and ""My battery died"" in 26th place. 
Other lies to make the top ten included ""I'll give you a ring"", ""We're just good friends"" and ""We'll have to meet up soon"". ""I'm on my way"" and ""No, your bum doesn't look big in that"" completed the top ten. 
Men tell the most fibs, coming out with five every day compared to women who lie just three times. 
In many cases perhaps it is better to flatter with a fib than destroy someone with the truth, according to a spokesman for OnePoll, which carried out the research of 4,300 adults.",high21682.txt
