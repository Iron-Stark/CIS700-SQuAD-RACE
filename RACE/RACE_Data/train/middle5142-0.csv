0,A,"['A TV play.', 'A popular song.', 'A spacecraft.', 'An alien.']",What is Star Trek?,"The first part of a new science-fiction series  was shown on NBC last night. Star Trek is about a spacecraft which travels faster than the speed of light. The show is developed from three ideas about the 22ndcentury. First, we'll find other life forms great tools which will make amazing things possible.
Let's think about these predictions. If we find life forms on other planets, will they be intelligent? I hope so. But we human beings might not be friendly - I don't think we'll believe in the idea of peace one hundred years from now. But this is science fiction, so we can be _ ! And Star Trek's idea of life in the future is 'communicators'. And we will be ablt to have conversatins with people who are on because you'll have an electronic notebook. And if you get ill, the doctor won't have to examine you - a machine will 'read' your body. The strangest manchine includes a 'teleport' which will take people to a different placein a second!
The ideas are interesting, and in my opinion there's only one problem with star trek: the acting. The TV company  will have to get better actors. If they do that, the show might be a success. If the acting doesn't improve, Star Trek won't last for more than one series. Of course, my prediction may be wrong. I can't see into the future!",middle5142.txt
