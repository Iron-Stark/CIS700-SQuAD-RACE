0,B,"['On the beach.', 'On the mountain.', 'In the rice fields.', 'At home.']",Where was Yuuki when the earthquake struck?,"For hundreds of years, Japan has been hit, from time to time, by tsunamis , which are caused by earthquakes or underwater volcanoes. The story of the boy Yuuki is the story of such a disaster.
Yuuki lived with his family in a seaside village, below a small mountain. One day, as he played on top of the mountain, Yuuki felt a small earthquake but it was not strong enough to frighten anybody. Soon after, however, Yuuki noticed the sea darken and begin running away from the shore very fast, leaving behind wide areas of beach that had never been seen before.
Yuuki remembered reading that just before a terrible tsunami, the sea suddenly and quickly rolls backward. He ran to the beach, warning the villagers who had gathered to admire the new beach land.
But no one listened. They laughed at him and continued playing in the new sand.
Desperate, Yuuki could think of only one thing to do. He lit a tree branch, raced to the rice fields and began burning the harvested rice. Then he called out, ""Fire! Fire! Everyone run to the mountain! Now!""
When everyone reached the mountain top, a villager cried out, ""Yuuki is mad! I saw him set the fire."" Yuuki hung his head in shame, but said nothing as the villagers screamed at him.
Just then, someone shouted, ""Look!""
In the distance a huge dark wave of water was speeding towards the shore. When it hit the shore, it destroyed everything.
On the mountain everyone stared at the village ruins in terror.
""I'm sorry I burned the fields,"" said Yuuki, his voice trembling.
""Yuuki,"" the village chief answered. ""You saved us all.""
The villagers cheered and raised Yuuki into the air. ""We were going to celebrate our rice harvest tonight,"" said one, ""but now we'll celebrate that we're all still alive!""",high12491.txt
