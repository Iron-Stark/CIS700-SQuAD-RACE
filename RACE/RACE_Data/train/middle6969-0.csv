The shopkeeper took out a pair of new shoes, and let him try it on. But when he looked into his pocket, he found that the straw was not there. So he said, ""I'm sorry, I forgot to bring the size  here! Let me go home to get it."" After that, he ran out of the shop. It was very far from his home to the shoe shop.
