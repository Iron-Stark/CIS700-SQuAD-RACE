0,C,"['longer, stronger', 'say, day', 'day, away', 'A, B and C']","In the poem, which words rhyme with ""say""?","What does little birdie say,
In her nest at peep of day?
Let me fly, says little birdie,
Mother, let me fly away,
Birdie, rest a little longer,
Till the little wings are stronger.
So she rests a little longer,
Then she flies away.
What does little baby say,
In her bed at peep of day?
Baby says, like little birdie,
Let me rise and fly away.
Baby, sleep a little longer,
Till the little limbs  are stronger.
If she sleeps a little longer,
Baby too shall fly away.",middle3473.txt
