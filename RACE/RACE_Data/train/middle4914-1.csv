1,B,"['Once.', 'Twice.', 'Three times.', 'Eight times.']",How many times a month does the writer go to the restaurant?,"My favourite restaurant is called 'Annablella's cafe'. It is a small restaurant serving  Western food. It is in a city called Bristol. It is difficult to find because it is behind a very tall building. Only local people eat at this restaurant, and visitors can never find it! I think the food at the restaurant is the best in the whole country.
I like to go to this restaurant every two weeks. The waiters know me very well now. They are my friends. They know what my favourite drink is, so when I arrive, there is always a bottle of coke on the table. The menu changes every week so there is always something different to eat. My favourite meat is chicken, so I always order something with chicken in it. For dessert , I usually have apple pie with custard or chocolate cake. Delicious!
Sometimes I go to this restaurant for breakfast. I have a typical  English breakfast: eggs, bacon, sausages, tomatoes and bread. The breakfast is delicious, but I like to eat at this restaurant at dinnertime better.",middle4914.txt
