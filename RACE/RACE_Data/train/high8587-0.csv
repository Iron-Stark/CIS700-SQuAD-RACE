Onruang said, ""I buried them at home. Each time I visit them, I say, 'Hi, I'm making a new body for you.'""
Finally, Onruang found the South Korean biotechnology company RNL Bio, which can and will clone animals. Onruang collected his dogs' stem cells  , and then he started a website MyFriendAgain.com, so he could earn and save the $310,000 that the cloning would cost.
The new dogs should look identical   to Wolfie and Bubble. When the cloning process is done, Onruang may end up with several clones of each dog. But Onruang admits he's still not sure that they will be exactly the same.
