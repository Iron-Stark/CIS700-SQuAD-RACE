He didn't like doing any work. He had to go to school, of course, but he didn't study hard there and tried to do little work. His father and mother were both doctors and they hoped that their son would become one too when he grew up. But one day Jack said to his mother, ""When I finish school, I want to be a dustman .""
""A dustman?"" his mother asked. She was very surprised. ""That's not a good job. Why do you want to become a dustman?""
""Because I would only have to work one day a week,"" Jack answered at once.

""Well,"" Jack answered, ""I know that the dustman came to work on Thursday every week, because I only see them on that day.""",middle1412.txt
