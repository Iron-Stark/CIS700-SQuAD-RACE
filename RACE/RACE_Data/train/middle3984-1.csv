1,A,"['After her father got sick seriously.', 'Before her father got sick seriously.', 'After her mother gave her father some flowers.', 'After her father gave her mother some flowers.']",When did the writer understand her mother's answer?,"Sometimes I really doubt whether there is love between my parents. Every day they don't act in the romantic ways that I read in books or I see on TV. In their opinion, ""I love you"" is too luxurious for them to say. Sending flowers on Valentine's Day is even more out of the question.
One day, my mother was sewing a quilt .
""Mom, I have a question to ask you.""
""What?"" she replied, still doing her work.
""Is there love between you and Dad?""
My mother stopped her work and raised her head with surprise in her eyes. Then she said, ""Susan, look at this thread. Sometimes it appears, but most of it disappears in the quilt. The _ really makes the quilt strong and durable. If life is a quilt, then love should be a thread. Love is inside.""
I listened carefully but I couldn't understand until the next spring. At that time, my father suddenly got sick seriously. After they were back from the hospital, my mother helped him walk slowly on the beautiful country road every morning. My father had never been so gentle. But after two months he still couldn't walk by himself. All of us were worried about him.
""Dad, how are you feeling now?"" I asked him one day.
""Susan, don't worry about me, ""he said gently. ""To tell you the truth, I just like walking with your mom. ""Reading his eyes, I know he loves my mother deeply.
Once I thought love meant flowers, gifts and sweet kisses. But from this experience, I understand that love is just a thread in the quilt of our life. Love is inside, making life strong and warm.
