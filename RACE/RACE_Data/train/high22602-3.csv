3,D,"['Obama is a member of the Republicans.', 'The passage was written after the presidential election.', ""Doris Goodwin is one of Obama's assistants."", 'In the end Lincoln was able to get the support of the people who once hated him.']",What can we infer from the passage?,"Barack Obama has never been shy about comparing himself with Abraham Lincoln. He did so when he announced his presidential election in Illinois, where both he and Lincoln served in the legislature  . ""The life of a tall, thin, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible."" Obama said. ""He tells us that there is power in words and that there is power in hope."" Such comparisons have continued on big and small occasions, but the most important similarity, in Obama's mind, is how he plans to govern if elected.
Obama says he admires Doris Kearns Goodwin' s wonderful Lincoln biography, Team of Rivals. ""He talks about it all the time."" says a top assistant. ""He is particularly interested in the idea that Lincoln successfully won the hearts of many people who had run against him for President, some of them even disagree with him firmly."" ""The lesson is that you shouldn't let your hatred   get in the way of hiring  ly the best people."" says Obama. ""I think American people are practical and so I have an interest in casting a wide net, seeking out people with a wide range of expert knowledge, including Republicans, for the highest positions in the government.""
""I don't want to have people who just agree with me."" He says. ""I want people who are continually pushing me forward and I'd be very interested in having those sorts of Republicans in my government, especially people who can speed up a responsible and logical conclusion to the Iraq war.""",high22602.txt
