         The population of citizens aged above sixty in Shanghai City in east China has reached 2.46 million, accounting for nearly 18.6 percent of its total population, a local official said today.
         Shen Zhenxin, deputy director of Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau, says that the figure mainly shows a social problem brought by the increase in the numbers of elderly people, according to Tuesday's China Daily.
         Shanghai was the first city in the country to have an aging society-with 10.07 percent of the population of pensionable age in 1979. It is predicted(told in advance)that the rise in the city's elderly population will reach its top between 2025 to 2030, the newspaper reports.
         A recent survey(study)also shows that the population above the age of 60 in China has amounted to(reached)some 132 million so far, and the figure is increasing by 3.2 percent each year.
         ""Yet fewer children have been born these years, so the social security system should be improved as soon as possible,"" said Shen.
         Shanghai has chosen some communities as pilot neighborhoods to carry out a help-each-other program in an attempt to solve the problem. People can help take care of the elderly people, and they in turn will be looked after by others when they get old, according to China Daily.",high22683.txt
