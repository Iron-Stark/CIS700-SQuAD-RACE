0,B,"['The man was rich.', 'The man had no hands.', 'They knew each other.', ""He is Alex Ruiz's father.""]",Why did Alex Ruiz help the man eat his lunch?,"When a customer came into a Mexican restaurant in Georgia with an unusual request, a selfless waiter didn't hesitate  to help him out.
A disabled man with no hands who ordered a meal at Cinco cle Mayo Mexican Grill in Douglasville on Sunday afternoon hoped someone might be able to help him eat his lunch.
Server Alex Ruiz, 22, was more than happy to help as he sat opposite from the man and helped him enjoy his meal.
The heartwarming moment was captured in a photo by one of Ruiz's workmates, Crystal Figueroa. She posted it on the restaurant's Facebook page.
""He's a great person,"" Figuero, 24, whose father manages the restaurant, said.
""He's always so nice, and the fact that he just came out of nowhere and helped a man he doesn't even know have a meal says everything. That just shows the person that he is.
One of Figueroa's friends, Reginald Widener, also witnessed the moment and posted the photo on his Facebook page.
""This seriously hit me right in the soul,"" Widener wrote.
The waiters did not get the name of the man. He had never eaten in the restaurant before, according to Figueroa. But Ruiz jumped at the chance to help.
""I just feel like people should see that there're still good people out there,"" Figueroa said. ""It was just a happy moment.""",high14554.txt
