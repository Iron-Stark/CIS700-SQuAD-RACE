This mean ""you are not telling the truth"".', 'The deaf are also taught to see a finger alphabet.']",Which of the sentences is wrong?,"For many years, we couldn't talk with the deaf. These deaf people couldn't use a spoken language.
But beginning in the 1700s, the deaf were taught a special language. Using this language, they could share thoughts and ideas with others. The language they used was a language without sound. It was a sign language.
How did this sign language work? The deaf learnt to make certain movements with their hands, faces and bodies. These movements stood for things and ideas. People might move their forefingers across their lips. This meant ""you are not telling the truth"". They might tap their chin with three fingers. This meant ""my uncle"".
The deaf learned to see a finger alphabet. They used their fingers to make the letters of the alphabet. In this way, they spelled out words. Some deaf people could spell out words at a speed of 130 words per minute.
The deaf don't use the sign language and finger spelling as much as they once were. Today, the deaf learn to understand others by watching their lips. They also learn how to speak.",middle5166.txt
