1,B,"['they can live in it', 'it can reach the heaven', 'it can take many things', 'they can see the world on it']","People want to build the tower high, then   _  .","Hello,my friend.I'm Jack.Today I'd like to tell you a story about the language.People live together and they speak the same language.They are kind to each other .
People want to build a tower.One of them says, ""Let's build it high and it can reach the heaven  !"".And the name is the Tower of Babel.But God doesn't like it.""I will stop   them!"" God says.
People can work together because they can speak the same language.So God makes people speak different language.This is a big problem.Someone asks for water,people give him clothes.They can't understand each other.So people are not friendly.They don't like building the tower.
People begin to speak different languages and live in different places.They never finish building the Tower of Babel.",middle5542.txt
