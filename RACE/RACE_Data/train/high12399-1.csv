In addition, it has been programmed to give out two kinds of pleasant smells to match its emotions.
The 1.5 tall robot was produced by researchers at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) and is the first South Korean- developed machine of its kind.
""'Mahru' will open the way for the commercial use of humanoid robots doing housework,"" You Bum-Jae, leader of the development research team ,said. ""'Mahru' can dance while walking on its legs and is able to work in place of a human.""
Through an advanced motion capture   system, ""Mahru"" can follow a variety of human movements and move its hands freely enough to deal with any obstacles that may get in its way when walking.
State-funded KIST showed the robot during a presentation at its head office in Seoul.
People here were treated to an entertaining demonstration which saw the robot show off the full range of its skills, most notably s series of dance moves.
