3,A,"['Because he thought if he bought them, he could read.', 'Because they were very bright.', 'Because they were cheap.', 'Because he could read newspaper.']",Why did Tom decide to buy a pair of glasses?,"Tom lived by himself a long way from town. He hardly went to town, but one day he went into town to buy a few things. After he bought them, he went into a restaurant and sat down at a table. When he looked around, he saw some old people put glasses on before reading their newspapers. So after lunch he decided to go to a shop to buy himself one pair, too. He walked along the road, and soon found a shop.
The man in the shop let him try on a lot of glasses, but Tom always said, ""No, I can't read with these.""
The man became puzzled   , and he said, ""Excuse me, but can you read?""
""No, of course I can't!"" Tom said angrily. ""If I could read before, do you think I would come here to buy your glasses?""",middle3759.txt
