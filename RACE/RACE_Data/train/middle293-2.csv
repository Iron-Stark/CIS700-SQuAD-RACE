2,C,"['stop looking for it', 'ask his friends for help', 'be patient', 'write a letter']",His father told him to  _  .,"Matt's hobby was collecting stamps. He had stamps from many countries, like America, Egypt and China. On his birthday, can you guess what people gave him? That's right----stamps.
Matt's favorite stamps came from France. He had almost every stamp from 1954 to 2003 except one. That was a 1974 special edition  . It was very hard to find.
He looked for it everywhere. He asked his friends and relatives to help him. But nobody could find the stamp. It made Matt very sad.
""Don't worry,"" his father said to him. ""You'll find it one day.""
""I hope so,"" Matt said.
""Be patient  ,""his father said. ""Don't give up.""
Besides collecting stamps, Matt liked writing. He had a pen friend in France. They wrote to each other every month. Matt's pen friend, Philip, gave him a big, green stamp. It looked old. When Matt received the letter, he was very surprised. On the envelope, he looked closely at the stamp. It was the 1974 special edition stamp. Matt was so happy! He told his sister, his mother and his father.
""You see,"" his father said, ""You did find your stamp. So, you see, it's good to have two things in life.""
""What are they?"" Matt asked.
""Friends and patience  ."" he answered.",middle293.txt
