2,B,"['He would phone the police about the missing of his wallet.', 'He wondered if he had dropped his wallet while eating.', 'The head of the restaurant wanted to know what was wrong.', 'Several people were sitting at the table at that time.']",Why do you think the writer turned and walked back to the table?,"I don't often lose things and I'm always careful with money, so I was quite surprised when I reached for my wallet and it wasn't there. At first, I thought it was possible that I could have left it at home. Then I remembered taking it out to pay the taxi, so I knew I had it with me just before I walked into the restaurant. I wondered if it was possible that it could have dropped out of my pocket while I was eating dinner. I turned and walked back to the table where I had been sitting. Unluckily, there were several people sitting at the table at that time, so I had the waiter go over to the table to see if my wallet was on the floor. While the waiter was looking for it, the head of the restaurant came up to me and asked me if anything was wrong. I told him what had happened. He asked me to report the missing wallet to the police. I told him I didn't want to do so; I was in a hurry because I had to reach my waiting room before two o'clock, where some people were waiting to see me. I also told him that my biggest worry at the moment was how I was going to pay for the meal. He told me not to worry about that. He asked me to write down my name and address, and he said he would send me a bill  .",high11809.txt
