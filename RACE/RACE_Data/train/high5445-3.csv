3,A,"['Kids carry out experiments for the ISS.', 'Winners of competitions travel to the ISS.', 'Astronauts do activities together with students', 'Interlake School Division trains students to be astronauts.']",What's the main idea of the text?,"Kids at the Interlake School Division were the first Canadian students to take part in a program to send experiments to the International Space Station.(ISS).
Jordan Schott and three other sixth grade students came up with the idea to test royal jelly  in space . Their experiment came very close to be tested on the space station. ""We were seeing if we could send it to space, and if it would lose its nutritional value"" faster and or slower, ""said Schott. Schott is one of the 18 students in the Space Knights Club at Woodlands Elementary School, part of the Interlake School Division. Over 450 students from the Division took part in the program.
""I thought we were just students and we couldn't do much in the way of that. It's a way to communicate with people up there ,"" said Braeden Clark, a seventh grade student who is also in the club.
The astronauts shared what they learned with their school with a full day of activities all about science and space.
Teacher Maria Nickel is the organizer of the club. She said the day was great for students to learn what they could do. ""Space is one of those great things that get kids excited, but it also gives them the chance to do so much. They can be an astronaut; they can be an engineer, ""She said.
The day was held in honour of Chris Hadfield, a Canadian astronaut now in the Internal Space Station. ""It gives kids someone more to look up to. Here's a real hero to look up to who's doing it all, doing it through education,"" said Nickel.
Jordan Schott thinks it's really cool. ""To me it seems so cool how people can go up to space, and science is something I've always liked,"" She said. Schott says she wants to follow in the footsteps of Hadfield and be an astronaut when she gets older.
One of the winning experiments in the competition was produced by students from Argyle, Manitoba. It will travel to the space station in the fall of 2013.",high5445.txt
