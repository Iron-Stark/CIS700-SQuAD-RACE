""Oh no, it is true,"" the little bug said. ""All the stalks   will be knocked down, and the corn will be gathered up. You will be killed by the giant machines if you stay here.""
""I don't believe you,"" the spider said as she ate the little bug for lunch.
A few days later, the spider was laughing about the story the little bug had told her. She thought to herself: ""A harvest! What a silly idea. I have lived here all of my life, and nothing has ever disturbed   me.""
The next day was a beautiful sunny day. The sky above was clear, and there was no wind at all. That afternoon, as the spider was about to take a nap  , she noticed some thick dusty clouds moving towards her. She could hear the noise of a great engine  , and she said to herself: ""I wonder what that could be?""",middle5056.txt
