For example, how to go to school is a problem I often worry about. Every afternoon, my father picks me up at the gate of the school. Many parents pick up their children, too.  Most of them drive private cars. Of all the cars, Anna's father's car is the best. Anna seems to have a very rich father. She always has beautiful dresses, shoes and bags.

""Oh, I know that girl. She has no friends and is unhappy because she was born deaf. I'm sure that she didn't hear you. ""
