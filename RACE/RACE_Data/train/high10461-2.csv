To get the most from all you do, you must be in control of your time. Otherwise decision that affect how well you play the game, what position you play and when you get to play will be decided for you. Your success in high school depends on your use of time. Here are some important things to remember.
*Begin each term by filling in a master plan. First fill in things you must do (classes, work, practice, etc. that you can't change.) Then find the most effective use for these times.
*Set a regular time and place for study. This will save your time in the long run. If you have a study hall in your school, use it!
*Use daylight hours to study whenever possible. For most people for every hour of study done in daylight hours, it will take them one and a half hours to do the same task at night.
*Take breaks. Don't plan marathon study time. Have a short rest before you study again.
*By using flash cards or summary sheets, you can use odd times to study while you're waiting for class to start or for a friend to pick you up.
*If possible, plan study time with a partner. Choose your partner wisely however. Make sure you study, not socialize.
*Do the most difficult tasks for times when you are active. (For example, when you're energetic, it will become easier to solve maths questions; when you're tired, it will be impossible!)
*Make a daily checklist. Do the most important tasks first.",high10461.txt
