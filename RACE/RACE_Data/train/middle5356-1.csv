I'm very happy you'll come to my city at 3:00 pm this Sunday. Now let me tell you the way to Haitian Restaurant .Take a taxi from the airport and go down Renmin Road. Go across the big bridge. When you see a bank, turn right and go straight. It's down Songshan Road on the left. It's across from a big supermarket. I'll meet you there.
Have a good trip!
