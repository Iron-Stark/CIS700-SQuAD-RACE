1,C,"['look after the birds more often', 'use the binoculars to catch the birds', 'hide ourselves to make the birds do everything as usual', 'catch the birds at last']","When we're watching birds, we have to   _  .","If we find a bird nest  , we will have a good place of watching and knowing about birds. Birds sit on eggs and take care of their babies from April to June. Because the baby birds are too young to leave the nest, parents often go to look for food and come back in several minutes. So it is good to watch birds. When we watch birds, we'd better hide ourselves in a close place to the nest, and it's better to use binoculars  .
But how do we make a bird nest? A good bird nest must be very fine, strong, thick and comfortable. If you want to make one, please follow these:
a) Each nest must have six boards   for its cover and floor, for its left and right sides, and for its front and back sides. Don't make the boards too slippery  .
b) Dig a small hole in the front of the nest as a ""door"". The ""door"" is big enough so birds can fly in or out easily.
c) Make sure the rainwater can't go into the nest.
d) One piece of the board should be easy to open.
e) Don't forget to colour the nest.",middle1698.txt
