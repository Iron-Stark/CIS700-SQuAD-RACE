2,A,"['A wheelchair user may feel offended when you do not address him or her directly.', 'Assistants in big stores are usually kind to people in wheelchairs.', 'People in wheelchairs should fight for fair treatment.', 'People in wheelchairs are usually hard to get along with.']",What can we conclude from the article?,"After spending three days in a wheelchair, I was ready to quit. Not only did I have to battle cracked and uneven pavements, I had to deal with the bad attitude of pedestrians and a cold rain. But I didn't give up because of people like Tiffany Payne.
    Payne, who has been using a wheelchair for 18 years, laughed at me,

    Those of us fortunate enough to get around on our own two legs don't give a second thought to the person in a wheelchair next to us at a crosswalk. That would require us to look down.

    Some salespeople talked to me as though I were a child or acted like they didn't want to be bothered with me.
    People who use wheelchairs want to be treated like everyone else. They also comprehend, so you don't have to speak to them in a childlike, sing-song voice. It's not very appealing, especially when the person is an adult. And most importantly, remember they have feelings that can be hurt just like yours.
    Spending three days in a wheelchair made me look differently at those who have to use one. I hope you do the same.",high21981.txt
