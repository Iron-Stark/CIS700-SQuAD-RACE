The strong influence of American and English culture helps young people to learn the English language. They often become familiar with it through ""Harry Potter"" books or Disney movies. English schools, where Italian children are taught all their lessons in English, are also becoming popular among rich Italians.

Languages are very important in France. A good knowledge of the English language is necessary for many Frenchmen to get a good job and the more languages you can learn, the better. English is the first language you learn in school and you start very young. Most people have at least eight years of learning English at school. Learning German or Spanish comes next and Latin is also taught in most schools. While French people learn languages, there is also a movement to protect the French language.
