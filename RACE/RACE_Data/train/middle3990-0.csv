0,C,"['on the table', 'behind the door', 'on the floor', 'beside the furniture']",Where should we drop to protect our head and neck with our arms?,"An earthquake may happen at any time. It's best for us to know what to do, where to safe and who to _ during the earthquake. The following information will help you.
Remember: Prepare your personal earthquake bag. Collect these items and keep them somewhere near you. Water, food, medicine, mobile, phone, torch ,personal washing things, blanket, money.
Remember: Drop, Hide, Hold and contact. Drop to the floor and protect your head and neck with your arms. Hide yourself beside something like a table, a bed and so on. Hold the furniture so that you won't move away during the earthquake. Contact family friends to tell them where you are.
Remember: Never do these things. Stand to the close to the buildings stand under the trees or signs because it's better for you to stand in an open space. Go too close to the power lines  because you may be badly hurt by electricity.
