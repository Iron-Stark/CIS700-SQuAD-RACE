Introduction of Acrobatic Show:
This is the entertainment that should not be missed by the young and old on a visit to Beijing. You can see breath-holding acrobatics, some of which can be so demanding in the balance skill as to be close to the impossible.
This time you can see the bicycling show-- ten cycling girls all ending up on a bicycle with their fans spread out like a peacock. There are also girls bending and folding their bodies to a position where the feet hold the face and the head and hands are still balancing some glasses. Other exciting acts are the martial arts  , balancing of bowls, rope walking, pole climbing, roller skating and plate swirling  , etc.
