0,A,"['Get information from the Internet.', 'Read the Public Library Manifesto.', 'Clean the library with workers.', 'Work together with the teachers.']",What can students do in the school library?,"Our school library offers learning services, books and other things that help all members of the school to become good thinkers and clever users of information. It is linked   to the larger library in the city and the World Wide Web. All these services are given according to the requirements of the Public Library Manifesto  .
School library services must be given to all members of the school. Students of any age, class and grade can enjoy them. Different services must be given to those who are unable to use the main library services.
Users of the library must follow the rules made by the library workers to keep it clean and tidy. The main rules are as follows:
1. Opening and closing times:
Monday --Friday: 9 a.m. --9 p.m. during term time.
Saturday: 9 a.m. --1p.m. throughout the year.
2. Admission   and borrowing:
Only people holding a library card shall be allowed in.
Members can borrow 5 books at a time.
3. Behavior in the library:
Silence shall be kept as much as possible in the library. No other books can be taken into the library. Library workers can help members use the books and other things in the library.
When the library workers and teachers work together, students will get better reading, writing, and problem-solving skills.",high15193.txt
