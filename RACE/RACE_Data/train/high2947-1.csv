Two men in a boat came to his house and offered to take him to safety. ""No, thank you,"" said the man, ""God will help me.""
As the waters rose, the man retreated   to the second floor of his house. Now, two men in a motorboat came by and offered to rescue him. Again, the man refused, saying, ""No, thank you. God will help me. ""
As the waters rose still higher, the man retreated again to the rooftop of his house. A plane came by, and someone inside it threw down a rope, urging   the man to grab   it and be pulled up into the airplane. Once more, the man declined and said, ""No, thank you. God will help me. "" Just then a powerful voice called out to the man, ""You idiot! I sent you a boat, a motorboat and now a plane. What more do you want me to do?""",high2947.txt
