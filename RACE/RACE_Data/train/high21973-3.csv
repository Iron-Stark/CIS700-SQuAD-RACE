When I entered the university, I began to keep a diary. I can find the first day in the university was filled with excitement and also sadness.
    As I was afraid that parents were worried about me,I pretended to be OK in front of them.But after saying Goodbye,I turned my back,tears falling down.Then I entered the new dormitory,feeling a little sad.I still remember, the first night was terrible! The following days were better, and I started to taste the freedom and happiness with a lot of friends all day.And the everyday diary was full of joy! I recorded almost everything happened during the days.I even recorded what I had eaten.For me, all was interesting.
    So far, I have recorded about 220 diaries.The diary is just like a treasure.Many years later, when I open the diary, I am opening the door of memory, going back to those good old days.However,  _ One of my friends ever said to me,""I don't keep a diary. I prefer to put things aside in my mind. Only those time--tested are worth remembering forever,And as for the rest to be forgotten,just let them go...""Maybe,he is right.I think everyone has his own way to remember some special things.No matter what you sort to,the important key is to preserve the time of your life forever.Some day,when you date back to it,you'll remember the past.",high21973.txt
