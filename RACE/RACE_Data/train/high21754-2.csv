Kim . Have a seat , please ."" said Bill Williams , the manager . This was Kim's first experience with an assessment . After only six months he was due for a raise if this assessment was satisfactory 
""Kim,"" began Bill Williams . ""I am very pleased with the quality of your work . I have nothing but praise for your devotion and your hard work . My only concern is that you are not active enough in putting forward your suggestions .""
""But."" Replied Kim. ""I have always completed every assignment you have given me . Mr. Williams.""
""I know that , Kim . And please, call me Bill .But what I expect is for you to think independently and introduce new ideas . I need more input from you --more feedback on how things are going I don't need a ""yes man"". You never tell me what you think . You just smile as though everything is fine .""
""But,"" said Kim,"" "" I feel that since you are my superior , it would he presumptuous of me to tell you what to do .""
""I'm not asking you to tell me what to do, but what you think we could do .To make suggestions . I employed you because I respect your experience in this field, but you are not communicating your thoughts to me .""
""Yes . I see I'm not accustomed to this , but I will try to do as you say ..., Bill""
""Good, then , I expect to hear more from you at staff meetings or at any other time you want to discuss an idea with me .""
""Yes , of course . Thank you Mr. Will...Bill .""",high21754.txt
