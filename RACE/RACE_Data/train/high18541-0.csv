0,D,"['. believe in herself .', 'meet any difficulties', 'want to cross the dessert', 'worry about the journey to the ocean']","Before the stream reached the desert, she didn't   _   .","A little stream ran down from a high mountain far, far away through many villages and forests, until it reached a desert .The stream then thought, ""I've been through countless difficulties. I should have no problem crossing this desert! But as she started her journey, she found herself slowly disappearing into the sand. After many tries, she still failed add was very unhappy ""Maybe I can't reach the ocean in the end,"" she said sadly to herself,
    At this lime, a deep voice came, ""If a breeze can cross the desert, so can a river ."" It was the voice of the desert. But the little stream replied, ""That's because a breeze can fly, but I cannot.""
    ""That's because you can't give up what you are. If you like to do it, and left yourself evaporate into the breeze, it can take you across, and you can reach the ocean .""said the desert,                                                               
    ""Give up what I am now and disappear into the breeze? No !No !""The little stream could not accept this idea. After all, she had never experienced anything like it before.
    ""The breeze can carry the vapor across the desert and let it leave as rain. The rain will form a river again to continue its course,"" explained the desert very patiently.
     ""And whether you're a river or vapor, your nature never changes ,""continued the desert.  
     Hearing this, the little stream rushed into the open arms of the breeze , while carried her to the next stage of her life.                                       
     The course of our lives is like the experience of the little stream. If you want to  overcome  the difficulties in your life to head for the success ,you should also change the way you used to be.",high18541.txt
