1,D,"['tell people to walk slowly', 'encourage people to enjoy pleasant things', 'advise people to adjust to modern lifestyle', 'remind people to live and work at a natural pace']",World Slow Day is intended to  _  .,"Italians were reminded to slow down and relax on World Slow Day, an annual event celebrating life's simple pleasures.
""Let's take this day to stop and think about all the things we miss while we're rushing through our lives,"" said Bruno Contigiani, the President of the Art of Living Slowly Association. Contigiani, 62, a one-time high-powered manager, is now an ambassador for the slow life movement around the world. He started the first World Slow Day in 2007 to encourage the values of living and working at a more natural pace, and to make people rethink their daily lifestyle.
Contigiani's association suggests ""14 commandments   "" for living better, such as waking up five minutes earlier to enjoy breakfast without rushing. Others include walking whenever possible, and reading in the evenings instead of watching television.
This year, Contigiani left Italy where the event has spread around the country for Shanghai, one of the fastest moving cities in the world. The slow-living supporter said he wandered around the busiest streets of the commercial center for an entire afternoon, inviting people to ""slow down"". ""Among the '14 commandments', the one about waking up five minutes earlier was the most popular by far, "" Contigiani said.
Back in Italy, the now well-known event hosts a lot of activities, such as reminding people to stop and smell the roses. In central Milan you would probably be fined if you walk too fast. In parks and public spaces, free yoga and Tai Chi   lessons are important parts of the events.
Italian farmers' union noted that Italians spent less and less time preparing meals, a habit connected to rising levels of obesity . Therefore, the group said World Slow Day was a good opportunity to remind Italians to take extra time at meals in particular.
World Slow Day is by now an international event. A total of 90 ""Slow Cities"" in 11 countries inspired by the ""live well"" philosophy are supporting the day.",high8054.txt
