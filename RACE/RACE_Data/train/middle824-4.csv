He teaches P.E. in a middle school. He has a long beard  and takes care of it.
It was Sunday yesterday. There was a big football match of the year on the playground in the centre of the city. Mr. King likes the games very much and of course he was going to watch it. With his friends' help he got a ticket a few days ago. After breakfast he hurried to the bus stop, but a lot of people were waiting there. A bus came. There were lots of people on it and it was difficult for them to put their feet. He had to grip the back of the chair. At the next stop a boy got on the bus. He was short and couldn't grip anything. Suddenly the bus stopped and the boy was likely to fall off. He looked around and saw Mr. King's beard and gripped it. The man found it at once and called out,""Go off my beard, boy!""
