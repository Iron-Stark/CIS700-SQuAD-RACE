The unusual name stands out especially in Mandarin, which has no alphabet   and instead uses tens of thousands of multistroke   characters to represent words. ""The whole world uses it to write emails, and translated into Chinese it means 'love him',"" the father explained, according to the deputy chief of the State Language Commission Li Yuming.
While the @ symbol is familiar to Chinese email users, they often use the English word ""at"" to sound it out. With a drawnout ""t"", this sounds something like ""ai ta"", or ""love him"", to Mandarin speakers. Li says the name is an extreme example of people's increasingly adventurous approach to Mandarin, as commercialization and the Internet break down conventions  .
