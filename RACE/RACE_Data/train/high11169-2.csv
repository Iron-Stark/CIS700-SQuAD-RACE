2,B,"['Danny likes playing hockey with his father.', ""Ms. St. Onge is grateful for Danny's premonition."", 'Danny loves animals especially dogs very much.', 'Ms. St. Onge is an old woman who lives alone.']",Which of the following is TRUE?,"A ten-year-old boy from Howell, Michigan America is being hailed (...) a hero due to his persistence   that led to saving the life of an elderly neighbor. The chain of events unfolded late in the evening on Sunday, January 26th, 2014 when Danny Dipietro was being driven home from hockey practice by his dad.
That's when the young boy noticed an open garage and a figure that he believed was a dog outside an apartment near his house. Given the extremely cold weather, the young boy got a feeling that something was not right. But instead of dismissing   it like most kids at his age would have, he insisted that his mother, Dawn, go to examine what was going on. Dawn tried to convince   Danny that no one would leave a dog out in such cold weather, but he refused to take no for an answer.
Dawn finally gave in and decided to take a walk to the area with the family dog and see if there was any truth to Danny's premonition  . Sure enough, as she got closer to the apartment she noticed a garage that was wide open and a bent figure, waving madly. Upon getting there, she realized that it was not a dog that the young boy had seen, but Kathleen St. Onge, one of her neighbors. The 80-year-old had slipped on some ice in her garage and had been lying there for two hours, unable to get up.
Dawn rushed home to get her husband for help and called 911. The two then returned with some blankets to cover Ms. St. Onge, while they waited for the ambulance to arrive. Though still in hospital, the elderly woman is recovering well and grateful to Danny for his premonition.",high11169.txt
