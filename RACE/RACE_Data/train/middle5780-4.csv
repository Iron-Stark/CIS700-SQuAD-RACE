4,C,"['We should plant more trees for the people after us.', ""It's never too old to plant trees ."", 'We should do something useful for the people after us.', 'We should be friendly to others.']",What can we learn from the article?,"A rich man was riding along the road and saw an old man digging in his garden. On the ground lay a young tree, ready to be planted. The rich man called out to the old man. ""What kind of tree are you planting there, my good man?""
""This is a fig  tree, sir."" He said. ""A fig tree?"" The rich man was very surprised. ""Why, how old are you, may I ask?"" ""I am ninety years old this year."" ""What ?"" cried the man. ""You are ninety years old. You are planting a very young tree now and it will take years to give fruit. You certainly don't hope to live long enough to get any fruit from this tree."" The old man looked around the garden. Then he said with a smile, ""Tell me , sir. Did you eat figs when you were a boy?"" ""Sure , why do you ask this question?"" the man asked. ""Then tell me this,""he said. ""Who planted the fig tree?"" ""Why-why? I don't know."" ""You see, sir. Our forefather planted trees for us to enjoy and I am doing the same for the people after me.""
The rich man was quiet and said, ""You are right, my good man. We should do something for the people after us. Thank you very much."" The rich man rode away.",middle5780.txt
