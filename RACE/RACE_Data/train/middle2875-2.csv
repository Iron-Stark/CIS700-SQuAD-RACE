The ""Big Lottery "" is giving money to a group of teenagers who want to become active citizens. We're looking for young people to take part in projects near to where they live.
Here are a few easy things you could do to get started:
Meeting the neighbors
Everybody needs good neighbors. Knock on people's doors and find out what they would like to improve in your area. If you don't want to go round to their houses, then you could always put a note through their doors.
Neighborhood watch
Neighborhood watch plans are very popular in the UK. If you go away on holiday and leave your house, it's very nice to know that a neighbor is keeping an eye on it. It's a good way to make the area you live in safe.
Lending a hand

So, go on...Just tell us what kind of project you want to become involved in, then we'll send you more details. Take active action and help make your neighborhood a better place to live in.",middle2875.txt
