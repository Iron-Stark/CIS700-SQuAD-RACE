The man followed alone and felt very sad,but the woman kept on ahead and never looked behind,until the Creator,took pity on him and asked him if he was still angry with his wife.He said he was not,and the Creator then asked him if he would like to have her back again.He answered yes.
So the Creator created a patch  of the finest ripe   tomatoes along the way in front of the woman,but she passed by like seeing nothing at all.Later,he put a patch of beautiful flowers but again she refused to notice.Until suddenly she saw in front of her a patch of large ripe strawberries.They looked delicious.
She stopped to pick a few to eat,and as she ate them she turned her face to the west by accident,and at once she remembered her husband and she found herself unable to go on.She sat down,but the longer she waited,the more she missed her husband,and at last she took a lot of the best strawberries and started back along the way to give them to him.He met her kindly and they went home together.",middle7074.txt
