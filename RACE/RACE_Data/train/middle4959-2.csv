2,B,"[""People aren't able to control their emotions better."", 'It takes them less time to think about bad experiences.', 'People become less thankful for what they have.', 'Women feel sadder, more stressed and worried than men.']",Why does happiness increase with age?,"Are people less happy or happier when they get older? If your answer is""happier"", then you are right,based on a study published seven years ago.It found that people become happier and experience less worry after age fifty.In fact,it found that by the age of eighty-five,people are happier with their life than they were at eighteen.
The finding came from a Gallup survey of more than three hundred and forty thousand adults in the United States in 2008.At that time,people were between the ages of eighteen and eighty-five.
Arthur Stone in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at Stony Brook University in New York led the study.His team found that levels of stress were the highest among adults between the ages of twenty-two and twenty-five.Stress levels dropped sharply after people reached their fifties.
Levels of happiness were the highest among the kids and those in their early seventies.
The survey also found that men and women have similar emotional patterns as they grow older.However, women at all ages reported more sadness,stress and worry than men did.
So why would happiness increase with age? One theory is that,as people get older, they become more thankful for what they have and have better control of their emotions.They also spend less time thinking about bad experiences.",middle4959.txt
