1,D,"['Four.', 'Five.', 'Six.', 'Seven.']",How many colors do rainbow lorikeets have?,"The rainbow lorikeet   is a kind of parrot in the northeast of Australia. It is the most colorful and noisy bird in the world. The bird has green, orange, blue, red, yellow, purple and grey colors on its body.
Rainbow lorikeets are small birds. They are usually 11 to 12 inches long and weigh 120g to 140g. It is said that they can live for over 20 years in the wild.
They usually live in groups. At night, they sleep in the trees in a big group. But during the daytime, they move in much smaller groups (about 20 birds). Late in the evening, you can sometimes see a larger group flying back home.
These birds spend a lot of time looking for food. Most of their food comes from trees, like flowers, nuts and fruit. But sometimes they eat insects. They can get water from the leaves that they eat or drink water directly.
Rainbow lorikeets usually start to have families when they are around two years old. When they have baby birds, both the parents help to feed them.",middle7132.txt
