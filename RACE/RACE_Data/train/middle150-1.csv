1,D,"['Computers Will Do Everything For Man', 'Computers Are The Future', 'How Computers Change Our Habits', 'Will Computers Replace Shops And Books']","The title  for this passage is ""  _  ""","Computers are very important to modern life. Many people think that in the future computers will be used a lot in everyday's life. It is thought that we won't have to go shopping because we will be able to get most things which are sold in shops on the Internet. There will be fewer books because we will be able to get all texts from computers. The Internet will be used to play games, see films and buy food. Most telephone calls will be made by computers, too.
Some people are glad about these new ways of shopping and communicating . Others do not think that computers will replace  our old ways.
Let's take books for example. Some people think that one day we won't read books made of paper. Instead, we will buy and read books using computers. We will read texts on small pocket computers. The computers will keep many different books in them at the same time. We won't need to turn lots of pages and paper will be saved. Computerized books will be used more and more.
Is Internet shopping such a pleasure as going to the shop? Many people say it is not. It is a pleasure to go into shops and look at things you want to buy. It is also unlikely  that many people will want to read large texts on our computers. Because paper books will perhaps be more friendly. Maybe computers won't change these two habits .",middle150.txt
