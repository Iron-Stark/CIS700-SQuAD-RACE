3,B,"['My Own Travel in the US', 'My Studying in the US', 'My Opinion about the US', 'My Friends in the US']",Which is the best title for the passage ?,"You want to know about my staying in America, right? Well, to tell you the truth,it is really an eye-opening experience to study here.
In China, I had English classes five times a week since fifth grade. However, I didn't know how different textbook English could be from everyday English until I came to Hotchkiss School, Connecticut.
When I first studied English, I was told to say,""I am fine"" when people say ""How are you?"" But in the US, I found that people say, ""I am good"" or ""I'm tired"".
One day, someone greeted me with ""What's up?"" It made me  _ . I thought for a moment and then smiled because I didn't know what to say.
Since then, I have discovered more and more differences between Chinese and US cultures.
To my surprise, US girls spend a lot of time in the burning sun to get a tan . However, in China, girls try every possible way to get their skin paler, or ""whiter"".
I was also surprised by how hardworking US students are . In China, schoolwork is almost everything, so we study hard and that's it. But here, a ""good"" student gets good grades, does a lot of work for the public and plays sports or music.
The kids here are so talented, I am starting to be sorry that I gave up playing the piano at an early age and that I have never thought about sports.",high20793.txt
