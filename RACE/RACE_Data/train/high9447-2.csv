2,B,"['confused', 'hopeful', 'unhappy', 'curious']",The writer feels   _  about his life.,"When people ask me what Down Syndrome  is, I tell them it's an extra chromosome . A doctor would tell you the extra chromosome causes an intellectual disability that makes it harder for me to learn things.
Even though I have Down Syndrome, my life is a lot like yours. I read books and watch TV. I listen to music with my friends. I'm on the swim team and in chorus at school. I think about the future, and I like the one who I'll marry. And I get along with my sisters---except when they take CDs without asking! I'm a hard worker, a good person, and I care about my friends.
Some of my classes are with typical kids, and some are with kids with learning disabilities. I have an aid who goes with me to my harder classes, like math and biology. She helps me take notes and gives me tips on how I should study for tests. It really helps, but I also challenge myself to do well. For instance, my goal was to be in a typical English class by 12thgrade. That's exactly what happened this year!
It's true that I don't learn some things as fast as other people do. But that won't stop me from trying. I just know that if I work really hard and by myself I can do almost anything.
I can't change the fact that I have Down Syndrome, but one thing I would change is what people think of me. I'd tell them, ""Judge me as a whole person, not just the person you see. Treat me with respect, and accept me for who I am. The most important---just be my friend.""",high9447.txt
