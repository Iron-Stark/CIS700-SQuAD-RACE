2,A,"['optimistic', 'embarrassed', 'nervous', 'unsure']","According to the passage, the author is   _   about their friendship.","I consider Lily to be my best friend because she is always very good to me. She's always with me in times of difficulties and she is always there waiting for me. When I have problems and feel empty and upset, she's always by my side to comfort me. 
We've been together for two years. I met her during our college days. She was my classmate, but I can tell that we were not so close at that time, maybe because we had our own friends and maybe our attention was always on them, so I didn't even notice her. Yet there were times that she was with me during my lunch break. That is why we slowly became close. We had our lunch together in the boarding house but sometimes not, probably because we had our own friends.
And when we took our break, we bought our favorite food together, but not that often since we didn't have enough money. Furthermore, we were together in the student union, which was nice for me to know her better. I can say that she is really a nice friend. She is the kind of person that is very approachable in times of emptiness.
She is a friend whom I can call every time I need help. Definitely, I am so glad that I have her. Currently, we are working together as freelance writers online. We both work as contractors   in oDesk. We are very happy with working together, and we are looking forward to earning some money so that we can go on vacation together. 
Friendships may not last. Friendships can lose importance and die gradually. However, I believe she will be a lifelong friend of mine.",high24256.txt
