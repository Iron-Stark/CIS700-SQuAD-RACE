The 25-year-old author described winning as an ""unbelievable feeling"". ""I didn't think my book would be on the shortlist and stood a chance of winning, and it's amazing to receive such an important award at the beginning of my writing career. Needless to say I am absolutely made up."" he said.
The novel, inspired by film noir , fantasy and a fascination with the dark side of the 19th century, is for children between the ages of nine and 12. It tells the story of a boy, Jonathan Stirling, who discovers a similar world filled with vampires and werewolves . This alternative reality has a clearly Victorian air, and is ruled by a descendant of Jack the Ripper. Soon hunters from the other side begin searching for Jonathan, who finds himself driven into their world.
Waterstone's head children's buyer, Wayne Winstone, thought highly of Becker's ""huge"" achievement. He said: ""Tom Becker's writing style attracts you in the same way that Darren Shan's does with his mix of adventure and the supernatural.
""I have a feeling that Tom has real potential and could be one of the big names in children's writing in the future.""
This year's shortlist also included Michael Broad's Jake Cake, Philip Caveney's Sebastian Darke and Siobhan Dowd's A Swift Pure Cry. Last year's prize was won by Julia Golding with The Diamond of Drury Lane.",high7371.txt
