2,D,"['careless', 'considerate', 'unbelievable', 'unreliable']",What does Mary think of the couple she helped?,"Dear Miss Manners,
Friends of mine lost their home in a house fire.It was terrible.Another friend set up a ""go fund me"" type page for friends and funnily to donate and help the couple.Many friends, including me, helped with money, meals, lamprey and their dog while 'they were getting back on their feet.
Last week, they sent thank-you notes.My roommate received one addressed to her and I did not  The notes were not in modularized; it was a printed one-size-fits-all message.My roommate realized I didn't receive a thank you, so she sent a private message to the couple just letting them know I had been left out.I didn't know she had done this until later.
The next day, I got a text message apologizing and saying that I had been left out because their friend who addressed the notes must have missed me!(Miss Manners, they didn't even address the notes themselves!)It was accompanied by a picture of the thank-you note, which was texted to me with- the message, ""Here is a thank you just for you. ""
I was a little annoyed.I helped them in their fume of need and didn't get a second thought.I have not responded to her text message.Is it fair of me to consider this friendship over? Should I tell her that I am upset, or should I accept that this rude thank you was better than nothing?",high11285.txt
