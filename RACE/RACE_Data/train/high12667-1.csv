1,C,"['a doorkeeper', 'a salesman', 'a prison guard', 'a manager']",A person with tattoos can probably work as   _  .,"Having a tattoo  can reduce your chance of getting a job, but it depends on where the tattoo is, what it expresses and if the job involves dealing with customers, new research says.
Dr Andrew R Timming told the British Sociological Association conference on work, employment and society in Warwick today that employers were likely to view tattoos negatively. Dr Timming of the school of Management at the University of St Andrews said he had spoken to 15 managers involved in hiring staff about their reaction to interview candidates with visible tattoos.
""Most respondents agreed that visible tattoos are a stigma,"" Dr Timming told the conference. One woman manager told him that ""they make a person look dirty."" Another male manager told him ""subconsciously that would stop me from employing them."" The managers were concerned about what their organisations' customers might think, said Dr Timming. ""Hiring managers realise that, ultimately, it does not matter what they think of tattoos -- what really matters, instead, is how customers might think of employees with visible tattoos.
Dr Timming said: ""The one qualification to this argument is there are certain industries in which tattoos may be a desirable characteristic in a job interview. For example, an HR manager at a prison noted that tattoos on guards can be 'something to talk about' and 'an in' that you need to make a connection with the prisoners.""
The negative attitude to tattoos did not extend to ones that could be easily covered by clothing. Dr Timming also found that in some of the organisations it was only certain types of tattoos that diminished the chances of getting a job at interview. One male manager told him: ""If it's gang culture-related you may have a different view about the tattoo than if it's just because it's a nice drawing of an animal that they've done on their arm.""",high12667.txt
