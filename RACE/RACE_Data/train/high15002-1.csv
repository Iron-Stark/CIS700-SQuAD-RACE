We need every one of you to develop your talents and your skills so that you can help us old folks solve our most difficult problems. If you quit on school--you're not just quitting on yourself, you're quitting on your country. No one's written your destiny for you, because you write your own destiny. You make your own future.

Your goal can be something as simple as doing all your homework, paying attention in class, or spending some time reading a book.
