3,B,"['It can help us to be a good player.', 'It can help us write well in the future.', 'It can help make us work better', 'It can make us watch more TV at home.']",What can reading do for us if we do much of it ?,"People like to read or listen to stories, especially children. After reading, some children wish to be writers some day. They want to write stories or books for people to read. That's good! It's good to write something for people to read! But they should know that they need to be good readers first before they are really good writers. They should read a lot of books. Instead of  watching TV and spending a lot of time playing games when they are free. There is more fun in reading. After you read some good books, you may want to look for more books to read. Before you decide to be a good writer, you should say to yourself. ""I must read more and more to become better and better at writing!""",middle6551.txt
