     As Griffith tried to remove the car,its headlights attracted the attention of a passerby,Jordan Ricks,a college student.He ran over.
     Ricks,22,tried to appear calm as he instructed Gdmth to remove the car.Both of them could now see the wheel between the rails and the uneven track bed.Ricks put his hands under the front fender  and gave it a push.It didn't move.
    He pushed it again with all his strength,Still,no movement. 
    From about 50 feet away,a group of students from the nearby university watched the scene.Ricks signaled to them,and five of the guys came over.
    He directed them to different sides of the car,and they all put their hands under the flame.
""One,two,three"" Ricks yelled.They all pushed.
    ""One,two,three!"" he yelled again.The car didn't move.
    At that moment,they felt the ground begin to shake.Then four dings  signaled an on coming train,apd the railroad gates dropped down.In the distance,an unclear line of light appeared,followed by the loud noise of a horn  .

     The train was just a few hundred feet away.In the last few seconds,Stackhouse grasped Griffith's arm and pulled her from the car.His friend,Frank DiPietrapaul,18,grasped her other arm,and the pair pulled Griffith aside.
     They watched as the train,crashed into the car,cutting it into half its original size and sending metal pieces flying.Griffith sat crying as the police arrived and sorted through the ruins--and wrote her a ticket for no attention to driving.Eventually,the students went home.
     A few days later,a reporter asked the young men and Griffith to reunite at a local coffee shop.There a tearful Griffith hugged her rescuers.""These boys are heroes,""she would later tell anyone who would listen.""They saved my life.""  
     Ricks feels only grateful for the outcone.""It was one of those moments,"" he says,""when we could have been gone together.It makes you think how precious life is.""",high21574.txt
