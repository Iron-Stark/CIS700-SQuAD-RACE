Reading and writing skills are needed by every child in every subject in every year of their school life and outside school. As parents, you can play an important role in improving your children's literacy   by practicing reading, writing, spelling and speaking with them outside school.
By listening, asking questions, giving information, and reading with your children outside school -- you can make a difference. Students who improve their reading and writing will increase their vocabulary and their ability to use English correctly.
Here's some advice on how to help your children to read, write and spell:
* reading aloud each night
* letting children take part in everyday conversations
* listening to your children read
* reading your children's writing
* using a dictionary
* encouraging your children to talk about funny things
* trying not to ask questions that require ""yes"" or ""no"" answers
* Practicing reading and writing by filling in forms, writing letters, sending cards or e-mails.
