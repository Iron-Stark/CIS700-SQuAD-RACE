0,A,"['Composer: a man of mystery', 'Practice makes good music', 'Relation between sleeping and music', 'Music: product of nature']",What would be the best title for the text?,"Most people want to know how things are made. They honestly admit, however, that they hardly know a thing when it comes to understanding how a piece of music is made. Where a composer begins, how he manages to keep going - in fact, how and when he learns his trade - all are covered in complete darkness. The composer, in short, is a man of mystery .
One of the first things the common man wants to know about is the part inspiration plays in a composer's work. He finds it difficult to believe that composers are not much interested in that question. Writing music is as natural for the composer as eating or sleeping for all. Music is something that the composer happens to have been born for.
The composer, therefore, does not say to himself: ""Do I feel inspired?"" He says to himself: ""Do I feel like working today?"" And if he feels like working, he does. It is more or less like saying to himself: ""Do I feel sleepy?"" If you feel sleepy, you go to sleep. If you don't feel sleepy, you stay up. If the composer doesn't feel like working, he doesn't work. It's as simple as that.",high3113.txt
