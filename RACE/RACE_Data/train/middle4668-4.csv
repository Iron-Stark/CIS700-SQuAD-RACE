4,B,"['5.', '6.', '8.', '10.']",How many wrong things did Lu do altogether?,"Last week Lu visited England. He stayed with my grandmother. He found it was strange.
'I don't know why, but I frightened your grandmother a lot. When I arrived, I gave her a purse from Dongtai. She looked in it and asked me to take it back. Then I saw a red spider   on the table, and I killed it for her. She seemed very unhappy. Do English people like spiders?
'Later we went shopping. Someone was painting a shop front, so there was a ladder. Grandmother stopped me from walking under it and said I must walk around it. I liked the shops and bought some lovely rose soap for my mother, a smart umbrella for my father and some new shoes for myself. When we got back, I put the shoes on the table and opened the umbrella to check if it was all right. Your grandmother came in and screamed!
'Then I broke a small mirror in the bathroom. Your grandmother's face went white. I felt very sorry. When I left, I gave your grandmother some flowers. She counted and there were 13. She didn't like them.'
I explained to Lu, 'My grandmother follows the old customs. You must not give someone an empty purse, or they will have no money. You must not kill a ""money spider"", or the same will happen. Also it is very unlucky to walk under a ladder or put new shoes on the table. An open umbrella in a house means someone will die. Breaking a mirror brings seven years' bad luck, and 13 is also a very unlucky number. You were really making my grandmother very afraid.'",middle4668.txt
