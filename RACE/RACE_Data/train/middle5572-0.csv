chores, but they hardly ever helped me do them.
A year ago, I made a game called ""The Endless Chore Game"".It's really great.Here's how the game works.
I made a card with forty squares ( ) and I write a different chore on each square.These chores can be easy and interesting like making dessert.Then my family roll the dice  to decide what chores we have to do.The card also has a few squares with fun things, like watching TV and singing.If you are lucky, you can watch TV when the others are doing the chores.
