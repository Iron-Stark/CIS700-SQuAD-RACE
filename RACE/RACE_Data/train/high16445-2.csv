2,C,"['Learning is the key to great success.', 'A person fails usually because of carelessness.', 'A more successful person sees more and further.', ""One's success is not related to his working hard.""]",What does the passage mostly want to tell us?,"John and Bobby joined the same company together just after graduation from college the same year. Both worked very hard. After several years, however, the boss promoted   Bobby to the position of manager but John remained an ordinary worker. John couldn't
it anymore, gave his resignation   to the boss and complained that the boss only promoted those who only said good words to him.
The boss knew John worked very hard for the years. He thought for a moment and said, ""I hope you will do one more thing for our company before you leave.""
John agreed.  The boss asked him to go and find anyone selling watermelons in the market. John went and returned soon. He said he had found a man selling water melons. The boss asked how much they per kilo. John shook his head and went back to the seller to ask and returned to tell the boss $1.2 per kilo.
The boss told John to wait a second, and he called Bobby to come to his office. He asked Bobby to go and find anyone selling watermelons in the market.  Bobby went, returned and said, ""Boss, only one person is selling watermelons.  $1.2 per kg, and $10 for 10 kg. He has 340 melons in all, 58 of which are on the table. Every melon weighs about 2 kg. Brought from the South two days ago, they are fresh and red. ""
John was impressed and realized the difference between himself and Bobby. He decided not to resign but to learn from Bobby.",high16445.txt
