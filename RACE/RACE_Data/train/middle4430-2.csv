2,A,"['Black.', 'Blue .', 'Brown.', 'White.']",What color is the old man's umbrella?,"It is a beautiful spring morning. There isn't a cloud, and the sun is warm but not too hot. So Mr. Green is surprised when he sees an old man at the bus stop with a big strong black umbrella in his hand.
Mr. Green says to him, ""Do you think we are going to have rain today?""
""No,"" says the old man,""I don't think so.""
""Then are you carrying the umbrella to keep the sun off you?"" ""No, the sun is not very hot in spring.""
Mr. Green looks at the big umbrella again, then the man says, ""I am an old man, and my legs are not very strong. So I really need a walking stick . When I carry a walking stick, people will say, ""Look at that poor man. "" And I don't like that. When I carry an umbrella in fine weather, people only say,""Look at that foolish man.
