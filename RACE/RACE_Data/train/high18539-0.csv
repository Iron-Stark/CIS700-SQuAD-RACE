0,B,"['expressed his astonishment', 'showed his anger to Mrs.Nugget', 'made children not practise the piano', 'was afraid that he would be troubled by any noise in the evenings']","In his letter, Mr.Barge  _  .","Dear Mrs.Nugget,
You may remember that we have discussed the noise your children make while practicing the piano.You agreed to make sure that they would stop practicing in the evenings.
You can imagine my astonishment , then, when I realized that nothing had changed and the situation was going on as before.I find it difficult to stay in the house and invent any excuse to go out for the evening to be away from the terrible noise.Though I like music very much, I have had enough, and to be honest, I am not prepared to put up with the situation any more.
I think it's high time that you realized your duty as a member of the community , and I must warn you that unless you do something about the situation I will be forced to take legal   action.
I have sent a copy of this letter to my lawyer.
                                                                Mr.Barge",high18539.txt
