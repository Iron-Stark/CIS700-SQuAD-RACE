2,D,"['Cats.', 'Dogs.', 'E-pets.', 'None of the above.']",What kind of pet will Simon keep?,"Daniel: Hi, Simon. How are you these days?
Simon: Not bad. But I just feel a little sad.
Daniel: What's wrong?
Simon: You see, I bought some goldfish last week. But now they all die.
Daniel: I'm afraid you forgot to change water for them.
Simon: No.  I just gave them a lot to eat. I think they like eating.
Daniel: Oh,I see. It's the food that killed your goldfish. You know goldfish can only remember things for 3 seconds.
Simon: So what?
Daniel: So they always forget they have already eaten food. They just keep eating if you feed them.
Simon: You mean my goldfish die of eating too much?
Daniel: That's right.
Simon: Oh,my poor goldfish.
Daniel: Don't be sad. Why not have a cat or a dog as your pet?
Simon: Oh, no. I don't like them. Cats and dogs always make much noise and they will make my room dirty. Besides that I should take good care of them.
Daniel: Well,why don't you try an e-pet?  It's modern and cute. And it's easy to look after because they don't need food and water. The most important thing is that you can control it freely.
Simon: That's good! I want to have an e-pet.
Daniel: That will cost you a lot of money.
Simon: Oh, my God! I think I will just have it in my dream.",middle7491.txt
