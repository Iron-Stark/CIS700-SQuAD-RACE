1,D,"['Its service was free.', 'It could show fantastic programs.', 'It included attractions of all kinds.', 'It could make families satisfied.']",What would a successful amusement park be like in Walt's opinion?,"Walt had a strong commercial sense of what would appeal to the public. Disneyland, Walt Disney World, and finally the other Disney theme parks around the world all came about because Walt Disney insisted that he could build an amusement park that was so much bigger and better than other amusement parks that it shouldn't even be called an amusement park.
In 1940 he disclosed a plan to show Disney characters in their fantasy surroundings at a park across the street from the Disney studio in Burbank.
The idea of an amusement park grew in Walt's mind as he traveled through the US and Europe and visited attractions of all kinds. Walt was sure that an amusement park would be successful in the United States if it offered a ""good show"" that families could enjoy together, was clean, and had friendly employees.
In 1948 he shared his concept with trusted friends, a modest amusement park with a central village including a town hall, a small park, railroad station movie theater, and small stores. Outlying areas would include a carnival   area and a western village. Soon he added spaceship and submarine rides, a steamboat, and exhibit halls.
Four years later, he decided on ""Disneyland"" for the name and formed a company to develop the park, Disneyland, Inc.
In 1953 he got Stanford Research Institute to examine the economic future of Disneyland and to find the perfect location.
They broke ground in July, 1954, and one year later, Disneyland opened. Within 7 weeks, a million visitors had visited Disneyland, making it one of the biggest tourist attractions in the US.
Walt combined his talent and his sense of what the public would want with lots of hard work. In 1960, with a mixture of huge successes and failures, Disney had created something that was successful beyond Walt's own dreams.",high14281.txt
