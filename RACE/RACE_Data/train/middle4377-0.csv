0,A,"['Jenny', 'Ben', 'Mr. Chen', 'Miss Jones']",_   is not at school this week.,"Dear Jenny,
I'm sorry you're sick and can't come to school this week. Let me tell you what you have on Monday next week.
We have math at 8:00. How boring! Then we have English. That's interesting. I know you love English. Next is P.E.. The fourth lesson is art. That's my favorite subject! In the afternoon, we have history with Mr. Chen. He is fun but history isn't.  Then at 2:00 we have science with Miss Jones. You know how strict she is. I don't like her. Our last class of the day is math.
Yours,
Ben",middle4377.txt
