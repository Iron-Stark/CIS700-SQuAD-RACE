0,C,"['they are asked to do something to save the environment', ""they can't drive to work any more"", 'they are required to turn to green living completely at once', 'they are made to pay for the pollution they cause']",Most people will be frightened if_.,"As global warming continues to be a major concern for the future of our planet,people are starting to turn to green living practices to help save it for future generations.Green living involves every aspect of our daily life from driving to work to mowing our lawns.
Making the switch to green living all at once might scare most people away from carrying out those earth-friendly changes.There are many ways to ease into this practice and still help save the earth's environment.
Air pollution is a major problem for some cities.A lot of it comes from the factories, but that's not the only way contributing to global warming.Automobiles give off a fair amount of pollutant into the air.When you have a lot of cars driving around on the city streets, you're multiplying the amounts of pollutant being emitted by each car that's destroying our ozone .If you want to save the environment,you can start by either car pooling,walking more instead of driving or even purchasing hybrid models that don't do as much damage.
Then let's take a look at your home.What kinds of bulbs are you using? The standard bulbs we use only contribute to higher electricity bills and more carbon dioxide.If you switch at least some of your standard bulbs with the compact fluorescent bulbs,you can save the environment while saving on your electric bill.
Recycling is also an excellent way to save our environment.Try to buy as many products as you can that can be recycled.The less trash that has to be burned or buried into our soil,the better off our planet will be.
These small changes may seem that they couldn't help much for the environment,but they can help tremendously.Every little bit we do is a much-needed step toward reserving natural resources for our future generations.",high17326.txt
