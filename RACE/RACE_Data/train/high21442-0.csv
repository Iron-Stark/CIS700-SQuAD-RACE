 One of the last West Coast homes of the Monarch butterfly,a type of insect ,may soon disappear.Strangely,it is in a town that calls itself Butterfly U.S.A,Pacific Grove, California.
 The  town  of Pacific Grove loves the butterflies.Every year they have a parade and hundreds of children dress up as butterflies.Monarch butterflies are the town  _ .Tourism is very important,and many people come to see the butterflies.The butterflies are good for the development of the town.
 In 1981 there were so many butterflies it looked like it was raining butterflies.Tens of thousands of Monarchs stayed on tree branches near Pacific Grove.Now there are not so many.
The building goes on a little bit at a time,and you don't notice it day by day.Over time,you can see that there has been a lot of development.As new buildings go up,many trees are cut down.
This reduces the natural homes for the butterflies.
Monarchs travel hundreds of miles each year,returning to the same woods,often to the same trees.The female Monarchs need milkweed to lay their eggs;the males will follow the females.
Millions of Monarchs have traveled regularly along the same path for thousands of years.They start their trip in the mountains of Mexico and travel to the middle part of America.If the woods where the butterflies live are destroyed,the whole species could be lost.There have been Monarch butterflies along the coast of California for as long as man can remember,but no one is sure how much longer they will last.",high21442.txt
