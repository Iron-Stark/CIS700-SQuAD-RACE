1,C,"[""He's opposed to the new school holiday."", 'Asian culture is valued most in New York.', 'Asian culture is part of the American society.', ""The holiday wipes out Asian Americans' isolation.""]",What do we know from Ron Kim's words?,"Mayor Bill de Blasio designated  the Lunar New Year an official public school holiday in New York City in June, 2015.
The move came after de Blasio in March, 2015 declared school holidays on the most-observed holiday in Islam, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. De Blasio, _ a promise made during his 2013 mayoral campaign, said students would also have a day off on the Lunar New Year, and not long ago the Asian holiday took place on February 8, 2016.
""About 15% of the city's school system is of Asian descent , and many student, have been taking the day off as a sick day"" said State Senator Daniel Squadron. ""It's a big deal,"" he said, whose district includes Manhattan's Chinatown. ""Families have had to choose between their most important cultural celebration and missing a day of school.""
The city's Department of Education had been working on the practical arrangements for adding another holiday while maintaining the legal 180 school days. The problem was solved by combining two half days that previously did not count towards the total to form a single full day that can be counted towards the total. After San Francisco, New York is the second major urban school district to add the Lunar New Year to the official school calendar.
""This holiday is not about kids just getting a day off from school,"" said Assemblyman Ron Kim. ""It's about the City of New York telling hundreds of Asian-American societies that America is a cultural melting pot."" Kim said recognizing the holiday is one way of pushing back against feelings of isolation and marginalization  felt by the Asian-American community.",high14292.txt
