0,B,"['fold and- unfold its wings', 'unfold wings for flying', 'land in the airport', 'meet flying safety regulations']",It takes the carplane one minute to  _  .,"If cars had wings, they could fly and that just might happen, beginning in 2012.The company Terrafugia, based in Woburn, Massachusetts, says it plans to deliver its carplane, the Transition, to customers by the end of 2012.
"" It's the next 'wow' vehicle,"" said Terrafugia vice president Richard Gersh.""Anybody can buy a Ferrari, but as we say, Ferraris don't fly.""
The car plane has wings that unfold for flying-a process the company says takes one minute-and fold back up for driving. A runway is still required to take off and land.
The Transition is being marketed more as a plane that drives than a car that flies, although it is  both.The company has been working with FAA to meet aircraft regulations, and with the National High way Traffic Safety Administration to meet vehicle safety regulations.
The company is aiming to sell the Transition to private pilots as a more convenient and cheaper way to fly.They say it saves you the trouble of trying to find another mode of transportation to get to and from airports: You drive the car to the airport and then you're good to go.When you land, you fold up the wings and hit the road.There are no expensive parking fees because you don't have to store it at an air port-you park it in the garage at home.
The carplane is designed to fly primarily under 10,000 feet.It has a maximum takeoff weight of 1,430 pounds, including fuel and passengers.Terrafugia says the Transition reduces the potential for an accident by allowing pilots to drive under bad weather instead of flying into marginal  conditions.
The Transition's price tag: $ 194,000.But there may be additional charges for options like a radio, transponder or GPS.Another option is a fullplane parachute.
""If you get into a very awful situation, it is the necessary safety option,""Gersh said.
So far, the company has more than 70 0rders with deposits. ""We're working very closely with them,
but there are still some remaining steps, "" Brown said.",high2430.txt
