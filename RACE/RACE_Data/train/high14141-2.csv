2,D,"['China decided to cut its military forces.', ""World leaders attended China's military parade."", 'China sowed its weapons to the world.', 'China held a military parade in Beijing.']",What is mainly talked about in the passage?,"President Xi Jinping announced Thursday that China will cut its military by 300,000 troops, a significant reduction in one of the largest militaries in the world and a move that the Chinese leader called a gesture of peace.
""The great renewal of the Chinese nation requires efforts of one generation after another,"" Xi said in a speech at Tiananmen Square remembering the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in the Pacific. ""Having created an impressive civilization of over 5,000 years, the Chinese civilization will lead to an even brighter future,"" he said.
Xi's announcement came as China staged a massive military parade in central Beijing, sending a stream of troops, tanks, and ballistic missiles  down a major east-west street as fighter jets flew overhead with multicolored smoke.
Xi's speech kicked off the parade. An estimated 12,000 troops--about 1,000 of whom hailed   from Belarus, Cuba, Tajikistan, and other countries-marched along the 10-lane Chang'an Avenue from the commercial center wangfujing to Tiannmen Square, about 1.5 miles away. They were joined by 200 fighter jets and 500 pieces of military hardware, including tanks and ballistic missiles. Representatives from 49 countries were in attendance, including Russian leader Vladimir Putin, South Korean President Park Geun-hye and U. N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.
Rory Medcalf, head of the national security college at Australian National University, said the Beijing may have decided to cut 300,000 troops ""in the name of efficiency and cost saving.""
Xi conducted a ""troop inspection"" after his speech, riding down Chan'gan Avenue in a Chinese-made Hongqi parade car. On Thursday morning, China's popular microblogging site Sina Weibo filled up with 350 million comments related to the parade. While many users expressed their love of their country and pride, few posts were filled with criticism. ""The soldiers are too serious,"" wrote one user. Others complained about the cloud of gray exhaust that followed a column of tanks.",high14141.txt
