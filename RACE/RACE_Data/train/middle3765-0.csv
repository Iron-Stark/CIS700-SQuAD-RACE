0,B,"['the name of a plane', 'the name of an airline', 'an air lab', 'a radio programme']",Bel Air is   _  .,"People travel a lot with Bel Air because they know they will get what they want.
They want to go quickly and safely across the country, across the sea or right across the world, and they know Bel Air will take them where they want to go, when they want to go. Bel Air flies all the newest and fastest planes to more towns and cities, in more countries of the world than any other airline.  
Do you want to go to Paris, Washington DC, Tokyo? Bel Air will take you there, at all times of the day and night, right through the week. But Bel Air flies not only to the biggest cities, in the rich counties---we fly two or three times a week to towns and cities in the centre of Asia, Africa and South America.
People who travel a lot fly with Bel Air, because they know they will leave on time and arrive on time. They know that they will receive the best food and watch the best films.
Bel Air is second to none. When you fly, fly with Bel Air.",middle3765.txt
