2,A,"['Using grocery bags more then once.', 'Remembering Earth Day every year.', 'Refusing water bottles.', 'Avoiding oil spill accidents.']",Which of the following is mentioned as a way of protecting the environment?  _,"Earth Day is day that is meat to inspire awareness for the Earth's natural environment. It is the day to highlight the fact that we all have a responsibility to the environment and need to change our behavior to improve the quality of our air, earth and water.
    Global awareness of the need to protect the environment has grown greatly since 20 million people in the United States marked the first Earth Day on April 22,1970.That was started at the time of the destruction caused by an oil spill along the coast of southern California, which killed marine life and about 10000 birds. The incident was a wake-up call for the need to protect the Earth. But similar disasters have continued to happen.
    Having one day to protect the Earth's resources is clearly more than necessary. However, efforts need to be made by individual of a country instead of just the government. Solving environmental problems is a personal responsibility.
    Some of us don't think that reusing grocery bags and recycling water bottles can help improve the quality of our air, land and water. But this is an easy place to start to make a difference when we celebrate Earth Day.
