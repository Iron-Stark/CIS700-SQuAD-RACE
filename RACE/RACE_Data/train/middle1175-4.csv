4,A,"['A Special Question', 'A Hard-working Cleaner', 'A Good Teacher', 'A Clever Student']",What's the title of the passage?,"Last summer, Mark became a middle school student. He took an English test in the first month. Mark was a good student and he worked hard. He finished the questions easily until he read the last one: ""Everyone sees our school's cleaner every day. What's her first name?"" Of course, this question is a little special. Mark saw the woman some times. She was tall and her hair was dark. But Mark didn't talk with her and didn't know her first name. The test was over. Then one student asked the teacher, ""Is the last question very important in this test?"" ""Yes,"" said the teacher. ""In our life, we meet many hard-working people. They are important. You should care about them. You should smile at them or say 'hello' to them."" Mark never forgot that question. He also learned that woman's first name. It was Kathy.",middle1175.txt
