3,D,"['The author came to the United States from another country.', 'The author had two children at least including one daughter.', ""What really changed the author's life was she believed in herself."", 'The author wrote that she was the person her son most admired.']",Which of the following is NOT true?,"I come to the United States ten year ago. I would always say that I was trying to study, but there were always things like work and my kids that would not allow me to start.
Now I realized that those were only excuses. What stopped me was that I was afraid to start studying again. I always believed I would learn by myself.
One day, however, my son told me that he was sad because his friends would come over and I didn't understand them because I didn't speak English. He was also sad because I could never help him with his homework. That same day, I told myself, ""Rocio, you have to start believing in yourself and you will see you can make it.""
The next day, I went downtown to look for a big banner   in front of the school which said that they offered classes for adults. I came in to see if I could join, but the classes were closed  already. That night I took the kids to the movies, and on the way back, I told them we would take a new route. I ended up getting lost. That's the way I found Chaffey College. The following Monday, I went to ask for information. They told me that summer school was starting that week.
That's how I started studying English last summer. It is difficult, but I have had great rewards. My daughter had to write a story for school. It was about the female they most admired and why . She wrote that I was the person she most admired because I had started going to College. I will never forget this.",high11134.txt
