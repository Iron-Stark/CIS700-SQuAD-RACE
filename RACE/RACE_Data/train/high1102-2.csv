2,A,"['the escalator is a public place', 'the man was very afraid of me', 'the ""sorry"" said to me was for everyone', ""there wasn't enough room to get my feet in""]",The man on whose feet I stepped apologized to me because   _   .,"There is one word that is on the lips of Americans , day and night , ""Sorry"".
One time as I was walking on the street , a young man ran by hurriedly , brushing against my handbag . Even as he continued on his way , he turned back and said ""sorry"" to me . Even in a rush , he didn't forget to apologize .
One day , after I bought some apples , the salesman was giving me the change , but I wasn't ready for it , and a coin dropped on the ground, ""I'm sorry ,"" he said while bending down to pick it up . I was puzzled --why would he apologize when it was my fault ?
Another time , I stepped on a man's foot in an escalator . At the same time , we both said ""sorry"" . I thought it interesting : was it really necessary for him apologize ?
Later on , an American friend explained to me that according to the American ideas, the escalator is public place which everyone should be able to stand in . After someone occupies a position in the escalator , making it difficult for someone else to find a place to stand in , isn't it necessary to express an apology ?
During my stay in America , I gradually realized that when friction   occurs in daily life , Americans don't care much about who is responsible . If someone is troubled , a ""sorry"" is always necessary . Even if the other person is hurt , the ""sorry"" would cool tempers . Perhaps this is why I never saw anyone quarreling on the buses , subways or streets in America .",high1102.txt
