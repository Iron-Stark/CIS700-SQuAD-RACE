Colin is a twenty-year-old young man. Two years ago, when he finished middle school, he got a job in a store. Usually he works until ten o'clock in the evening. He is very tired when he gets home. After a quick supper he goes to bed and soon falls asleep. His grandma who lives downstairs is satisfied  with him.
One day, on his way home, he met Nancy. They were both happy. He asked the girl to his house. She agreed happily. He bought some fruit and drinks for her. And they talked about the school life they spent together, their teachers, classmates and their future . They talked for a long time.
""Have a look at your watch, please,"" said the girl. ""What time is it now?""
""Sorry, something is wrong with my watch,"" said Colin. ""Where's yours?""
""I left it at home.""
Colin thought for a moment and found a way. He began to stamp his foot on the floor, ""Bang! Bang! Bang!""
The sound woke his grandma up. The old woman shouted downstairs, ""It's twelve o'clock in the night, Colin. Why are you still jumping upstairs?""",middle2044.txt
