1,A,"['People send messages to the gods by lighting or blowing out the candles.', 'The gods celebrate their birthdays by lighting candles.', 'The custom of lighting candles originated with the gods.', 'The gods will help people realize their dreams on their birthdays.']",Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?,"Thousands of years ago, birthdays were considered special days. On birthdays, the bad spirits were able to harm you and change your life. It was believed that the only way to solve the problem was to have your friends and family around you, so that good wishes and presents would keep the bad spirits away. Also, noisemakers were thought to be used at parties as a way of scaring away the evil spirits.
The custom of lighting candles was created by people believing that the gods lived in the sky. By lighting candles and torches, they were sending a signal or prayer to the gods, so they could be answered. Blowing out the candles and making a wish were thought to be another way of sending a signal or a message.
