2,A,"['The Little Boat That Sailed Through Time', 'The Little Boat And My Wife', 'The Little Boat That Sailed At Storvassdal', 'The Little Boat And My Parents']",What's the best titile of the passage?,"I will never forget the tenth summer of childhood with my grandfather in western Norway at the mountain farm where my mother was born. As a boy ,I always thought people simply bought whatever they need. Whether Grandfather knew this, I don't know. One day he said, ""Come, I have something for you.""
I followed him to a workroom. ""You should have a toy boat. You can sail it at Storvassdal."" He said. Great, I thought,looking around for the boat. But there was none.
Grandfather pointed to a block of wood. ""The boat is in there,"" he said. Then he handed me some tools and showed me how to use them properly. ""It'll be a fine boat,and you'll make it with your own hands,"" he said,""No one can give you what you do for yourself."" The words rang in my head as I worked. Finished the boat. It wasn't much to look at ,but I was poud. Then I sailed it at Storvassdal.
We had to return to America. ""You cannot bring that boat home with you,"" my mother said. We already had too much baggage. Feeling sad, I hid my boat under a big rock at Storvassdal.
I said good-bye to Grandfather, not knowing I would never see him again.
In 1964, I went to Storvassdal with my parents and my wife and children. To my surprise,for 34 years my treasure stayed here,waiting for my return. I felt _ were togethet again although my grandfather had died 22 years before.
I carved""1930""and""1964"" on its side and put it back.
I returned to the lake in 1968,1971,1977 and 1988. Each time I had the boat and carved the year,my grandfather seemed near.
My last trip to Storvassdal was in 1991. I brought my granddaughters: Catherine,13; Claire,12. I hoped they would understand the importance of the little boat and its simple message. At Storvassdal, Claire said softly, 'Grandpa,someday I'll come back.' She added,""And I'll bring my children.""",middle5518.txt
