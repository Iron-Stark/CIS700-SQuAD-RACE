1,A,"['To study if cigarette smoking can cause the cognitive deficits among alcoholics.', 'To show that smoking and drinking has much connection with IQ and thinking ability.', 'To show that smoking and drinking has little connection with IQ and thinking ability.', 'To prove that smoking has no connection with drinking.']",What's the purpose of the study that was carried out by Glass and her partners?,"The poorer mental function seen among alcoholics, many of whom also regularly smoke cigarettes, may be partly caused by the long-term effects of nicotine , new study suggests. 
""People who are also smokers are more dangerous,"" Dr. Jennifer M. Glass, of the University of Michigan's Addiction Research Center, said. In her study, ""cigarette smoking had bad effects on IQ and thinking,"" she said. This finding may seem wrong because many smokers feel better after smoking. 
Studies show that up to 87 percent of alcoholics smoke cigarettes. Yet, few studies have looked into cigarette smoking as a reason that might explain the cognitive deficits  reported among alcoholics. 
To find out that connection, Glass and her partners examined brain function among 172 men from the same community, including 103 men who  are alcoholics. The team found that heavy smokers and those alcoholics both had lower IQ scores. 
In the further study, the experts found that smoking also appeared to be connected with weaker verbal   and visual-spatial reasoning  . So, though smoking did not account for all of the poorer mental function among the alcoholics, it did seem to account for some of the effects, the report shows.",high23863.txt
