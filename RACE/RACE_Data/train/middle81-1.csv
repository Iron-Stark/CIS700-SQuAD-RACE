I  think   a  homestay   may  be   a  good   choice  for  you  if  it  is  your  first  time  to  visit  abroad .  The local  people  are  friendly  and  willing  to  help. If  you  happen  to  celebrate   the  holidays  with  them,  you  will  get  to  know  more  about    western  culture  and  customs.",middle81.txt
