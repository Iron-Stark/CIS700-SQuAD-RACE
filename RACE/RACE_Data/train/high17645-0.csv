0,C,"['Good habits', 'Bad habits', 'Both good habits and bad habits', 'Neither good habits nor bad habits']",are formed little by little.,"Habits,whether good or bad,are gradually formed when a person does a certain thing again.He is driven by some unseen force to do the same thing repeatedly, and then a habit is formed.Once a habit is formed,it is difficult,and sometimes impossible,to get rid of.It is therefore very important that we should pay great attention to the formation of habits.Children often form bad habits, some of which remain with them as long as they live older. Persons also form bad habits lasting as long as they live,and sometimes become ruined by them.
There are other habits which,when formed in early life,are of great help.Many successful men say that much of their success has something to do with certain habits in early life,such as early rising,honesty and so on.
Among the habits which children should not form are laziness,lying,stealing and so on.These habits are all easily formed.Unfortunately older persons often form habits which could have been avoided.
We should keep away from all these bad habits,and try to form such habits as will be good for
ourselves and others.",high17645.txt
