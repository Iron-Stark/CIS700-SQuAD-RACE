2,B,"['PS15.', 'PS65.', 'PS 30.', 'PS 60.']",How much should you pay for two lessons if you are outside Bristol and don't own a bike?,"We are now able to offer those adults who live, work or study in the Bristol City Council area cycle lessons for free up to 3 hours long.
Beginner? Can't you ride a bike? You're not alone. We can help you get on a bike and go cycling. Beginners are called Level 1.
Need a refresher? If you need a refresher or you haven't been on a bike for a while and want to start cycling or perhaps you're confident on traffic-free routes but you want to start cycling on the road, our instructors can teach you the skills you need to cycle safely and confidently on the road. This is Level 2.
Experienced Cyclist? If you are an experienced cyclist, our professional urban coaches can give you smart tips for negotiating complex junctions more easily and improving your rush-hour strategies. This is Level 3.
What you should bring: You will need a roadworthy bike for your lesson. If you don't own a bike you can hire one for the duration of your lesson but you can only hire one from the instructors at our Bedminster and St George venues. The cost of the bike for hire is PS5. UK law does not require you to wear a helmet, but if you do wear one it should fit correctly.
