0,C,"['there are so many kinds of local newspapers there', 'local papers should have a circulation of four million', 'the usual number of copies of the newspapers there is large', 'British newspapers are read by everyone']",Visitors to Britain are surprised to learn that_.,"Visitors to Britain are sometimes surprised to learn that newspapers there have such a large circulation . For example, national newspapers, the ""Daily Mirror "" and the ""Daily express"" both sell about four million copies everyday. Most of British families buy a newspaper every morning and two or three on Sundays.
Besides the national papers, there is, however, another branch of the British newspapers, local newspapers. Local newspapers have a weekly circulation of 13 million. Almost every town and county area has one. Nearly all them hold their own and many of them are very profitable .
These papers are written almost entirely for readers interested in local events-births, weddings, deaths, council meetings and sports. Editors prefer to believe people who know the district well. A great deal of local news is regularly supplied by clubs and churches in the neighborhood.
The editors must never forget that the success of any newspaper depends on advertising. But if the newspaper is well written and the news items have been carefully chosen to draw local readers, the business men will thank for the chance to keep their products in the public eyes.",high23862.txt
