2,A,"[""Susan doesn't like studying and she only wants to play."", 'The teachers in school teach Susan and other students many things.', 'Susan thinks her teachers are good.', 'In school, students can learn good things and make good friends.']",Which one is NOT true?,"My name is Susan. I am a junior high school student. I like my school and my friends. I like my school because we have good teachers. They teach us many things.
But then, I don't understand   lots of things about school. I don't understand why we have to take so many tests  . I have to take a heavy school bag with many books in it. I may have a test anytime. I don't like taking tests all the time.
I wonder if I like my school life. It is hard for me to answer this kind of question. On one hand   I am not happy because there are so many tests in the school; on the other hand I am happy because I can learn a lot and I can make good friends in school.
