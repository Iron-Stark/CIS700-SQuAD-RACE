2,A,"['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth']",From the story we know that this was the  _  time for Mr and Mrs Smith to go to London.,"Mr and Mrs Smith had always spent their summer holidays in New Jersey ( ) in the past, staying in a small inn at the foot of the hill.
One year, however, Mr Smith made a lot of money in his business, so they decided to go to London and stay at a really good hotel while they went touring around the famous city.
They flew to London and arrived at their hotel late one evening. They had expected that they would have to go to bed hungry, because in that small inn in New Jersey, no meals were served after seven. They were surprised when the waiter asked whether they would take dinner there that night. "" Are you still serving dinner?"" asked Mr Smith. "" Yes, certainly, sir,"" answered the waiter. "" We serve it until half past nine.""
"" What are the time of the meals then?"" asked Mr Smith. "" Well, sir, We serve breakfast from seven to half past eleven in the morning, lunch from twelve to three in the afternoon, tea from four to five, and dinner from six to half past nine."" answered the waiter.
"" But that hardly leaves any time for us to see the sights of London."" said Mr Smith.",middle3713.txt
