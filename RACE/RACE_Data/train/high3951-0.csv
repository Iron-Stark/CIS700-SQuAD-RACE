But the 61-year-old man from Shandong Province has made scientific breakthroughs , which made great contributions to China's food security . His main work has been in achieving the higher output of corn production.
Li, who holds the world record for the highest output of summer corn, once says, ""Corn has a life; it sings and dances. If you listen clearly, it can speak to you."" He started his research in 1969 when he was 20 and just dropped out of a high school. He then read an article which pointed that corn output per mu in the USA was six times higher than that in China.
