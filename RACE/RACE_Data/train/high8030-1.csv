1,B,"['he was very busy', 'it was a personal letter', 'there was a PS10 note in it', 'the letter was unimportant']",Why didn't the secretary open the letter? Because   _  .,"Last week the manager of an old jeweler's shop received a letter marked ""personal"", so of course his secretary gave it to him unopened. As he was very busy, the letter lay on his desk till tea-time. Then he opened it and aPS10 note fell out onto his desk. With the note was a short letter. This is what it said:
Dear sir,
In 1935 I got engaged. But unfortunately at that time there was a lot of unemployment and I lost my job. I was six months without a job and then I got work again. But of course I was very short of money. I came to your shop to buy a wedding ring. The assistant brought some rings for me to look at, but she was called away for a moment, and I put one of the rings in my pocket. When she came back, I said I did not know the size of my girl-friend's finger. So I left the shop without buying a ring.
My wife died a short while ago and the fact that I never paid for her ring has been on my conscience   all these years. At the time the ring cost PS2 so I reckon   that is about PS10 at today's price. And I am sending you that amount.
Yours truly,
A customer
