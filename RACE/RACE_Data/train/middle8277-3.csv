3,B,"['There are many special camps in the USA now.', 'Families prefer traditional camps to special camps.', 'Special camps can be in the middle of nature or a big city.', 'In technology camps, children can create games of their own.']",Which one is NOT true according to the passage?,"Millions of children in the United States go to summer camps. Some go to play outdoors at traditional camps in the woods, in the mountains or on lakes. But families now have many choices of special camps. These can be in the middle of nature or a big city. Special camps offer young people the chance to learn about different subjects: anything from space exploration to business to medicine.
In technology camps, one subject that children can learn about is video game design. They learn how to use computer programs to create games of their own. One program that teaches video game design is called Cybercamps. Children can learn how to design their own virtual  worlds to set their video game in. Then, they program their own rules and objects into the game.
Cybercamps also offers courses in robot building and Web design. A recent story in the Washington Post described how one child made a robot that could sing a song. Another made a robot that could follow a black line drawn on a piece of cardboard. Also, children can learn how to make Web sites. One child made a site for Pokemon, one of his favourite cartoon shows.",middle8277.txt
