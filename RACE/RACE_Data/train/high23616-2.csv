2,A,"['smiled', 'barked', 'rushed to them', 'tried to be funny']",Some people got frightened by Brownie when she   _,"When I was six, dad brought home a dog one day, who was called ""Brownie"". My brothers and I all loved Brownie and did different things with her. One of us would walk her, another would feed her, then there were baths, playing catch and many other games. Brownie, in return, loved each other and every one of us. One thing that most touched my heart was that she would go to whoever was sick and just be with them. We always felt better when she was around.
One day , as I was getting her food, she chewed up one of dad's shoes, which had to be thrown away in the end. I knew dad would be mad and I had to let her know what she did was wrong. When I looked at her and said, ""Bad girl,"" she looked down at the ground and then went and hid. I saw a tear in her eyes.
Brownie turned out to be more than just our family pet. She went everywhere with us. People would stop and ask if they could pet her. Of course she'd let anyone pet her. She was just the most lovable dog. There were many times when we'd be out walking and a small child would come over and pull on her hair. She never barked or tried to get away. Funny thing is she would smile. This frightened people because they thought she was showing her teeth. Far from the truth, she loved everyone.",high23616.txt
