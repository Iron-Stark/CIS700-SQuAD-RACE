3,B,"['Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.', ""Where there's a will, there's a way."", 'Actions speak louder than words.', 'The finest diamond must be cut.']",Which of the following can best describe Philippe Croizon's story?,"Imagine someone has crossed the seas joining five continents by swimming. It is a major success for anyone. But it is an even greater success for Philippe Croizon, who has no arms, and no legs! His achievements show that we can all achieve great things--no matter who we are.
Philippe Croizon was 26 years old when he had an accident. The doctors had to remove both of his arms and legs. ""When they cut off my last leg I wanted to die. I suffered great depression and my spirit was as low as you can get. But you have to choose--and I chose to live!"" said Croizon.
While he was recovering in hospital, Croizon saw a television programme about a woman who had been swimming across the English Channel. After watching the programme Croizon decided to do it. He began to exercise every day to make him strong and it took him two years to prepare.
Finally in 2010, Croizon was ready. He entered the cold, grey sea of the English Channel. He was now 42 years old. It took him from early morning until night to swim the distance. He felt a lot of pain. But he had become the first person without arms and legs to swim between France and England. Croizon had achieved his dream, but he did not stop there. He looked for a new goal.
Early in 2012 he planned to swim across the seas that join five major continents. During the next few months he swam between the four continents of Australia, Asia, Africa and Europe and finally in the cold waters of the Bering Strait between the continents of Asia and the Americas.
""We want to show people something. If disabled people have courage and a lot of training they can do the same things as those who are not disabled,"" said Croizon.",high5520.txt
