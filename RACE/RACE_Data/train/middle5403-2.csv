2,B,"['he had worked in a computer shop', 'he had written some computer programs', 'he is clever and works hard at his lessons', 'he had learnt computer from books and magazines']",He was employed by the company because   _,"Computer programmer David Jones earned $ 150,000 a year designing new computer games, yet he cannot find a bank prepared to let him have a check card . Instead, he has been told to wait another two years until he is 18.
He works for a small firm in Liverpool, where most young people of his age are finding jobs. David's biggest headache is what to do with his money. Though he has high payment, he cannot drive a car, or get credit cards.
David got his job four months ago, a year after leaving school with six O-Levels  and working for a time in a computer shop. ""I got the job because the people who run the firm knew I had already written some programs,"" he said. ""I suppose $150,000 sounds a lot but I hope it will come to more than that this year."" He spends some of his money on records and clothes, and gives his mother $20 a week as he lives with his parents. But most of his spare time is spent working. ""Unfortunately, computing was not part of our studies at school,"" he said. "" But I had been studying it in books and magazines for four years in my spare time. I knew what I wanted to do and never considered staying on at school. Most people in this business are fairly young, anyway. I would like to earn a million and I suppose early retirement is a possibility. You never know when the market might disappear.",middle5403.txt
