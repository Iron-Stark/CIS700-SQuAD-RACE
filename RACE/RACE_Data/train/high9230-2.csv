2,B,"['what you write can catch their eyes', 'your thoughts are outstanding besides that you & your parents permit the web to use them', 'they can be put in the advertisement', 'they can use them anywhere, anytime & in any way they want']","According to the passage, your words can be adopted by the web as long as  _  .","This is the legal part of the show. It's just so everybody knows the rules for Nickelodeon on the Web. Be sure to get your parents to review and discuss these rules with you:
1.All the toys and games here are just for you to play with. You can't sell them,give them to anyone,or pretend you made them. You can't do anything EXCEPT play with them,unless you ask us first and we say it's OK.
2.If you see something you don't like,remember that all the stuff on the message boards  ,chat rooms and ""Write to Nick""comes straight from other kids,not from someone at nick.com. Nick.com wouldn't tell kids what to say,because kids have minds of their own!But if someone sends ugly messages,we'll do our best to take care of it. We all want nick.com to be a good,clean place to hang out.
3.If you write something that catches our eye in ""Write to Nick""on a message board or in a chat room,we might want to use it on the site. By sending in your thoughts and hanging out in the chat rooms,and getting your parent's permission to do so,you and your parents are telling us it's OK to repeat what you say. It's even OK to put it in an advertisement. It means we can use it in any way we want,anywhere,until the end of time.
Remember to ALWAYS check with your parents before you send anything to us. And of course,the folks in the legal office upstairs have their own code for saying all that. Please read these terms and conditions carefully before using this website. This site at nick.com is fully controlled and operated by Nickelodeon Online,a business unit of MTV Networks.",high9230.txt
