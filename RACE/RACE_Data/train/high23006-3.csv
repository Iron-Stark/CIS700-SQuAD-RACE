3,D,"[""Money is not limited and we can't have it all."", 'Something that costs 20 dollars can only be sold for 5 dollars.', 'Natural resources can never be used up.', 'Some people can be rich while other people can be poor.']",Which of the following is true according to this passage?,"When people have money, they have the freedom to choose how to use it. Some people have more money than others, but no one has all the money in the world. The amount of money we have is limited. The supply of goods, land, and resources is limited. Because of this, people can not have or buy everything that they might want. This means that if you have only five dollars to spend, you can not buy something that costs ten dollars. As our country has grown in the number of citizens, the price of goods has increased. In the recent years the cost of food, clothing, housing and cars has risen quickly. The price of films and books has gone up. In a time when prices are rising, people cannot buy as much with the money as before.",high23006.txt
