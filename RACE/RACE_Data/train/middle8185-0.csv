0,D,"['Tuhao', 'Hukou', 'Dama', 'All above']",_    may be adopted in the Oxford English Dictionary in 2014 according to the passage.,"The Oxford English Dictionary (OED, ) is thinking of adding the Chinese word tuhao   to its 2014 edition  .
The word has become popular in China during the past few months to describe newly rich people who spend money in extravagant(,)ways. Tuhao has
in Western countries, too, to describe similar people in their countries.
The adoption   of the word by foreign countries is an example of China's spreading influence in the world not just economically, but also socially and culturally. People are paying attention to what is happening in China and are picking up some Chinese words in the process, especially those words that express unique   Chinese ideas that cannot be easily translated   into English.
The OED is also thinking of adding hukou   and dama   to the already 120 Chinese words in its dictionary. Hukou refers to   China's system of residency permits   and dama refers to middle-aged Chinese women whose gold buying habits influence the global gold markets. The news that the OED was adding these words has met with some criticism  . Some people say the words embarrass   China, but others insist that in a globalized   society it's natural for words to spread and be adopted elsewhere. In fact, a word like tuhao expresses the humor of China. It's easy to pronounce   and very accurate   at poking fun at   rich people who have more money than taste.",middle8185.txt
