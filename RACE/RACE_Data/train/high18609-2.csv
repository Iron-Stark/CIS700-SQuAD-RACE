2,D,"['She wanted to call the police.', 'She decided to talk with the o1d lady.', 'She decided to take away her own money.', 'She decided not to tell the 1ady and take the money away.']",What did Mrs. White decide to do when she found another ten pounds in her neighbor's handbag on the bus?,"One day Mr. White gave his wife ten pounds for her birthday -- ten new pound notes. So Mrs. White went out shopping. She waited for a bus, got on it and sat down next to an o1d 1ady. After a while, Mrs. White noticed that the old 1ady's handbag was open. Inside it, she saw a wad of pound notes exactly like the ones her husband had given her. So she quickly looked into her own bag -- the notes had gone! Mrs. White was sure that the o1d lady next to her had stolen them. She immediately thought of calling the police. But as she disliked making a fuss , she decided to take back the money from the old 1ady's hand bag and say nothing about it. She looked around to make sure nobody was watching. Then she carefully put her hand into the o1d lady's bag, took the notes, and put them into her own handbag. 
    When she got home that evening, Mrs. White showed her husband the beautiful hat she had bought. 
    ""How did you pay for it?"" Mr. White asked. 
    ""With the money you gave me for my birthday, of course"" she answered. 
""Oh? What's that, then?"" he asked, as he pointed to a wad of pound notes on the table.",high18609.txt
