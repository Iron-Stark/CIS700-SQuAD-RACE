1,D,"['To introduce the home-study courses.', 'To show she has realized her dream.', 'To prove she is a qualified writer.', 'To promote the writing program.']",Why does Kristi Hill mention her own experience of attending the courses?,"Dear friends,
The recent success of children's books has made the general public aware that there's a huge market out there.
And there's a growing need for new writers trained to create the $3 billion worth of children's books bought each year... plus stories and articles needed by over 650 publishers of magazines for children and teenagers. Who are these needed writers? They're ordinary people like you and me.
But am I good enough?
I was once where you might be now. My thoughts of writing had been pushed down by self-doubt, and I didn't know where to turn for help.
Then, I accepted a free offer from the Institute to test my writing ability, and it turned out to be the inspiration I needed.
The promise that paid off
The Institute made the same promise to me that they will make to you, if you show basic writing ability: you will complete at least one manuscript   suitable to hand in to a publisher by the time you finish our course.
I really didn't expect any publication  before I finished the course, but that happened. I sold three stories. And I soon discovered that was not unusual at the Institute. Since graduation, I have written 34 nationally published children's books and over 300 stories and articles.
Free test and brochure
We offer a free ability test and will send you a copy of our brochure describing our recognized home-study courses on the basis of one-on-one training.
Realize your writing dream today. There's nothing sadder than a dream delayed until it disappears forever.
Sincerely,
Kristi Hill
