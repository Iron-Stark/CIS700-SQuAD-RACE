It's the most important meal of the day!"" Why are parents always saying that?
Well, a person is like a car. After a long night of sleeping, there is no fuel in your fuel tank . Breakfast is like the fuel. It makes you work or walk on the road.
What should you eat? Any breakfast is better than no breakfast, but try not to have hamburgers or dessert  all the time. They don't have the necessary nutrients . And if you have a hamburger for breakfast, you won't feel full for long.
