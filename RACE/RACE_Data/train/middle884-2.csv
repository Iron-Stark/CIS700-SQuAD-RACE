Every morning, after the man gets up, the bird says ""hello"". When the man comes back from his work, the bird says, ""Is that you? Come here. I can see you."" One evening, when the man is sleeping, a thief comes into his building by climbing up the window. When he finds some money and begins to leave the house by climbing down through the window again, he hears a voice in the dark.
