3,C,"['To advise us to turn off TV.', 'To warn parents of the danger of TV.', 'To report to us a piece of news about TV.', 'To praise Vespe and his organization.']",What's the writer's purpose in writing this passage?,"WASHINGTON--There are more than 222 million TVs in American homes. And it would make Frank Vespe very happy this week if every one was turned off.
       Vespe is head of the TV--Turnoff  Network, the Washington organization behind TV Turnoff Week. For TV Turnoff week, American kids are encouraged to go one week without watching TV. This year it runs from April 23 to 29.
       ""Our real meassage here is to see what lift is like without TV and then make watching TV a conscious decision,""said Vespe.
       Vespe said that most of the kids who go without television for a week go back to watching, but not as much.""They watch more selectively. They do more things as a family. It helps them put TV in its place.
       One kid who is turning off her television is Sarah Foote, 9, of Virginia.""
       Sarah admits it won't be too hard to give up TV. She's allowed to watch only educational television, and her favourite show from last year isn't on any more.
       Of course, there are plenty of good things about TV: programmes can be entertaining, even educational.
       Even so, some experts aren't sure TV Turnoff Week is the answer.
       ""Too much TV is not good. A little bit of TV for young kids is good because it adds to their vocabulary. The bottom line is moderation ,""says Susan Neuman, a university educator who studies kids and reading.
       Neuman says the real problem is that parents do not keep track of what their kids are watching.
       They do not set limits on TV viewing. Also, in some families, TV might be the only thing there is to do.
       What message does Sarah have for other kids?
       ""It's a very good idea. I survived a whole week without TV. It also teaches you to enjoy time doing different things and not being sucked into something on TV, because you do not want TV taking up all of your time,""Sarah said.",high22999.txt
