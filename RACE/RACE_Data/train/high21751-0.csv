       ""Children as young as seven have the ability to find their way around."" says Jim Martland .Research Director of the project . ""However if they are not allowed out alone or are taken everywhere by car ,they never develop the skills""
       Jim Martland also emphasizes that young people should be taught certain skills to improve their sense of direction .He makes the following suggestions.
       *If you are using a map ,turn it so it relates to the way you are facing.
       *If you leave your bike in a strange place ,put it near something like a big stone or a tree.
Note landmarks on the route as you go away from your bike .When you return ,go back 
along the same route
       *Simplify the way of finding your direction by using lines such as streets in a town,streams ,or walls in the countryside to guide you .Count your steps so that you know how far you have gone and note any landmarks such as tower blocks or hills which can help to find out where you are.
