I'm sorry to hear that you didn't get good grades in math mid-term exam. And you said you spend a lot of time studying math. However, it is difficult for you to learn it well. I think you should find a right way to learn it. Here is my advice for you.
During the class
* Listen to the teacher and be sure to write down everything the teacher puts on the blackboard.
* If you don't understand a step or how to get the answer to the question, ask the teacher or a classmate for help right now.
* Underline key points while taking notes.
After the class
* Recopy each day's notes into a new notebook clearly.
* Do your homework every day carefully. And don't copy other students' homework.
* If a step is unclear or you don't know how to do it, ask for help soon. _ 
* Look for useful examples of how this kind of difficult problem is used in your textbook or other materials 
Before exam
* Review  all of your notes quickly and find out every missing problem at times.
* Work examples in the text each several times until you can do them quickly. This will help you improve the speed  needed for the exam.
If you do as I said, I think you will get good grades in the final exam. Come on! Mary.",middle7644.txt
