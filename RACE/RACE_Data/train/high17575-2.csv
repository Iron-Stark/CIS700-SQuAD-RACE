2,D,"['He did a part-time job to support his own education.', 'He never thought of giving in.', 'He dreamed to be the first in his family to receive education.', 'He will invite gardeners to attend his graduation ceremony.']",What do we know about Noel?,"A mansion  may symbolize the American dream. But the fact is, for most immigrants, the closest one they ever get to is the neighboring bushes.

    That is why, not long ago, Tabia started the Bay Area Gardeners Foundation. It's a charity aiming at helping smart kids like Noel Chavez, whose dream was to become the first in his family to graduate from college.Unfortunately, since Noel is still waiting for his citizenship, he's not qualified for financial aid.And after just a few months of going to school full-time and working full-time, he was ready to give in.

We work for clients with a lot of money. "" Tabia and his gardener friends just started knocking on those mansion doors-and the checks have been rolling in ever since.  ""There might be some gardeners at your graduation,"" someone said to Noel.""I'm sure there will and I'm going to invite them,"" he replied.
    Tabia is now hoping this idea catches on with the gardeners around the country. And whether that happens or not, and whether he realizes it or not, Tabia has already finished what he came to America to do-become somebody.",high17575.txt
