This lovely poem was written by Emily Dickinson, who is considered a major American poet, though she was not accorded   this honor until well after her death.
Emily Dickinson was born on December 10, 1830, in Amherst, Massachusetts. She attended school for only one year. Throughout her life, she seldom left her home and visitors were few. She lived in almost complete isolation  from the outside world.
She admired the poetry of Robert and Elizabeth Barren Browning, as well as John Keats. Though she was dissuaded   from reading the poetry of her contemporary Walt Whitman by rumors of its disgracefulness, the two poets are now connected by the distinguished place they hold as the founders of a uniquely American poetic voice.
While Dickinson was extremely prolific   as a poet, she was not publicly recognized during her lifetime. Upon her death, Dickinson's family discovered forty hand-bound volumes of nearly 1,800 poems. Her younger sister began to share the enormous body of work that Emily left behind.
Emily's odd punctuation, capitalization , and formatting  did not meet with standard publishing ""approval"" for earlier editions. There is a whimsical   nature to many other poems, as the subject of death was the most frequent theme.",high12197.txt
