2,D,"['not mentioned in the text', 'building a strong party and a friendly image', 'the problems of immigrants and economy', 'the problems of economy and international relations']",The challenges that will face the new president are   _  .,"The curtain on the 2008 US presidential election finally rose last month as John McCain and Barack Obama were formally nominated   as candidates of the two major parties. This may be one of the hardest decisions voters have to make between two appealing candidates. 
The big question for voters, as they face both an economic downturn and international threats, is: who will they elect? A young first-term senator promising change and new ideas, or a longtime senator with strong military experience and a reputation as a maverick  ?

And perhaps most important of all, will swing   voters be more drawn to Obama's vision   or to McCain's experience?
