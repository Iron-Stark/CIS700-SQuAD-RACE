""That's easy,"" answered the fisherman. ""I know one way to make you become cleverer.""
""Really?""
""Of course. It is said a fish head is good for brain. If you eat one, you'll become cleverer indeed. Pay only three pounds for one fish head."" The boy paid him three pounds and the fisherman cut off a fish head and handed it to him.
A raw fish head is not good--not even for a hungry boy to eat but the boy ate it up in two gulps.
""Do you feel anything?"" asked the fisherman.
""Not in my head,"" said the boy.
The boy lay on the ground and thought. ""One whole fish costs only two pounds. I had paid him three pounds for the fish head. Why couldn't I have the whole fish for soup, a head for brain and one pound left over?"" He jumped up and shouted at the fisherman. ""You thief! You are fooling me!"" The fisherman laughed, saying, ""The fish head works now, you see. """,high14243.txt
