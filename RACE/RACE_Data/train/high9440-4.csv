4,C,"['Will the 2020 World Cup Be Held in the Middle East?', ""Qatar's 2022 World Cup in High Temperature"", 'Will Man-Made Clouds Provide Shade at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar?', 'Artificial Clouds at High Cost Promising Comfortable Season']",Which of the following can best serve as the title of this passage?,"With the World Cup always held in the European off-season in June and July, when the tiny nation of Qatar beat out USA Australia, Japan and South Korea, as the venue of the 2022 World Cup Soccer, there were gasps of surprise from the fans - it was not just because of the size of the competitors, but also the fact that Doha sees an average top temperature of 41 degrees Celsius  in June and July with the possibility of top temperatures as high as 50degC.
Since the World Cup cannot be moved to the 'cooler' season in January or to a neighboring country with milder weather, Qatar has to figure out a solution to make the game more comfortable. A team of engineering scientists from Qatar University (QU) have taken a more high-tech approach to solving the problem - they've reportedly developed a type of artificial ""cloud"" designed to float above the World Cup venues and provide fans and players with relief from the blazing sun.
The artificial clouds system was invented by a team led by Dr Saul Abdul Ghani, Head of the Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department at QU, who told Gulf News that the ""clouds"" would be made from a lightweight carbon structure carrying a giant envelope of material containing helium gas. The ""cloud"" would also feature solar panels on its upper surface to power engines that allow the cloud to be moved via remote control. While the country officials have promised to improve some of the issues with solar-powered stadiums capable of reducing the temperatures inside, to a comfortable 20degC, there is still concern of how the players will be able to function in the practice fields.
The system would initially cost around US$500,000, with prices coming down with commercial scale production. However, since Qatar needs to find a solution, the money is probably to the issue. The bigger question is, will this team of scientists actually be able to conjure up something that they have promised? We will all find out in about eleven years!",high9440.txt
