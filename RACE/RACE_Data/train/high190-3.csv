Nobody cared about him. He always failed in his exams. So his teachers didn't like him, and nor did his classmates play with him.
Peter often slept in class because his heart was not in school. He almost gave himself up.
One day, Miss Jerry, a new teacher, came to Peter's class. She was a smiling, beautiful woman. Peter was in love! For the first time in his young life, he couldn't take his eyes off his teachers; yet, still he failed.
It was Miss Jerry's class. She was asking a question. ""I'd like the smartest boy to answer my question."" Then she said loudly, ""Peter, please!""
Peter was surprised. And he stood up without a word.
""Just try it! I believe you can!""
After school, Miss Jerry had a long talk with Peter. She told him that she cared about him and believed in him.
Peter thought a lot that evening. From then on he arrived at school on time every day. Miss Jerry helped him with his homework in the afternoon. She even cooked delicious food for him. She told Peter, ""Nothing is impossible if you put your heart in it.""
Later, Miss Jerry gave another exam. Peter did it with all his heart. He was very excited to find that he had passed the exam. Now Peter discovered that not only could he learn well, but he could do it well. A change took place in Peter's heart.",high190.txt
