0,B,"['He wants to seek a comfortable settlement.', ""It's thought that the Boog is beyond control."", 'The Boog is required to find enough food.', 'The Boog is eager to make new friends.']",What's the key factor  that the Boog need to survive himself in the wild?,"A twisted sense of humor and a strong voice cast  make ""Open Season"" fun for kids and adults. It's a great start for Sony's animation studio.
Boog is a full-grown grizzly bear that has been raised among humans by park ranger Beth. He has a warm place to live, all the food he wants, and is safe from hunters.
However, when he crosses paths with the spastic  mule deer Elliot, all that changes. Thanks to a series of misunderstandings, everyone believes Boog is dangerous and out of control. Beth is forced to release  him back into the wild.
Once Boog finds himself in the great outdoors, he has no idea what to do. He gets lost, can't find food, and is attacked by unfriendly forest cutters. Boog is forced to rely on the idiotic Elliot to help him find his way back to civilization . But can they _ before open season begins for hunting?
The movie also has a really strong voice cast. Martin Lawrence voices Boog, and his attitude and persona perfectly fit the bear. The same goes for Aston Kutcher as Elliot. Even if you can't stand him in the real world, you'll be surprised how well he brings the annoying deer to life in the movie.
The animation in ""Open Season"" is also excellent. The characters are quite cartoonish, but the hair is realistic looking and the movements are fantastic. The body language adds a lot to the performances of the characters.",high7172.txt
