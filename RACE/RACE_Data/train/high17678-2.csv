2,D,"['Courage is very important in face of failure.', 'Love can help us go further in the world.', 'The effort we make is more important than the result.', 'Digging a hole through the earth means little.']","According to the passage,which of the following is TRUE?","If you have ever been sad because of failure,please remember,for often,achieving what you set out to do is not the most important thing.
A boy decided to dig a deep hole behind his house.As he was working,a couple of older boys stopped by to watch.""What are you doing?"" asked one of the visitors.""I want to dig a hole all the way through the earth!"" the boy answered excitedly.The older boys began to laugh,telling him that digging a hole all the way through the earth was impossible.After a while,the boy picked up a jar.He showed it to the visitors.It was full of spiders,worms and other insects.Then he said quietly and confidently,""Even if I can't dig all the way through the earth,look what I found along the way!""
The boy's goal was far too difficult,but it did cause him to dig.And that is what a goal is for--to cause us to move in the direction we have chosen,in other words,to cause us to dig!
Not every goal will be fully achieved.Not every job will end successfully.Not every dream will come true.Not every love will last.But when you fall short of your aim,maybe you can say,""Yes,but look what I found along the way!Look at the wonderful things which have come into my life because I tried to do something!""
It is in the digging that life is lived.And I believe it is joy in the journey that really matters.",high17678.txt
