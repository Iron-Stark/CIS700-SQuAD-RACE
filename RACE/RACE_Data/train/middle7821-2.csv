2,A,"['The teacher often said much to Jenny.', ""The teacher did something important in Jenny's life."", 'The teacher opened the world of books for Jenny.', 'The teacher read them all kinds of wonderful books.']",Which is NOT TRUE in the story?,"Dear Mrs. Smith,
I was a students of yours in Grade Six, and I hope you still remember me. I'm writing this letter because I want to let you know that the school year with you was important and special to me.
It made a big contribution to my life.
I know I was very quiet in your class, and you never said much to me. But you did something that made a big difference in my life. You see, all through my first year in school, I hated to read. Books were just words that had very little to do with me, and I was bored by them. I'll never forget the first day of Grade Six when you took out a thick book and began to read the story to our class. Your voice seemed to change with the people in the story, I couldn't wait until after lunch when you would read to the class. You read us all kinds of wonderful books.
During the summer after my year in your class, I missed hearing the stories you would read. So one day I picked up a book and read it all on my own. I found out that I could make the words interesting, too. I love to read! Thank you for opening the world of books for me.
Yours,
Jenny",middle7821.txt
