I have been in Hong Kong for a whole week. I will stay here for another week.
Hong Kong is really a great place to visit. There's so much to see and do here. And I've done so many wonderful things.
I've taken the cable car  to the Peak Galleria  . I've been to Hong Kong Racing Museum. I've known a lot about horse racing. I've also visited Ladies' Street. In the street I bought some beautiful clothes for my mother. Last night I went to a concert. Chinese traditional music has always been my favourite. This morning I went to Ocean Park and watched the dolphins perform. Dolphins are so clever. They can jump from the water to touch a ball, sway   their bodies to music, kiss people and even do math. Mr Host is going to take me to an Italian film festival in Hong Kong Cultural Centre tomorrow. I'm so excited because I have never seen an Italian film before. But some people say they're boring.
That's all. Best wishes!",middle1330.txt
