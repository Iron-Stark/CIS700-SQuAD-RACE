0,D,"['The notebooks', 'The school card', 'The pencil box', 'The pen']",What's not in the schoolbag?,"Dear Mary,
I must go to see your grandparents now.I prepare  these things for you.Your dictionary is in the bookcase.Your schoolbag is on the sofa.Your pencil box,notebooks and your school card are in the schoolbag.Your jacket is on the chair.Don't _ your watch.It's on the desk.
Love you.
