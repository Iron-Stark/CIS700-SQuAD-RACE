I'm your eraser Jill. This afternoon you lost me in your classroom. Simon found me and gave me to your English teacher Ms. Green. Now Ms. Green's three keys and I are in Ms. Green's bag. The bag is yellow. It's on Ms.Green's desk. Please call Ms. Green at 718-0167 and ask her for me. You can come to the library, too. Ms. Green is in the library now.
