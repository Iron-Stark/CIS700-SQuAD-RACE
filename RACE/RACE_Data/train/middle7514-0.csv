0,B,"['going to the park', 'going to the museums', 'playing computer games', 'going to the supermarket']",The writer likes   _   on weekends.,"I like visiting museums on weekends. In them I can see lots of interesting things. In London there are lots of museums. Across from my house is the British Museum. Going to the museum is free but I don't like going there. In the museum I can't speak with people. I can't touch  the things and I can't take photos.
The Science Museum is not near my home and I can't take photos in it. But I like going there, because I can run, touch the things and speak with people in it. In the museum, I can also do some interesting things by myself. It's a good way to learn about science. The Science Museum is _ from 10 am to 6 pm every day. If you have time, please visit it. It's my favorite place in the world.",middle7514.txt
