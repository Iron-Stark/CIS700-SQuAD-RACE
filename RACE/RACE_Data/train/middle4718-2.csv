It was already midnight, but what could the doctor do? He had to get up, put on his coat and go downstairs. When he opened the door, he saw a man standing with a hat in his hand. ""How do you do?"" said the man. ""Can you come at once to a place out of town? It's quite far but you have a car and I can show you the way.""
""Certainly,"" said the doctor. ""I'm quite ready. I can come at once."" After a few minutes the car was standing at the front door, the man got into the doctor's car, and they drove off. They drove on for a long time. Then the man said, ""Here we are. This is my home. Now I can pay you and you can go back to the town.""
