2,D,"['For 20 minutes.', 'For 2 hours.', 'For 1 day.', 'For 2 days.']",How long did the little elephant cry?,"Long ago, there was a little elephant. He left home and played in the forest alone. He stayed outside for many days and became dirty because he could not wash his back. All the other animals didn't play with him because he was dirty.
The elephant sat under a tree. He started to cry. He cried for two days. But nobody could see him there. So he went back home and asked for help. His mother told him,"" You have a long trunk  . It can help you wash your back.""
He and his mother went to the river and his mother taught him how to use the trunk to clean his back with water.
All the other animals came over to him and said, ""You are so clean now. Do you want to play with us?""
The elephant was so happy and said, ""Yes.""",middle6204.txt
