0,C,"['Parents.', 'Police.', 'Children.', 'Strangers.']",The passage is written for  _  .,"Parents are busy today. Sometimes they have to leave their children at home alone. For children, it is important to know how to keep themselves safe when they are at home alone. If you are one of them,what should you do? Let me give you some advice.
When you arrive at your home, you should check the doors and windows first. If they are broken, it says someone must have entered. If so, wait outside and tell your parents or the police. If everything appears normal,you should go inside and lock the door quickly. If something seems strange inside, you should ask your neighbour for help and call the police.
If someone knocks at the door, you should identify the visitor before you open the door. This can be done by saying, ""Yes, who is it?"" You can also look through the peephole to see if you know the visitor. If you don't know the person very well, don't open the door.
You should not allow strangers to enter the house or give out any information about your family. You should be polite when you talk with the stranger, but remain behind the closed door. If the visitor wants to speak to your parents, you should say that the parents can't come to the door at the moment and offer to take a message.",middle7377.txt
