Exactly As Described  Feb 15, 2010
Product arrived quickly. The description said there was a tear on the cover of the book. I was pleased that it was just a small tear and otherwise the book was in very good condition. This seller was honest and did not try to overplay the condition in order to make a sale.
Some good information  Feb 06, 2010
This book does have some good information, but it does not talk at all about eating organic food, grass fed beef, free-range eggs, etc. The poisonous pesticides   and artificial hormones   in our society have a huge effect on our health and some illnesses probably wouldn't even exist if it weren't for them.
Fantastic  Aug 05, 2009

This book will tell you exactly what's special about each food and what part of the body or disease it helps.  _ any health problems you have with this common sense food guide.",high20129.txt
