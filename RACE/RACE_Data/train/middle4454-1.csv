""Let's make her favorite banana bread and surprise her.""Nick took out a cookbook. ""I'll read the recipe, and you follow it. Get out a bowl and a spoon while I turn on the oven.""

The robot put the bananas into the bowl and was going to mash them with its hands. ""Stop!"" Nick said. ""Let's try this again. Peel the bananas, put them in the bowl, and mash them with the spoon."" Nick watched when Mosh peeled the bananas and put the peel   into the bowl. Again, Nick told Mosh to stop. Then he showed the robot which part of each banana should go into the bowl.

""Last, add flour  , milk and sugar,"" Nick said. ""Mix everything together. Then pour the batter   into the bread pan."" Mosh followed Nick's orders while Nick read the cookbook.

Nick answered, ""Mosh and I are making banana bread for Mom's birthday. It is a lot of work, but I think she will be surprised.""
