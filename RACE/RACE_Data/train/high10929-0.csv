0,D,"['She made Teddy feel ashamed', 'She asked the children to play with Teddy.', ""She changed Teddy's seat to the front row."", 'She told the class something untrue about herself.']",What did Mrs.Thompson do on the first day of school?,"There was a story many years ago of a school teacher----Mrs.Thompson. She told the children on the first day that she loved them all the same. But that was a lie. There in the front row was a little boy named Teddy Stoddard. He didn't play well with the other children and he always needed a bath. She did not like him.
Then Mrs. Thompson got to know that Teddy was actually a very good boy before the death of his mother. Mrs. Thompson was ashamed of herself. She felt even worse when, like all her other students, Teddy brought her a Christmas present too. It was his mother's perfume .
Teddy said, ""Mrs.Thompson, today you smell just like my Mom used to."" After the children left she cried for at least an hour. On that very day, she stopped teaching reading, writing and math. Instead, she began to teach children.
Mrs.Thompson paid particular attention to Teddy.The boy's mind seemed to come alive. The more she encouraged him, the faster he improved. By the end of the sixth grade, Teddy had become one of the smartest children in the class.
Six years went by before she got a note from Teddy. He wrote that he had finished high school, third in his class, and she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life. He went to college. Mrs.Thompson got two more letters from him with the last signed, Theodore F. Stoddar, M. D.  .
The story doesn't end there. On his wedding day, Dr.Stoddard whispered in Mrs.Thompson's ear,"" Thank you, Mrs. Thomson, for believing in me. You made me feel important and showed me that I could make a difference.""
Mrs. Thompson , with tears in her eyes, whispered back,""Teddy, you have it all wrong. You were the one who taught me that I could make a difference. I didn't know how to teach until I met you.",high10929.txt
