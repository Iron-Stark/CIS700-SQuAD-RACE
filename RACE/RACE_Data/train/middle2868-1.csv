Here are some examples of bad behaviour:

Here are some of the ways that UK school children can be punished:
* Exclusion : a pupil is asked to leave the school and not come back. The pupil has to find a new school or a different method of education.
* Suspension : a pupil cannot enter the building or attend lessons until the school has a meeting about their situation. Suspension can last from one to 45 days. The pupil is usually given work to do at home with a special teacher.
* Detention : a pupil is asked to stay after school and work for 30-60 minutes before they can leave.
* Lines: a pupil has to write a sentence many times (e.g. 100 or more) on a sheet of paper, e.g. ""I must not shout in class.""
Freya MacDonald, a 15-year-old pupil from Scotland, _ when she refused to accept her school's punishment. Her family says that she was given 11 detentions for trivial things such as having fizzy drinks in class and coming into school through a fire door.
Freya says that repeated detentions ruined her right to an education under Scottish law and made it difficult for her to learn. So she refused to return until the school respected her civil rights. She wants the headmaster and her teachers to sign a letter to promise this. Hundreds of schools in Scotland were told not to use detention as a punishment because of her legal action.
Many UK schools now give parents a home&school contract(,), explaining their discipline and rules. Parents must sign this document to agree that they accept the school's rules and discipline and that they are responsible for their child's behaviour.",middle2868.txt
