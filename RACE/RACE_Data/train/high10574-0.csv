0,C,"['to Mexico together.', 'deaf since they were born.', 'friends since they were very young.', 'to different high schools.']",Orlando and German have been  _  .,"Deaf teenagers Orlando Chavez and German Resendiz have been friends since kindergarten. Together the two boys, who go to Escondido High School in California, have had the difficult job of learning in schools where the majority of the students can speak and hear.
Orlando lost his hearing at the age of one. German was born deaf, and his parents moved from Mexico to find a school where he could learn sign language. He met Orlando on their first day of kindergarten.
""We were in a special class with about 25 other deaf kids,"" German remembers. ""Before then, I didn't know I was deaf and that I was different.""
""Being young and deaf in regular classes was very hard,"" signs Orlando. ""The other kids didn't understand us and we didn't understand them. But we've all grown up together, and today, I'm popular because I'm deaf. Kids try hard to communicate with me.""
Some things are very difficult for the two boys.""We can't talk on the phone, so if we need help, we can't call an emergency service,"" German signs. ""And we can't order food in a drive-thru.""
Despite their difficulties, the two boys have found work putting food in bags at a local supermarket. They got their jobs through a ""workability"" program, designed for teenagers from local schools with different types of learning disabilities.
German has worked in the supermarket since August, and Orlando started in November.
""The other people who work here have been very nice to us,"" Orlando signs.""They even sign sometimes. At first, we were nervous, but we've learned a lot and we're getting better.""
The opportunity to earn money has been exciting, both boys said. After high school, they hope to attend the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in New York.",high10574.txt
