0,C,"['daughters', 'students', 'parents', 'females']",The passage is written for  _  .,"Your daughter has finally reached the age of 18, and you think perhaps your job will finally get a little easier. That could be wrong thinking - as the parent of any 18-year-old will tell you.  Learning to _ an ungrateful 18-year-old daughter takes patience, understanding and time.
 _  When she was a little girl, she wanted you to be involved  in everything of her life from her daily activities to her friends. This is' no longer the case. She's a grown woman who needs her own personal life. Comment  on her choices only when asked to do so - especially if you want to say no to her.
Allow her to make mistakes. No parent wants to see his or her child fall, but the days of protecting her all the time are at an end. Unless  you see a train coming, let her fall when she makes poor choices. It will enable her to grow past the ungrateful ""know it all"" stage.
Encourage dialogue whenever you can, rather than planning talks. She's more likely to open up to you when talking over something trivial  . Anytime she wants to talk, become a willing listener in the conversation. You never know when a deeper, more important conversation will develop.",middle1847.txt
