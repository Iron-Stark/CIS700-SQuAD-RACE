We warmly welcome you to the Shine Sports Centre!
All the young people in this city can become members of the Shine Sports Centre and each member should pay $10 every year. To be a member of us and get your membership card ,you need to come to us between 2 pm and 6 pm, Monday to Thursday. I have to tell you that we don't accept new members on Friday. Now, there are three things that you must remember to bring with you when you come for a membership card. They are your ID card, a recent passport-sized photo of yourself and the money. We can't give you the card unless you bring all the three.
Once you have got your membership card, you need to bring it with you whenever you come to book or use any facility in Shine Sports Centre. Booking over the phone is not allowed, so you have to come here with your card when you want to book. There is one more thing I have to tell you. Our opening hours is from 9 am to 10 pm on weekdays and from 10 am to 6 pm on weekends. We hope that every member can have a great time in the Shine Sports Centre.",middle174.txt
