1,B,"['say nothing but smile', 'say something nice about others around you', 'look others up and down', 'tell others you are a shy person']","If you find it difficult to start a talk, you can   _  .","If you think you are too shy and want to be a little bit braver, just try the following things:
You can make it. Tell people you are shy. There is no need to hide it. When they get to know you are a shy kid, they will understand you better. This also helps feel more _ in talks.
Try to smile more. When you smile, people think you are friendly and easy to talk with. Remember that other people have feelings, too; and most people will stay away from an angry--looking face.
Learn to be a good talker. If you find it hard to start a conversation, say something nice about people around you. Think about how great you feel when someone says something nice to you. Doesn't it make you want to keep talking to that person?
Get your attention elsewhere. Think more about ways to enjoy parties or games. Don't waste time worrying about your book or whether people like you or not.
Take one small step at a time. Each time when you say: ""Hi!"" or smile at someone, say to yourself: ""You can make it."" Keep trying and one day you'll never feel shy when you talk to others.",middle5644.txt
