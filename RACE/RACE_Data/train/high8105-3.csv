3,B,"['Understanding.', 'Disapproving.', 'Supportive.', 'Doubtful.']",What is Rachel Roxburgh's attitude toward rabbit owners?,"The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) is launching a new campaign called Hay Fever, which aims to teach rabbit owners how to correctly feed their rabbits.
Many rabbit owners wrongly take Bugs Bunny's advice and feed their rabbits an incorrect diet, according to the British animal charity. Rabbits do not naturally eat root vegetables, such as carrots, nor do they naturally eat lettuce , the charity said.
The charity said that people were using these foodstuffs as major parts of a rabbit's diet, when in fact they can cause health problems. Just 8% of owners knew what to correctly feed their rabbits, according to statistics.
This might explain why 11% of rabbits are suffering from tooth decay and a further 11% from digestive problems, according to research at the University of Bristol, commissioned by the RSPCA.
""We want all pet rabbits to be eating hay as their main food,"" said Rachel Roxburgh, an animal scientist for the charity. ""People also think their rabbits should eat carrots because that's what Bugs Bunny does. But he's a cartoon, real rabbits don't talk, and they shouldn't be eating carrots too often either.""
The RSPCA suggests giving rabbits daily handfuls of hay, around the same size as the rabbits themselves. They can also feed on grass, but not lawn clippings  .
To vary their diet and give them a treat, dark green vegetables are advised, including broccoli, kale and cabbage on a daily basis, as well as regular parts of commercial nuggets .
