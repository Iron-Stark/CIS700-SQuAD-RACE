1,B,"[""She didn't want to keep the things in one bag."", 'She hoped those things would bring happiness to her father.', 'She wanted to remind her father of the stories behind the things.', 'She enjoyed playing with her father.']",Why did Molly give her father a second bag?,"Every morning Molly gave her father the lunch bag before he set off for work. 
One morning,besides his usual lunch bag.Molly handed him a second paper bag.
""Why two bags?""her father asked.
""The other is something else, ""Molly answered.
""What's in it?""asked her father.
""Just some stuff.Take it with you.""Molly replied.
Not wanting to discuss the matter, put both bags into his briefcase, he kissed Molly and rushed off.At midday he opened Molly's bag and took out the contents:three small stones, a plastic dinosaur,a tiny seashell,a small doll,and 13 pennies...The busy lather smiled,finished eating, and swept the desk clean into the wastebasket.Molly's stuff included.
That evening,Molly ran up behind him as he was reading a newspaper.
""Where's my bag,Daddy?""asked Molly.
""What bag?""her father responded.
""The one I gave you this morning, ""said Molly.
""I left it at the office.Why?""said her father.
""I forgot to put this note in it, ""Molly said. ""and besides,Daddy,the things in the sack are those I really like-I thought you might like to play with them.You didn't lose the bag,did you, Daddy?""
""Oh,no, ""he said,lying.""I just forgot to bring it home.I'll bring it tomorrow."" 
While Molly hugged her father' neck, unfolded the note that read, love you.  s he ""I Daddy. "" Molly had given him her treasures--all that a 7-year-old girl held dear.
Love in a paper bag,but he missed it--not only missed it,but had thrown it in the wastebasket. So back he went to the office.Just ahead of the night guard,he picked up the paper bag. He put the treasures inside and carried it home carefully.The bag didn't look SO good,but the stuff was all there and that was of great importance.
After dinner,he asked Molly to tell him about the stuff in the sack. It took a long time to tell.Everything had a story or a memory.
""Sometimes I think of all the great times in this sweet life, ""he thought.
We should all cherish the moment with the people we love.That's what really matters. It's so simple and so easily forgotten.",high21471.txt
