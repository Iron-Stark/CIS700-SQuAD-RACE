2,B,"['students often have mental problems', 'parents complain about the ""scream rooms""', 'schools are responsible for problem students', 'Connecticut school lacks full-time psychologists']",Belin's example is used to show   _  .,"Parents at one Connecticut elementary school say they are angry over the use of so-called ""scream rooms"" to discipline  special needs students. The two rooms at Farm Hill Elementary School in Middletown, Conn., came under fire  after several students complained about the sounds of children yelling coming from the rooms, while building keepers reported having to clean up blood and urine  from their floors and walls.
Tricia Belin, whose two children attend the school, described the rooms as 6-by-4-foot space with concrete walls used to isolate special needs students who are disruptive  in the classroom. ""Closet is pretty much what it is,"" Belin said and her children are regularly subjected to ""screaming""coming from inside the rooms.
Belin said she complained to the school's principal when she first learned about them last October, and was told they were considered and ""alternative learning environment,"" but he did not say whether students were placed in them alone or with a teacher.
Shawn Archer, whose 10-year-old daughter also attends the school, said parents were never notified about the rooms and claims his child and others are fearful of them.
Board of Education Chairman Gene Nocera acknowledged in an interview that the reports about the rooms were ""disturbing"" and said school officials were investigating their use. ""We understand the parents' concerns and we take their concerns very seriously,"" Nocera said. ""We want to be sure our students are being treated safely."" He stressed that under school policy, no child is to be left alone at any time. He said the school district is looking to give more resources to the school, including hiring full-time psychologists and providing more training to all the teachers.",high22703.txt
