2,B,"['A New Way to Solve Water Problem.', 'A Machine to Make Water out of Air.', 'A Dehumidifier to Produce Water.', 'An Absolutely New Invention']",What's the best title for the passage?http://www.ks5u.com/gaokao/beijing/,"A gadget which makes water out of air could become the greatest household invention since the microwave.http://www.ks5u.com/gaokao/beijing/
Using the same technology as a dehumidifier ,the Water Mill is able to create a ready supply of drinking water because it can always get
from an unlimited source--the air.http://www.ks5u.com/gaokao/beijing/
The company behind the machine says not only does it offer an alternative to bottled water inhttp://www.ks5u.com/gaokao/beijing/
developed countries, but it is a solution for the millions who face a daily water shortage.http://www.ks5u.com/gaokao/beijing/
The machine works by drawing in wet air through a filter and over a cooling instrument which changes it into water droplets.It can produce up to 12 liters a day.The Water Mill will also produce more water when storms pass over, as the amount of water which is contained in the air increases. In keeping with its eco-development, the machine uses the same amount of electricity as three lights.    Inventor Jonathan Ritchey said, ""The demand for water is off the chart. So people are looking for freedom from water distribution systems that are shaky and unreliable.""
The machine, which is about 3 feet wide, is likely to cost PS800 when it goes on sale here in the spring. Its maker, Canadian Firm Element Four, roughly calculates that a liter of water costs around 20 pence to produce.
Environmentalists state that half the world's population will face water shortage because of climate change by 2080. One in five is said to lack access to safe drinking.
The Water Mill is not effective in areas where the amount of water contained in the air is below about 30 percent, but in Britain that won't be much of a problem.",high16272.txt
