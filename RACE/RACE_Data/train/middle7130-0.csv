0,B,"['It was very delicious.', 'It was awful.', 'It \nwas cheap and tasted nice.', 'It looked like a carrot.']","What did the man think of the red, long fruit?","A man walked to India from far away. When he got there, he saw a lot of fruit. Among them there was a big basket of very red, long fruit. And it was the cheapest in the shop. ""I'd like a kilogram of this kind of fruit, please,"" he said to the shop keeper. After the keeper gave him the fruit, he began to eat some of it. ""Oh, my God!"" he shouted. His eyes watered, his mouth watered; his eyes were burning, his head was burning; and his face became red. As he coughed, he jumped up and down, saying, ""Ah! Ah! Ah!""
But he still kept eating the fruit! Some people looking at him and said, ""You're crazy, man. Those are chilies ! You can't eat so many; they're not good for you! People use them as a _ , but only a little bit to put into food for taste. You can't just eat them like that; they're not fruit!""
But the man said, ""No, I can't stop! I paid money for them. It's my money!""
Sometimes we do a lot of things like that. We still continue just because we've put money, time, effort and love into it. Just like the man who ate the chilies and felt so bad but couldn't stop because he didn't want to waste the money he had paid.",middle7130.txt
