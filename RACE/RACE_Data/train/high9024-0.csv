0,C,"['It is neither a waste of money nor a waste of time.', 'It makes something really important to the society.', 'It makes its followers suffer a lot.', 'It is practical opinion to women.']","What do you think of the writer's idea about ""fashion"" ?","If women are exploited year after year,they have only themselves to blame.Because they tremble at the thought of being seen in public in clothes that are out of fashion ,they are always made use of by the designers and the big stores.Clothes which have been worn only a few times have to be put aside because of the change of fashion.When you come to think of it,only a woman is able to stand in front of a wardrobe  packed full of clothes and announcing sadly that she has nothing to wear.
Changing fashions are nothing more than the intentional  waste.Many women spend vast sums of money each year to replace clothes that have hardly been worn.Women who cannot afford to throw away clothing in this way waste hours of their time changing the dresses they have.Skirts are lengthened; necklines are lowered or raised, and so on.
No one can say that the fashion industry makes anything really important to society.Fashion designers are seldom concerned with important things like warmth and that woman will put up with any amount of discomfort,as long as they look right.There can hardly be a man who hasnt at some time in his life smiled at the sight of woman shaking in a thin dress on a winter day,or picking her way through deep snow in high-heeled shoes.",high9024.txt
