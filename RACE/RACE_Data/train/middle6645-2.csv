2,B,"['The writer is a mother.', 'The wheels of her bike were broken.', 'Her husband uses her bike sometimes.', 'She can take her daughter to school.']",Which of the following is NOT true?,"Two years ago my husband bought me a bicycle. If you live in a city, it is often faster than a car and you don't have to worry about parking . You can leave it anywhere. Because it has a seat at the back and a basket at the front, I can take my daughter to school, to the library, to the shops, to anywhere.
I use it most in summer when the weather is warm and dry. It can be very unhappy in winter when it is cold and the rain is heavy. Of course, you must be careful on a bicycle. Accidents are not the only problems. One day I went shopping and came back late. I found my front wheel  missing. So I have to walk to the bicycle shop.
My husband uses my bicycle sometimes for short journeys. He says it is better than waiting for a bus. He still uses his car for longer journeys. I think that all this sitting down is making him fat and lazy. On my bike I get lots of exercise and fresh air, and this makes me feel a lot younger.",middle6645.txt
