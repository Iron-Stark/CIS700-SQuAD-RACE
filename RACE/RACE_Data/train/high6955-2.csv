2,A,"['The Chinese learning in Chicago.', 'The ways to learn Chinese.', 'McCormick Primary School.', 'Globalization and Chinese learning.']",Which of the following is mainly about in this passage?,"The fourth-graders at Chicago's McCormick Primary School are unaware of the difficulty in learning Chinese. For most, who speak Spanish at home, it's becoming their third language. They've been learning and using Chinese words since kindergarten, and it's now second nature to give a hearty ""ni hao"" when strangers enter the classroom.
The classroom scene at McCormick is unusual, but it may soon be a common fixture  in American schools, where Chinese is rapidly becoming the hot new language. Government officials have long wanted more focus on security--useful languages like Chinese, and pressure from them--as well as from business leaders, politicians, and parents--has driven a quick growth in the number of programs.
Chicago itself is home to the largest effort to include Chinese in US public schools. The program here has grown to include 3,000 students in 20 schools, with more schools on a waiting list. Programs have also spread to places like Houston, Los Angeles, New York City, and North Carolina. It's true that the number of students learning Chinese is tiny compared with how many study Spanish or French.
 _ see knowledge of the Chinese language and culture as a help in a global economy where China is growing in importance. ""This is an interesting way to begin to engage with the world's next superpower,"" says Michael Levine, director of education at the Asia Society, which has started five new public high schools that offer Chinese. ""Globalization has already changed the arrangements in terms of how children today are going to need to think about their careers... The question is, when not whether, the schools are going to adjust.""
In Chicago, the trend extends beyond schools with high numbers of Asian students. ""The fact that my students are 98% low income and 99% Latino  and they are succeeding in _ , tells me everyone should have a try at learning languages,"" says Virginia Rivera, principal at McCormick. ""We want to give our young people opportunities to advance... and Chinese is a great opportunity to survive in today's economy,"" says Richard M. Daley, Mayor of Chicago.",high6955.txt
