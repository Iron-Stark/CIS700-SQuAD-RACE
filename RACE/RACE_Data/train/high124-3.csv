3,C,"['Home Builder Dan Phillips', 'Green Homes', 'Home Builder Dan Phillips Tunis Trash into Green Homes', ""A Home Builder' s Life""]",Which of the following might be the best title for the passage?,"Can you imagine living in a house built by recycled waste?
Texas home builder Dan Phillips transforms trash into artful treasures, creating beautiful floors with wood pieces, kitchen counters from ivory -colored bones and roofs out of license plates  .
The fantastic houses which spring from his imagination are made almost entirely of materials which would otherwise have ended up in a garbage area.
"" People have been doing this for hundreds of thousands of years; using whatever is available to build shelter, "" Phillips said.""If you think about carefully what could be used, then building materials are everywhere.
The thirteen homes he has built so far would fit better in an art museum than the residential streets of Huntsville, a conservative town of about 35 ,000 people.
Living in these houses is a bit like living in a roadside attraction.""Almost every day, somebody knocks on the door and says ' Is there any way that we could see?' ""said Edie Wells, an artist who rents a room in the Bone House.Her home features a stairway made of bones, floors covered in wine corks   and beer bottle caps.Wells said visitors are most impressed when they see a bathroom with its walls, floor and ceiling entirely covered with broken mirror pieces.
In addition, each house is highly energy efficient with plenty insulation   , an on-demand solar hot water heater and a system that can collect and recycle rainwater to clean the toilet and wash clothes.
Phillips founded Phoenix Commotion 12 years ago with the aim of creating a new model for sustainable housing.For as little as $ 10,000 it builds affordable homes for single parents, low-income families and artists.
The company has used hundreds of tons of construction waste by recycling the materials into habitable buildings.
Phillips tries to spread his recycled-house idea by speaking at events across the United States, and by using the Internet to reach out to like-minded individuals.Phillips said: ""I'm not going to be saving the world anytime soon.But there needs to be at least some visibility for this model in this century.",high124.txt
