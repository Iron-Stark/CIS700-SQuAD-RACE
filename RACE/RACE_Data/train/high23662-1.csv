Answer: A 60-ton whale on a flatbed truck exploding and raining blubber ( fat of whales) all over the sidewalk.
That's what happened in Taiwan recently, when a dead sperm whale being shipped to the Halobios Research Center for an autopsy  developed an extremely bad case of gas and blew up before it reached its destination.
The whale was found alive on a prefix = st1 /Taiwanbeach last weekend, and died shortly after it was discovered. Since the 56-foot whale was the largest whale ever beached onTaiwan's shores, scientists wanted to study it and perform an autopsy for educational purpose.
Obviously, too much time passed between when the animal died and the time it was set to be moved to the autopsy location, because it had already started to go bad. When things rot, they give off gases as a by-product. In the whale's case, the gases were trapped in its belly. The pressure inside the rotting creature grew so much that it popped like an over-filled balloon. Unfortunately, it was on a truck in the middle of the city of Taiwanat the time--- cars and shops lining the street were covered with whale bits and juices, much to their owners' discouragement.
According to the news reports, traffic was tied up for hours while officials tried to clean up the streets.
Newspaper editors worldwide were probably smiling to themselves, since they had a ready-made headline--- several reports about the incident were titled "" There She Blows!"" after the famous line from the book Moby Dick.",high23662.txt
