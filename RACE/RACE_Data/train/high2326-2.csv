2,A,"['Defining Your Goal', 'Visualizing Reward of Success', 'Overcoming the Fear of Air Travel', 'Sleepwalking Through life']",What would be the best title for this passage?,"The quest for success always begins with a target. As Berra once said , ""you get to be very careful if you don't know where you're going, because you might not get there.""
Too many people wander through life like sleepwalkers. Each day they follow familiar routines, never asking, ""What am I doing with my life?""and they don't know what they're doing because they lack goals.
Goal-setting is a focus of the will to move in a certain direction. Begin with a clear conception of what you want. Write down your goals and date them---putting them into words clarifies them. Rather than concentrating on objects to acquire and possess, focus on fulfilling your desires to do, to produce, to contribute to goal-setting that yields the true sense of satisfaction we all need.
It's important to visualize yourself accomplishing your goal. While losers visualize the penalties  of failure, winners visualize the rewards of success. I've seen it among athletes, statistics contrasting air and highway safety, but it made no difference. I had read too many articles describing crash scenes and imagined these scenes vividly. I had programmed myself, without realizing it ,to stay off planes.
Then one summer I had the opportunity to fly on a private plane with friends to a resort; I didn't want to miss out on a great vacation. So I spent two weeks imagining a smooth flight on a beautiful sunny day and an easy landing.
When the day arrived, I was eager to go . To everyone's surprise, I got on the plane and I loved every minute of it , and I still use the techniques I employed that day.",high2326.txt
