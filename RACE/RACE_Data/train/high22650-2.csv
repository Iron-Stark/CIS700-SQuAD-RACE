We invite you and your friends to join Jewish National Fund for our Walk to help the environment!
We must take responsibility for the Earth's future. You can help offset   our carbon emissions   by planting trees and contributing to Jewish National Fund's important environmental work in the event. 
Please feel free to contact: Donna Daniel at ddaniel@jnf.org or (818) 704-5454 x201. 
We look forward to seeing you there!  Each year we host a Walk event, which is a huge success, attracting over 2,000 people from around the Los Angeles area.
This year, the Walk has a new look. JNF partnered with the new green plan, GoNeutral. The GoNeutral campaign is focused on removing our carbon footprints from the Earth and contributing to a healthier future for our planet. Funds from the GoNeutral Walk will go towards JNF environmental programs to stop desertification  , promote water reuse, grow crops efficiently in the desert and create green ""lungs"" around cities.
This is an exciting and unique opportunity for you to support a very important effort, as well as enjoy a fun day filled with live entertainment, children's activities and much more at the park.
Thank you for your support and I look forward to your commitment to the GoNeutral Walk this year. For more information visit www.jnf.org/goneutral or www.walkforwater.org or www.jnf.org. Feel free to contact us at (818) 704-5454.",high22650.txt
