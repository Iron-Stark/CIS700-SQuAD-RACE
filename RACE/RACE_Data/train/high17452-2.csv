2,C,"['DINK Lifestyle', 'Follow a Career and Be a DINK', 'Why Be a DINK', 'Greatest Movement of 20th Century']",The best title of the passage can be,"Many would consider it crazy, but what has caused the sudden popularity of the DINK (double income,no kid) lifestyle? Mr. Buchanan lists three factors that lead to the DINK lifestyle and help explain why today's culture  _ the old idea that ""the good tile for a woman means a husband and a houseful of kids.""
    The first factor is what is generally called""the greatest movement of the 20th century"".The movement of women from their homes to offices,which is similar to the 19th century migration  of men from the farm to the factory.
    The second factor is some women begin choosing to follow a career  rather than raise a family.Modern industries offer well-paid jobs to able women,who can compete successfully with men. With more women working,families become wealthier and smaller.
    The third factor is the end of the""family wage"". Before 1964,employers paid a man a ""family wage"" enough to support a wife and family However, as women's pay has greatly increased.men's pay has dropped,and the traditional marriage and family have suffered Young women are now more likely to be financially independent and more likely to delay their marriage,or just not marry at all Some choose to be DINKs.
   Though not necessarily the best,to be a DINK has become an increasingly popular lifestyle choice,one that has gained more and more recognition in our society.",high17452.txt
