Situated in the southeast part of California, Death Valley covers an area of more than 3.3 million acres, even larger than the famous Yellowstone National Park.
Death Valley is a land of extremes. It is one of the hottest places on the surface of the earth. The highest ground temperature ever recorded was 93.9degC on July 15,1972. It is the driest place in North America with an average rainfall of only 1.96 inches a year. Death Valley also boasts  the lowest point in the western hemisphere.
Death Valley got its name in 1849, when a group of emigrants  were looking for a short cut to the gold fields of California. They were given the bad advice and went into the valley. Some of them were killed by the bad weather and harsh roads. When the rest finally walked out, they gave the area its name by saying to it ""goodbye, Death Valley"".
As the name might suggest, there is very little apparent vegetation  within Death Valley. First impression, however, can be deceiving . Death Valley includes more than 1,000 species of plants that have adapted to the harsh conditions.
Death Valley is also a land of beauties. Sunrise and sunset are two of the most spectacular attractions. Depending on different angles, they show many of the area's different moods. For the best viewing, plan to be there approximately one hour before sunset or before sunrise.
Death Valley National Park is open year round. In spite of the climate, hiking is one of the most popular activities in Death Valley. The surrounding mountains produce spectacular wildflower displays along with snow-covered peaks, breathtaking sand dunes , abandoned mines and industrial structures.",high24012.txt
