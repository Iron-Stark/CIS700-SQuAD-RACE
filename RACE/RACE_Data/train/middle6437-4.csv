4,D,"['love keeps one busy all the time.', 'love can make people happy and unhappy.', 'it is important to read the bill', 'we should learn to give and receive love']",We can know from the passage that  _  .,"A father was sitting at his desk and looking at his bills when his little son rushed in and said, ""Dad, because today is your birthday and you're 40 years old, I'm going to give you 40 kisses, one for each year!"" When the boy started kissing, the father shouted, ""Oh, Andrew, don't do it now. I'm too busy!""
The boy soon became silent as tears  fell down from his big blue eyes. Feeling sorry, the father said, ""You can finish the kisses later .""
The boy said nothing but quietly walked away. That evening the father said, ""Come and finish the kisses now, Andrew!"" But the boy didn't.
Unluckily, a few days later, the boy had an accident and died. His sad father wrote,""If only I could tell him how sorry I am for my thoughtless words and how much my heart is hurt.""
Love is a two-way street. We must warmly accept any loving acts, or others will take it as a ""No"" and it may leave a scar . If we don't have love, our life will lose its true meaning.
If we are too busy to give and receive love, we are too silly! Nothing is more important than loving the people who are important to us.",middle6437.txt
