2,C,"['You have to go now', '1 want to hang up', 'I have to go now', ""I don't want to talk""]","A polite way to finish a talk is to say""  _  ."".","""How are you?"" is a nice question.It's a friendly way that people  in the United States greet each other,but ""How are you?"" is also a very  unusual question.It's a question that often doesn't have an answer.The person who asks ""How are you?"" hopes to hear the answer ""Fine"",  even if the Derson's friend isn't fine.The reason is that ""How are you?"" isn't really a question and ""Fine"",isn't really an answer.They are  simply other ways of saying ""Hello!"" or ""Hi!"".
Sometimes,people also don't say exactly what they mean.For example,when someone asks ""Do you agree?"".the other person might  be thinking,""No,I disagree.I think you're wrong.""But it isn't very  polite to disagree so strongly,so the other person might say ""I'm not  so sure.""It's a nicer way to say that you don't agree with someone.
People also don't say exactly what they are thinking when they finish talking with other people.For example,many talks over the phone finish when one person says ""I have to go now.""Often,the person who wants to hang up gives an excuse:""Someone's at the  door.""""Something is burning on the stove.""The excuse might be real,or it might not.Perhaps the person who wants to hang up simply  doesn't want to talk any more,but it isn't polite to say that.The excuse is more polite,and it doesn't hurt the other person.
Whether they are greeting each other,talking about an idea,or finishing a talk,people often don't say exactly what they are thinking.  It's an important way that people try to be nice to each other,and it's part of the game of language.",middle5904.txt
