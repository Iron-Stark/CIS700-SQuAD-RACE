1,D,"['Because he felt they were causing trouble.', 'Because they were so familiar with the town.', 'Because they got the boy hidden somewhere.', 'Because he found them helpful though young.']",Why did the writer feel surprised when he saw the kids joined the search?,"Two weeks ago while my daughter and I were eating dinner I saw a police officer walking past my backyard with a worried looking woman following.
I went out, opened my door and asked if everything was okay. The woman was the grandmother of an eight-year-old boy who had gone missing an hour before. She was so anxious that she looked pale. With fear she trembled all the time.
They came to ask us about it. I said we hadn't seen the boy, but we would help to look for him. I asked my two-year-old daughter if she understood why we had to go looking for this boy and couldn't finish dinner right then. She replied, ""Be kind people, Daddy.""  _ !
We hopped  into our truck and went searching all over the town for about an hour and a half. Along the way, as we asked various strangers on the street if they had seen this little boy. A group of kids said they would help too. They hopped on their bikes and joined the search without any hesitation. I was surprised and very impressed. What a moving scene!
The little boy was found safe and sound a few miles away in forest. He had just decided to go on a little adventure on his own as his story said. Finding him, his grandmother was moved to tear.
I was just so happy to see so many people joined the search for a complete stranger. At least two dozen people from the neighborhood went looking for this boy just because being""kind people""was the right thing to do.",high21901.txt
