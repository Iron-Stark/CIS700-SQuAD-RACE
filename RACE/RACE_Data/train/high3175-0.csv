0,A,"['Cotillard once won the best actress Oscar.', 'Jennifer Lawrence was nominated because of The Hunger Games.', 'Mirren is the only one who can take the place of Jennifer Lawrence.', 'We cannot see the film Silver Linings Playbook before Thanksgiving.']","Which of the following statements is true, according to the passage?","""Who is that?"" When watching the movie, Silver Linings Playbook, at the Toronto International Film Festival in early September, the woman sitting next asked me.
It seemed to be a strange question. I wanted to ask if she ever saw a little movie called The Hunger Games, or the Oscar-nominated movie Winter's Bone. Instead, I just answered, ""Jennifer Lawrence."" But I wondered how a moviegoer does not recognize Lawrence! As Silver Linings Playbook continued to unfold and Lawrence revealed herself as a wonderful comic actress, it hit me: _ . That is the thing throwing her.
Audiences will have the opportunity to watch Lawrence's performance in Silver Linings Playbook when the film opens in limited release before a Thanksgiving weekend blowout expansion. The 22-year-old actress heads this year's lead actress Oscar race by a country mile. Here's an early main list of some competitors in this category.
1. Jennifer Lawrence in Silver Linings Playbook
2. Quvenzhane Wallis in Beasts of the Southern Wild
3. Marion Cotillard in Rust and Bone
3. Helen Mirren in Hitchcock
5. Emmanuelle Riva in Amour
6. Jessica Chastain in Zero Dark Thirty
Chastain, playing a CIA agent in Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty, is the wild card here and, quite possibly, the only candidate capable of replacing Lawrence from the top spot. The cruelty in Rust and Bone will put off sensitive academy members, making Cotillard lose chances for a second Oscar. Wallis makes for a wonderful story, but it is too early for her to be awarded a lead actress. Riva will need a push to win the nomination of lead actress.
Mirren, as the Alfred Hitchcock's wife and unsung partner, Alma Reville, might pose the biggest threat to Lawrence. Older academy members will love the historical Hollywood seen in Hitchcock, and Mirren's role as the unsung wind beneath Hitch's wings should find appreciation within creative circles. It's not ""The Queen"". but this year, it might be enough.",high3175.txt
