2,A,"['give you an accurate answer if he knows the distance', ""say that he doesn't know but he will encourage you to go on"", 'decide whether you are tired or not, and then tell you', ""tell you politely it is close though he knows it isn't""]","If you ask an American how far it is from the next village, he will   _  .","""How far is the next village?"" the American asks a man standing by the edge of the road. In some countries, because the man realizes that the traveler is tired and eager to reach his destination  , he will politely say ""Just down the road."" He thinks this is more encouraging, gentler, and therefore the wanted answer. So the American drives through the night, getting more and more angry, feeling ""being tricked"". He thinks the man on purpose lied to him, for obviously he must have known the distance quite well.
Had conditions been reversed  , the American would have felt he was ""cheating"" the driver if he had said the next town was not too far, and if he would be sorry to the weary driver, he would say ""You have a good way to go yet, it is at least fifteen miles."" The driver might be disappointed, but he would know what to expect.
