One day the headmaster of a school wrote to the post-office and asked for a post-office box for his school. He soon got an answer. It said, ""We will give you a post-office box in one month.""
Three months later, the headmaster wrote to the post-office and said, ""Why haven't we got a post-office box yet?""
This was the answer from the post-office:
""Dear sir,
We gave you a post-office box two months and wrote to you then to tell you. Here is the key to your box. You will find our letter to you in it.""",high11496.txt
