0,C,"['By buying them a jukebox machine.', 'By building senior centers for them.', 'By singing the old songs they ask for.', 'By playing the piano to raise money for them.']",How does Derek help the elderly?,"I often write about the bad state of television these days, but recently my mom told me about a story she saw on 60 Minutesthat was inspiring, educational, and entertaining for the whole family. I went to the show's website to see for myself. My mom was right. At a time when even Barbara Walters says she's really bored with celebrities interviews, this one will not disappoint.
It's the story of Derek Paravicini, a 30-year-old who was born three months early, physically disabled (he can't button his own shirt), blind, and severely autistic .
Yet, through total luck and coincidence, his family discovered that Derek had a remarkable musical talent when he was three.
Derek can hear any musical composition one time and play it perfectly on the piano.
That's right. He only has to hear it once.
Even more unbelievable, his brain, like a computer, can keep many songs that he can immediately repeat when asked. But his talent isn't limited to just learning things by heart. Derek is a true musical genius and artist who plays beautifully in a wide range of styles and can make his own music.
With his talent, Derek has raised millions of dollars putting on charity concerts. He also donates his time to senior centers where he acts as a human jukebox   machine, taking requests from senior citizens who haven't heard their favorite songs for decades.
As it turns out, Derek loves people and his extraordinary talent has been the key to unlocking his personality and social development.
If you want to inspire your family, pop some popcorn and sit everyone down to watch this excellent piece of journalism. If your kids are like mine, it will cause a great family discussion about the definition of ""disability"" and the extraordinary ability of the human brain and spirit. It may even give you the perfect answer the next time your child says he or she ""can't"" do something. Now that's priceless.
