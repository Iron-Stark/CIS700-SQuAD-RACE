The Internet came a little later than computers. It is about twenty-five years later than computers. But now it can be found almost everywhere. We can use it to read books, send e-mails, do some shopping, play games or make friends.               21*cnjy*com
Young men, especially the middle school students like the Internet very much. They often go into the Internet bars as soon as they are free. They make friends on the Internet and maybe they have never seen these friends. They don't know their names, ages and sex . They are so interested in making the ""unreal friends"" that they can't put their heart into study. Some of them play the games in the Internet bars all day and all night. Many of them can't catch up with others in many subjects because of that.
