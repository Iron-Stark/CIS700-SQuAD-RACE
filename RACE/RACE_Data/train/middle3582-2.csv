2,B,"['phone call', 'present', 'person', 'letter']","The American thought ""a ring"" should be a   _  .","Like most English children, I learned foreign languages at school. When I made my first visit to the United States, I was sure I could have a nice and easy holiday without any language problem. But how wrong I was!
At the American airport, I was looking for a public telephone to tell my friend Danny that I had arrived. An American asked if he could help me. ""Yes,"" I said, ""I want to give my friend a ring.""
""Well, that's nice. Are you getting married?"" he asked.
""No,"" I replied, ""I just want to tell him I have arrived.""
""Oh,"" he said, ""there is a phone downstairs on the first floor.""
""But we're on the first floor now,"" I said.
""Well, I don't know what you are talking about. Maybe you aren't feeling too well after your journey,"" he said. ""Just go and wash up, and you will feel a lot better."" And he went off, leaving me wondering where on earth I was: At home we wash up after a meal to get the cups and plates clean. How can I wash up at an airport?
At last we did meet. Danny explained the misunderstanding: Americans say ""to give someone a call"", but we English say ""to give somebody a ring"". When we say ""to wash your hands"", they say ""to wash up"". And Englishmen start numbering from the ground floor so the first floor is the second for Americans.",middle3582.txt
