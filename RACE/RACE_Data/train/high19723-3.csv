3,B,"['There is nothing tasting as good as sweets.', 'It is worthwhile to resist food to look skinny.', 'Nobody can resist the desire for sweets.', 'Nothing tastes good when the skin feels terrible.']",What does the sentence by Kate Moss mean?,"Can you resist cream cakes?

Not having treats can be good for your health. I've heard that the Burts, a family of five in South East England, lived sugar free for a whole year after they found out their daughter had diabetes  . It wasn't easy. To avoid temptation, I don't go to any bakeries, but this family actually owns one, which makes up to 3,000 cakes a week.
And how does it feel to live without sugar for a while? Jason Burt said that for a month they felt weak. But later on it all changed. He says he feels ""more awake"" and full of energy.
And what about the Burt family business? It had to keep using half a ton of sugar a week and any cook worth his salt knows that you have to taste a recipe to know if it's right. No problem there, says Jason Burt's wife, Clare. She points out that she's got lots of people offering to taste the cakes for them. The family is also thinking about selling more delicious products.
I wonder what makes us have a strong desire for sweet food. Anyway, I've decided to forget about the sweet taste of sugar for a while. As British model Kate Moss says: ""Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.""",high19723.txt
