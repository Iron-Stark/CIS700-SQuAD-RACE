3,D,"['Because he wants to show himself off', 'Because he wants to tell parents and other teachers what teenagers really need', 'Because he wants to show that his students are all kind and polite', ""Because he doesn't want to leave that school""]","Why does the author mention the ""Thank you"" notes  _  ?","Having a bit of a temper tantrum , whether at home or in the classroom, is as harmful as you can get and only serves to discourage your teenagers.
What they really need at this stage in their lives are words that build them up according to their needs that it may benefit them-that is, words of encouragement, affirmation  and a good deal of praise. The benefits to them and us as parents and teachers are quite amazing-harmony, peace and love.
When I left my last school where I had been a casual  for eight years, I received ""thank you"" notes from the students. I think these notes illustrate what teenagers want and need from their parents and teachers.
Some of the notes mention kindness, patience, thoughtfulness, encouragement and fun. Teenagers value these qualities and what I found was that the more I relaxed and enjoyed their company, the less I had to discipline them.
Below I've included a few excerpts from the notes to let the kids speak for themselves. These are teenagers speaking from the heart and show what, according to teenagers, they need and value.
Each note began, ""Thank you for...""
* making each student in the school happy
* putting up with us every time you get us (i.e. having patience)
* Always giving every student a chance and treating everyone like an adult giving lots
of merits and making every lesson fun and enjoyable
* Being very kind & for giving me lots of (merit) stickers
* You make working be fun
* Being a patient and thoughtful teacher
Patience is needed as well as kindness, thoughtfulness, a sense of humor and fun and the ability to listen more than talk.
When we praise and value our teenagers, the results are nothing short of miraculous.",high9162.txt
