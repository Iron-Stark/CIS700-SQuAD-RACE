2,C,"['It was in North Carolina.', 'It was good farmland.', 'It was close to their old home.', 'There were a few houses near it.']",Which of the following is NOT true about their new home?,"Some years went by. Then Father Boone called the family together. ""Pack your things,"" he told them. ""We are leaving here. Our farmland isn't good to live on. We can buy rich, cheap land in he southwest.""
Sixteen-year-old Daniel was happy. ""I'm glad we are going,"" he said. ""I feel crowded here. There are too many houses and too many people."" Father Boone made ready for the journey. He pushed out the big wagon   and tied two horses to it. Mother Boone packed clothes, dishes, pots and pans. She would make food for the family along the way. The family said goodbye to the neighbors and to their old home, and started.
Mother, the girls, and the little children rode in the wagon. Father and the boys took turns riding the horses. Sometimes all of the Boones walked so that the horses could rest.
Father and the boys had guns to kill birds and small animals for food along the way. The
Boones traveled across Pennsylvania. At last the family came to the green Yadkin Valley in North
Carolina. There were a few houses there already, but the farmland was much broader than that in
Pennsylvania.
Father Boone said, ""This is good farmland. We will stop here.""",middle2827.txt
