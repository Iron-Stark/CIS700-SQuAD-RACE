Good, work hard and get learning. Don't forget to listen to young professional's advice about the ""real world"" you're stepping into.
1. Keep up with current events.
In school, it's easy to live in a cocoon, where you focus on studies and social life. But in the working world, not knowing who Alan Greenspan is or why North Korea is in the news so often can lead to potentially embarrassing conversations.
2. Consider living with parents, even if you have a job.
Think it over before you rule it out. Not only can you save a lot of money by living at home, but your parents may provide emotional support that you may need. They can help pave the way for you to move once you are settled into your new life.
3. Don't compare yourself to other people your age.
Young adults are good at putting up impressive appearance, but you don't really know what their lives are like. Those who seem to have the perfect job may spend part of the day making coffee and picking up boss's dry-cleaning.
4. Pay attention to small jobs as well as big ones.
Don't stress if, in your first job or internship , you get a lot more face time with the copy machine than with clients. You may wonder why you spent so much time studying in school only to do such tasks. But you may also be learning more about your new professional than you realize.
5. Know when it's time to move on.
Give a new job a chance, perhaps a year, before you make up your mind to leave, especially if it's your first job out of school. When you're sure that the job isn't for you, figure out what you want to do and how to do it.
