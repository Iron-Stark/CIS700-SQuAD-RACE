Professor Nigel Wilson, of the civil and environmental engineering department of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he was ""supportive to the limiting of private cars during the Olympic Games"", saying that in foreign countries, the method is also adopted during big events, but he was unsure about the approach. 
The government planned to keep an average of more than one million cars off the roads to improve traffic flow during the Olympics, said Liu Xiaoming, deputy director of the Beijing Traffic Committee, at the China Planning Network First Urban Transportation Congress. 
Sharing Wilson's view, Dr. Yoshitsugu Hayashi, dean of the Graduate School of Environmental Studies of Nagoya University, believed the reduction in car use should be achieved not by banning, but through  _ .
""Drivers who don't use their private cars could be given points,"" he said, ""and the points could be exchanged for goods from online shopping."" 
Wetzel stressed limiting the use of company cars. ""Governmental officials should also be encouraged to use public transportation or ride bicycles,"" he said, adding that he himself is a bicycle-rider in London. 
Matthew Martimo, director of Traffic Engineering with Citilabs, said the bicycle was China's advantage. ""Limiting private cars is an idea worth trying but it is just a temporary solution,"" he said. ""The real cause of congestion is high density of people in Beijing and many have cars."" 
Beijing, with a population of 15 million, is home to more than three million automobiles, and the number is rising by 1,000 a day. 
Professor Wilson said the Olympic Games was a great opportunity for Beijing to think about traffic problems and develop transportation, adding that the city had already been making public transport more efficient. Beijing has promised to stretch its 114-kilometer city railway to 200 kilometers before the opening of the Olympic Games. 
""We are looking forward to borrowing Beijing's experiences and drawing from its lessons in preparation for the 2012 Olympics,"" said Wetzel.",high20079.txt
