2,C,"['Because his eyesight was not very good.', 'Because he went in the wrong direction.', 'Because there was heavy fog that morning.', 'Because he was not concentrated then.']",Why didn't Andy see the school building before he met Jennie?,"Andy loved the first grade. He loved his teacher,Mrs.Parks. He loved playing games on the playground. He loved learning about dinosaurs and the solar system  .
Every morning Andy's mother dropped him off in front of his school on South Street. One foggy morning,the traffic was so bad on South Street that she decided to drop him off behind the school. Andy walked for about ten minutes and got to the gate. He held the icy handle,but it didn't move!Using both hands,he tried his hardest and finally the gate opened.
After Andy closed the gate behind him,he looked in the direction of the teaching building. But all he could see was fog. He got to the spot where the slide had always been,but it was not there.""The slide is gone!"" he cried. He walked a little more to look for the swings,but they were not where they had always been.""The swings are gone!"" he cried again.
Andy kept walking. He was so anxious to see the school that he fell and landed on the ground. He still couldn't see the school. A terrible thought appeared in his head.""The school is gone!"" he cried sadly. No more games with Jennie,Angel and Dillon,he thought. No more reading about dinosaurs. No more watching videos on the solar system...
Suddenly the boy saw something up ahead.""It's Jennie!""he shouted. Then he saw the outline of a school building. His school was still there!He was full of excitement!
""Hi,Jennie!"" he stood up and caught up with the girl.""I couldn't see the school. I thought it was gone."" Jennie just laughed.""You're so silly."" ""What happened to the slide and the swings?"" Andy asked.
""We will have new playground equipment today,"" Jennie answered.""The old equipment was taken away last night. Don't you remember Mrs. Parks telling us about it yesterday?"" ""I guess I forgot,"" Andy said,smiling.""Anyway,I'm glad the school is here.""",high1259.txt
