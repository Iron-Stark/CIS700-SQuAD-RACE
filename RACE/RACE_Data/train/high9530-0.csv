She believed she had to work harder because she loved her father who was sick with cancer. She had to provide for his expensive medicines. Her brothers and sisters meanwhile stayed with their father most of the time. They bathed him, sang for him, spoon-fed  him or simply kept him company.
One day Martha was hurt. She overheard  her father telling her mother, ""All our children love me except Martha.""
""How can this be?"" Martha thought. ""Am I not the one killing myself in my work to have money to pay for his medicines? My brothers and sisters do not even provide their share in the expenses.""
One night, as Martha was as usual late in going home, she saw her father was lying awake. She walked close to his bedsides. Her father held her hands and said, ""I miss you. I don't have much time. Stay with me."" And she stayed with her father holding his hand the whole night.
The next morning Martha said to everybody, ""I have taken a leave of absence. I would like to be with father. I will bathe him and sing for him from now on."" Her father had a beautiful smile. He knew Martha loved him, too.
