Some seniors sing or dance but many of them perform skits  , where they make fun of their favorite teachers or their friends. For example, a group of boys may dress up and imitate  a group of their girl friends. It is all very light-hearted.The ""Senior Show"" is usually a part of Senior Week, which is a week specifically dedicated   to seniors.

The seniors also vote for one of their male and female classmates who they believe is the best-looking or funniest or most involved, etc. These are then published in the yearbook.
The yearbook is an important part of high school for seniors. It is usually dedicated to them and has all their pictures and some words from them in it. Then seniors go around and get it signed by their friends so they can always remember their time together.
