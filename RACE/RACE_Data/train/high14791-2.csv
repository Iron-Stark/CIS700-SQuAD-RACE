2,D,"['people will be free to smoke during the Beijing Olympic Games', 'only a few smokers still have the habit of offering cigarettes', 'offering cigarettes is the most effective way for socializing', 'some nonsmokers will even accept the offered cigarettes']",We can infer from the passage that  _  .,"Eat,drink and be merry. That's what Spring Festival is all about. But there are millions of people,too,who love to let happiness go up in smoke.
Offering cigarettes to guests is a traditional Chinese way of showing respect for them. A cup of tea and cigarettes are perhaps the most common way of welcoming a guest in China,especially during festive occasions.
No wonder,40 percent of the people surveyed recently said they would smoke at least twice the usual number of cigarettes during the Spring Festival because of all those gatherings and parties. Only 20 percent of the respondents said they would refuse a cigarette when offered one. Why can't the others do the same?Because they could be seen as being rude,said more than half of the respondents. Fifteen percent feared they could be taken as ""someone who cannot get along well with others"".
The Think tank Research Center for Health Development and sohu.com survey shows 61 percent Chinese think offering a cigarette is useful for socializing,and 52 percent have offered cigarettes to others. The study surveyed 3,800 people,64 percent of them men.
One third of those surveyed were smokers,out of which 57 percent said they couldn't give up smoking because of the offering and accepting culture. ""People have accepted offering cigarettes as an effective way of making friends,"" research center director Wu Yiqun says.
China has more than 350 million smokers,catering to the tobacco market that is worth 500 billion yuan. ""The survey shows we still have a lot of work to do,"" Wu says. ""Since Beijing is trying to make the Olympic Games smoke free,it is time to let people know that offering a cigarette is a bad habit and it should be given up immediately.""",high14791.txt
