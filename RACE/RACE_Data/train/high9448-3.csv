3,A,"['Most Oscar Winners Live Longer Lives', 'How to Get a Long Life', 'A New Study about Long Lives', 'An Amazing Finding']",What would be the best title for the passage?,"Want to live longer? Win an Oscar.
A new study says that actors who received the award earn more than larger paychecks.
So when 94-year-old Katharine Hepburn once remarked that she was respected internationally ""like an old building"", she had no idea that her four Oscars directly influenced her longevity .
The study says winning actors will live 3.9 years longer than their losing counterparts  . Actors who have won more than once, like Hepburn, live up to six years longer than those who were nominated   but never won.
""We found that they died from the same things we all die from--cancer, heart disease, but they fought them a bit longer and diseases came a bit later,"" says Dr. Donald Redelmeier, the leading author of the study. Redelmeier says the sense of success and satisfaction makes one's soul become more full of life.
""We are not saying that you will live longer if you win an Oscar,"" explains Redelmeier, ""or that people should go out and take acting courses. Our main conclusion is simply that social factors are important."" The study's implied conclusion, he says, is that doctors should ask about their patients' personal feelings because mental well-being is related to physical health.
Redelmeier says he got the idea for the study when he watched a glowing Gwyneth Paltrow win an Oscar in 1999 for her role in Shakespeare in Love. Redelmeier says, ""She looked more full of life than anyone I had seen.""
""We found, too, those that had multi-nominations and no win had the same life expectancy as those with just a single nomination and no win,"" Redelmeier adds.",high9448.txt
