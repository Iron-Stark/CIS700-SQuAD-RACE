Experts said the relics are dated more than 300 years earlier than the famous warriors   in Shaanxi Province. What excited the experts were two other projects that located two huge pits with similar features.
""It is absolutely a miracle. These relics indicate that there could be a tomb group in this area, which is likely to be important for China's archaeological   studies,"" said Ma Juncai, a leading relic researcher in the province.
In ancient China, carts, sheep, spoons and so on were buried to ensure that dead people had a happy afterlife. The number and quality of the sacrifices indicated the social status of the dead. The custom was carried into the Qin Dynasty.
