1,D,"['with Fang', 'with his friends', 'with his parents', 'alone']",Two months ago Harry came to London   _  .,"Dear Fang,
How are you these days? I have been in England for two months. It's not a long time for a newcomer, and there are still a lot of things to do. Sorry for not being able to write to you soon.
London is an old but beautiful city. There are lots of places of interest to visit. Last weekend I went along Thames River with some friends from Japan, Korea and some other countries. The modern skyscrapers  among the old buildings impressed(...) us deeply. The classes started two weeks after I arrived here alone. Besides the language, I'm trying to learn about the culture as well. British people are quite different from the Chinese. Do you know the people here do not shake hands as much as we do in China? And it's never a good habit to make noise when you eat. They think it's impolite.
There is so much to say, but I have to stop.
I will write to you soon again.
Love,
Harry",middle1002.txt
