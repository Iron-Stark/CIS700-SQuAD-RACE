2,B,"['helped the men to divide the money', 'kept two dollars for himself', 'kept three dollars for himself', 'returned three dollars to the men and two to the manger']",The assistant  _  .,"Mr. Knight was the manager of a hotel. One weekend all of the hotels in the city were full because there was a large meeting. On Friday, three men came into the hotel and asked for rooms. Mr. Knight said there were no rooms ready because of the meeting. The men were unhappy.
Mr. Knight wanted to help them. He remembered that Room 418, a small room, was empty. He asked them if they could share a room. The three men said they would. Mr. Knight said the room would be thirty dollars; ten dollars for each person. Each man gave him the money and then went up to the room.
Mr. Knight soon began to feel sorry. ""Thirty dollars is a lot to ask as a price for that small room."" he thought. He called his assistant over and said, ""Here is five dollars. Take it to the men in Room 418. I asked too much for their room.""
The assistant took the money. While he was on the way there, he started to think, ""How can three men divide five dollars? I'll give them each only one dollar and keep the two dollars for myself. The men will be happy to get something back. And Mr. Knight will never know."" So the assistant returned one dollar to each man.
Each man had at first paid ten dollars. After the assistant returned them one dollar each, each had actually(in fact) paid nine. There were three men. $9 3=""$27."" The assistant kept$2. $27+$2=""$29."" Where is the missing dollar?",high2022.txt
