0,B,"['The disappointment for both businessmen and lovers.', 'The cold reacting of the public to Qixi Festival.', 'The failure to make traditional Chinese festivals legal.', 'The action to preserve culture and traditional festivals.']",What makes Chinese cultural experts worry that the lovers' festival is dying out?,"Qixi Festival, the Chinese equivalent of Valentine's Day that fell yesterday, was not only a disappointment for forgotten lovers, but also for businessmen left with empty pockets.
The cold reception has prompted cultural experts to seriously worry that the lovers' festival, marked for generations since the Han Dynasty(206 BC-AD 220),is dying out. Some have even called for legislation to make the festival a legal --Chinese Lovers' Day, which falls on the seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar year.
But the effectiveness of such a measure is in doubt, although efforts to preserve traditional festivals deserve highly praise.
A growing number of traditional Chinese festivals, such as the Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn
Festival, share the same fate of the Qixi Festival.
Young people are showing less interest in traditional culture as symbolized by these festivals.Even if all traditional festivals are finally made legal, the risk of them becoming purely formalized celebrations with little meaning is not removed.If the younger generation fails to identify with the cultural significance of these holidays, there is little that can be done.
While complaining about traditional festivals' fading appeal, decision-makers should reflect on cultural protection. Undeniably, our country has done a bad job of preserving culture and traditional festivals, compared to neighbouring Japan and the Republic of Korea(ROK).
The 2,500-year-old Dragon Boat Festival falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. The traditional customs and ceremonies of the occasion, which originated in China, have been better preserved in the ROK.
Only a few years ago did China begin to realize the significance of preserving intangible cultural heritage when the ROK planned to apply to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to list its version of the Dragon Boat Festival as an important example of intangible culture.
Concern about the traditional holidays also reminds people of the growing influence of foreign cultures as the country opens wider to the outside world. With traditional festivals becoming less important and imports such as Christmas and Valentine's Day gaining widespread popularity, the public including cultural professionals have tended to measure traditional Chinese festivals in economic terms.
Business rather than culture has begun to play a dominant role. More and more people are preoccupied with how much money can be made during the holidays.
In fact what makes traditional festivals unique and what keeps them alive is their cultural elements. After all, it is unique culture that contributes to the world's diversity with globalization.",high9662.txt
