2,C,"['About five minutes.', 'About fifteen minutes.', 'About ten minutes.', 'About thirty minutes.']",How long did the young man wait for?,"Have you ever done something foolish that made you feel so embarrassed ?
Well, that's exactly how I felt. On a Saturday morning last autumn.I had gone to town to do some shopping and as I was on my way home,it suddenly began to rain. I at once ran into a nearby phone box because I didn't have an umbrella.It was raining so heavily that I have to stay in the phone box until it stopped.
A few moments later,I saw a young man walk up to the phone box,wearing a yellow raincoat and holding a box. I didn't want to go out into the rain,so I picked up the phone and pretended  I was talking to someone. I thought the man would go away,but he didn't. He just waited in the rain,watching me. I had to wave my hands about and acted as if I was deep in conversation.
Luckily,it began to stop after about ten minutes.""Okay,Mum,"" I said loudly into the phone,""I'll see you later Bye!"" I put the phone down, picked up my shopping bag and walked out of the phone box ""I'm sorry I took so long,""I said to the man.
""Oh, I don't want to use the phone,""he replied, smiling.""I've just come to repair it. It's out of order.you see."" I felt myself go red in the face and I hurried away with my head down,feeling a complete fool. That was certainly one of the most embarrassing moments of my life!",high8108.txt
