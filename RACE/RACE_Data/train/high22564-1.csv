So you're about to spend four years of your life and tens of dollars of your parents' money, and all 
you really know about college is that all of your friends are going. Do you ever stop to wonder why 
you're going? 
*Relax. You're making the right decision. First of all, you'll discover what interests you by taking 
courses in many subjects. For example, it's hard to decide if you want to be a painter if you've never 
painted any pictures; once you're in a drawing-room on campus, you'll know one way or the other. 
College is also a lot of fun--after you graduate, you'll be working every weekday for 50 or so years. 
And remember that college graduate earn about twice the income of those who never attended college. 
*Finding the right college can be difficult. Fortunately, Johnson Review is here to help you every 
step of the way. 
*Researching Schools. To us, the most important decision you'll make is to choose the school that 
really fits you best -- not the one that is the most competitive or has the best-equipped rooms. 
*Applying to School. On JohnsonReview.com., you'll find hundreds of actual college applications
and links to many more. 
*Raising Your Scores. American College Test is one of the most important parts of the admission
course. It's not the most important, though, and everyone needs to prepare for the best. But, if you can do better, find the right course for better scores. 
*Paying for School. Most families need financial aid for the high cost of college. The problem is 
that financial aid seems difficult to get and many families get caught up in the price of college rather than learning the ways to get financial aid. If you really do your research, you'll learn that you can afford to attend any college, no matter the cost.
