But now scientists have found that the season of birth also plays a role.
Scientists from Budapest, Hungary, studied 400 university students. In the study, the students needed to finish a questionnaire  . The purpose of it was to find out which of four kinds of temperaments they most had. From the questionnaire, scientists found that the students always answered something like ""My mood often changes for no reason"" and ""I love to deal with new projects, even if it is risky"".

They discovered that people born in summer easily change between sad and happy moods compared to people born in winter. Those who always feel positive are mostly born in spring and summer.
The study also found that those born in autumn less probably had a mood of _ which may easily drive them to cry, while those born in winter were not easier to be angry.
Scientists said that this was probably because the seasons had an influence on certain chemicals in the human body. And the chemicals are important to control people's moods even in adult life.
