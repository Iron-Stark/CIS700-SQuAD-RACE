0,B,"['for quite a long time', 'first by beachgoers', 'to prevent swimmers drowning', 'in honor of the movie Spiderman']","The ""face-kini"" has been worn in Qingdao -  _  '","Perhaps drawing inspiration from Spiderman, beachgoers in China' s eastern city of Qingdao have come up with a new way of protecting their skin from the sun. They call it the ""face-kini"". It was first sported by middle-aged women as a practical addition to their swimsuits, but now the face-kini has gone global.
New York-based style magazine CR Fashion Book, founded by former Vogue Paris editor Carine Roitfeld, recently published a photo shoot of models with pouting  red lips, wearing face-kinis, chic swimsuits and fancy jewellery .
The transformation of what' s considered the symbol of ""old woman style"" in China to high fashion has amused Internet users. In two days, the subject was widely spread on the Chinese Twitter, Weibo.
""Chinese old women are at the centre of the global fashion world,"" said one comment. ""It looks like bank robbers attacking the beach,"" others joked.
When it comes to avoiding the sun, it seems Chinese creativity is unlimited. Apart from the face-kini, the Chinese use special UV-blocking sun umbrellas which can be attached to bike handles.
There are also sun- blocking removable sleeves and Batman- style capes. The list goes on. On Chinese television, commercials for magic whitening creams are everywhere. White is seen as beautiful here, or as the old Chinese saying goes: ""One touch of white covers 100 kinds of ugliness.""
It' s a curious contrast to the fact that people in many western countries pay for tanning .
Tanning salons are just now starting to take off in big Chinese cities, where western influences are deeper.
Liu Yupu, or ""China tanning boss"" as he goes by on Weibo, took the sudden popularity of face- kinis with a pinch of salt. He said: ""These days, if you had just been to a tanning salon in China. Your parents and close friends may call you an idiot, but you'll also get plenty of praise."" But can a beautifully-tanned woman turn as many heads as the face-kini on the Qingdao beach?",high13477.txt
