2,D,"['All', 'Many', 'Some', 'Few']",_   of the students can get real friends online.,"These days many students like to make friends online. Most of them think it's interesting to know an unknown person through the Internet. So, many students like to use computers to talk with those friends. And they spend too much time on it. Some of them can not do well in their school work. Their parents often don't think the children are as good as before. So many teachers and parents are worried about their children.
In fact, only very few of them can get real good friends in this way. Most of them were _ by those unseen friends. And some of the students did wrong things online. It's terrible for students to use too much time to make friends and talk online.
So we should be careful of making friends online and should not spend too much time on it.  We'd better pay more attention to study. We will be really happy when we do well in school and at home.",middle4766.txt
