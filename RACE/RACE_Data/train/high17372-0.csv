0,B,"['Mike Litman.', 'Marco Dorigo.', 'The Master Creator.', 'James Allen.']",Who spent time imagining what he planned to do every night before going to bed?,"How many times have you heard the expression that most people spend more time planning their vacation than they do planning their lives. I would explain that expression by adding that most people spend more time ""thinking"" about their vacation than they do thinking about what's important in their life. 
While rest and relaxation are a must in living a balanced life, it's not what we were created to do. After all, the Master Creator took his R&R (Rest and Recreation) on the seventh day, only after six days of ""definitely directed thought."" 1
My friend Mike Litman wrote an article this week. 2It's called ""The Millionaire Composite"" and it analyzes one of the big differences between super-successful people and everyone else. He wrote ""I recently visited a Real Estate Multi Millionaire Mogul. What did I see next to his desk? His vision   statement, along with a list of what he values in life-handwritten.""
""A few months back, I interviewed an individual Marco Dorigo who sold over a billion dollars worth of products on television. He told me that he read his life and business vision and goals daily, and that he took time to imagine exactly what he wanted to create each night before falling asleep.""
What is your life's purpose or your personal task statement? Is it written down? Do you review it and think about it often? 3Is your life organized around your purpose and a set of goals that support that purpose?
Without purpose and goals - certainly directed thought-you are like ""ship without a rudder. "" There is power in your purpose and in your goals.4
One of my favorite passages of James Allen is one he wrote in The Mastery of Destiny:
""All successful people are people of purpose. They hold fast to an idea, a project, a plan, and will not let it go; they treasure it and develop it; and when upset by difficulties, they refuse to give in; the greater the difficulties are, the stronger the purpose is. "" And that's worth thinking about.",high17372.txt
