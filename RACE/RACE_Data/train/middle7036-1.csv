After school, Andy walked by the sports shop on the street corner. He stopped to look at the tennis bats in the shop window, and then turned over and walked away.
Tomorrow was his birthday. He really wanted to have such tennis bats for his birthday gift. But when he thought of his parents he felt sorry for himself. They would like to give him what he likes. But they were both out of work for a long time. Hanging out in the street, Andy didn't want to go home. Sorry and tired, he sat in the street corner.
""What are you doing here, Andy?"" cried his brother Michael.
""Dad was badly hurt and he is in hospital now,"" his brother said sadly and loudly. When they arrived, dad was lying in bed with white cloth on the head.
