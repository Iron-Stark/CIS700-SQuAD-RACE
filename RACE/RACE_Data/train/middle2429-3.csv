3,A,"['to believe in our dreams and never give up', 'how to help people', 'how to have a happy and easy life', 'that it is good to help other people']",The writer mainly wants to tell us  _  .,"When I was in the eighth grade, my teacher asked us to write an article about what we would like to do when we grew up. All I could think of was one sentence I want to help other people! During the years, I met many problems. But I never gave up. I know that to help other people I have to help myself first. I encouraged myself after I experienced failures . Finally .my dream really came true. I found a part-time job in a charity. I began to spend my days doing things for people. I have a happy life. That doesn't mean that this kind of life is easy, or that my work is always enjoyable. I an happy because I an doing what I want to do.
What do you want to do? Write it down now. If you don't know, you can ask yourself, ""What would I do if this was the last day of my  life ?"" Then write down the first thing that comes to your mind, no matter  how silly or impossible it is. If you have an answer, you will know what your dream is.",middle2429.txt
