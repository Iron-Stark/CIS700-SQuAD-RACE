0,B,"['They tell others news stories from place to place on foot or by horse.', 'They learn about news stories by watching TV or reading newspapers.', 'They tell each other what they have seen with their eyes.', 'They listen to the radio every day to get some information.']","According to the passage, how do people learn about news stories in the world now?","Hundreds of years ago, news was carried from place to place by people on foot or by horse. It took days, weeks and sometimes months for people to receive news. Now it is possible to send words and pictures around the world in seconds. Billions of people learn about news stories of their own country and all over the world every day either by watching TV or reading newspapers.
Newspapers have been an important part of everyday life since the 18th century. Many countries have hundreds of different newspapers. How do newspaper editors  decide which news stories to print? Why do they print some stories and not others? What makes a good newspaper story?
Firstly, it is important to report new stories. TV stations can report news much faster than newspapers, but newspapers give more about the same story. They may also look at the story in another way, or they may print completely different stories from those on TV.
Secondly, a new story has to be interesting and unusual. People don't want to read stories about everyday life. As a result, many stories are about some kinds of danger and seem to be ""bad"" news. For example, newspapers never print stories about planes landing safely, instead they print stories about air crashes.",middle7790.txt
