0,C,"['Excited.', 'Bored.', 'Worried.', 'Surprised.']",How does the writer feel about exams?,"Very few people enjoy exams. I don't, either. And although I tell myself not to worry about them, I always do! So I'm not surprised that my students worry about them, too, even though they usually don't need to. Because they are afraid of failing. However, since it is hard not to worry at all, we all must try not to worry too much. Why? Because worrying makes exams worse! How to do this?
Ask the teacher about how to revise and about exam skills--how to work when you are in the exam. Good students don't wait until the week before an exam. They study all through the year. It is not possible to learn everything at the last minute. So don't leave it till then.
If you start planning and working for each exam early and you make sure that you understand what you're studying, then, when it is over, you'll be able to say, ""What a good exam that was!""
Take a short rest during your time of work and revision. If your mind is tired, it won't remember well. Work at the time when you know you'll work at your best.
If you're studying in the evening, don't go straight to bed afterwards. Your mind will still be ""going round and round""--thinking too much. Do something else, maybe walk or get exercise. Choose something that will relax you, and make you think of other things.
If you feel bad, talk to someone about your worries. But don't be too relaxed! Some stress over exams makes you work hard for them.",middle1215.txt
