You can join one group. As a member of the group, you will take part in at least ONE of the following activities.
1Compete in an Olympic event. Remember there is only small space for each event, so don't be late.
 Hercules Throw. Throw a football through a hoop  20 feet away.
 Three Headed Race Three people line up with touching legs tied. Then they run 100 metres in the playground.
 Toga Barrow Race This is like a wheelbarrow race. (Runners take hold of partners feet while partners walk on hands.)
2Make Greek or Roman food. Mrs Jones has a list of recipes  from ancient  Greece and Rome. You may make American food, but be sure to give it a special, mythological  name. For example, call your chocolate cake ""Zeus's Delight."" This is a great way to practice your skills in the kitchen.
3Create a work of art for the museum. Be sure your artwork shows ancient Greek or Roman culture. Artworks may include sculptures, paintings, mosaics, drawings or models. The museum is a great place to show off your artistic talent.
4Perform a new short performance, song or dance for the talent show. Rewrite your favorite Greek myth  by using modern language, or change the words of a popular song to tell a Greek or Roman story. Send your creative ideas to your English teacher for agreement. You must first perform for a group of teachers. The teachers choose the BEST performance groups for the talent show, so be sure your group has prepared for it.
This timetable will help groups know when each event will take place and where to go.
