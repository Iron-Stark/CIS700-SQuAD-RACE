Each student was given 36 cards, and each card listed a topic that teens sometimes lie about to their parents, The researchers worked through the cards with the teens, learning what things the kid was lying to his parents about, and why.
By the end of the interviews, the kids saw for the first time how much they were lying and how many of family's rules they had broken. It was reported that 98% of the teens had lied to their parents.
Out of the 36 topics, the average  teen was lying to his parents about 12 of them. The teens lied about what movie they went to, and whom they went with .They lied about how they spent their afternoons while their parents were at work, and something like that.
