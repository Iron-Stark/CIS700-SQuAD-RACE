My town is a great place to live in . It's the best place to enjoy your free time. There are three movie theaters in the town. They are all good, but the one nearest my house is the best. Shopping is also easy, There are many shops and most of them are trendy. They sell very fashionable clothes. The prices are also cheaper than in other cities, so students love to shop here. There are also a lot of video and music stores. These are very popular with students. I go to the music store every week to buy a new CD. The most crowded place for students to hang out is the park . Everyone goes there ,so it's really interesting.
Sometimes there are even street performers. Some students think they are boring ,but I think they are the most creative people. I want to be a street performer, too .",middle1950.txt
