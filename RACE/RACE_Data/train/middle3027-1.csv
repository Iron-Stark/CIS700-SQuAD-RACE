1,A,"['grocery', 'vegetable', 'fruit', 'grain']",The shop is a   _   shop.,"I work in a small shop. It is near a factory. Every day, workers, old ladies and housewives come to the shop to buy things.
I live in a house not very far from the shop. I usually get up at six, have breakfast and then go to work by bike. I take some food along in my lunch box.
I get to the shop at about ten to seven. At seven customers  begin to arrive. They buy meat, eggs, sugar, soybean, sauce, cooking oil  , salt, candies, biscuits and many other things. We don't sell  vegetables or fruit. There is a shop for these things nearby. I have my meal at noon from my lunch box. At seven in the evening we close the shop. I tidy things up and then go home for supper.
Some people may think my work isn't so interesting. But I do my bit for the modernizations , don't I?",middle3027.txt
