At first, Eijkman thought some kind of germ   caused beri-beri. He raised some chickens. He didn't eat them, but made experiments on them. The local people were quite surprised at that. One day he noticed that his chickens became sick when they were fed the food most Javanese ate -- refined white rice  . When he fed them with unrefined rice, also known as brown rice, they recovered.
