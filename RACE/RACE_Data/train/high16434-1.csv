Using the same technology as a dehumidifier  , the Water Mill is able to create a ready supply of drinking water by getting it from a limitless source-the air. The company behind the machine says not only does it offer all alterative to bottled water in developed countries,but it is a solution for the millions who face a daily water shortage.
The machine works by drawing in damp air through a filter  and over a cooling element which changes it into water droplets.It can produce up to 12 liters a day.The Water Mill will also produce more water when storms pass over, as the humidity in the air increases.In keeping with its ecodevelopment,the machine uses the same amount of electricity as three light bulbs.
