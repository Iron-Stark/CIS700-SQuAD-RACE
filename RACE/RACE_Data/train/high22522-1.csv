1,C,"['A commercial robot', 'A robot produced by Japan', 'A human-like robot', 'A dancing robot']",Which is the best title for this passage?,"Scientists have created a""human-like robot""that can dance and do the housework. 
    ""Mahru"" has been developed to imitate humans and can move its lips, eyes and eyebrows. The machine can also move its upper and lower body freely and automatically stop itself when walking. In addition, it has been programmed to give out two kinds of pleasant smells to match its emotions. 
       The 1.5m tall robot was produced by researchers at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology(KIST)and is the first South Korean-developed machine of its kind. ""Mahru will open the way for the commercial use of humanoid robots doing housework,"" You Bum-Jae, leader of the development researchers team, said, ""Mahru can dance while walking on its legs and is able to work in place of a human."" Through an advanced action capture system, Mahru can follow a variety of human movements and is able to move its hands freely enough to cope with any obstacles that may get in his way when walking.
       State-funded KIST showed the robot during a presentation at its headquarters in Seoul. People were treated to an entertaining show which saw the robot show off the full range of its skills, a series of dance moves. 
    The research team added that they had designed another ""Mahru"", this time with sensors allowing it to distinguish between faces and objects. 
     The showing of ""Mahru"" came a week after researchers in Japan said they had created the ""most human-like"" robot in the world. A team at robotics department of Osaka University in Japan said that ""robotgirl"", Replee R-l, looks, moves and interacts like a human, and has silicone  skin that feels almost human to the touch.",high22522.txt
