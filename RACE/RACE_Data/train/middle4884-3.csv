3,C,"['rabbit', 'bee', 'bird', 'fish']",_  can make several different sounds.,"Animals, including insects , don't have a 'language' like ours. They do not 'talk' to  each other in words and sentences . But if we watch them, we can see that they  have their ways of communicating  with each other.
Can you see the rabbit's tail? When rabbits see this white tail moving up and down, they run away. They know that they are in danger. The rabbit  told them something without  making a sound. It has given them a signal .
Many other animals use this kind of 'language'. When a cobra  is angry, it raises its head and makes itself look powerful . This warns other animals. When a bee  found some food, it goes back to its home. It cannot 'tell' the other bees where the food is by speaking to them, but it does a little dance. This tells the bees where the food is.
Some animals 'say' things by making sounds. A dog barks, for example, when a stranger comes near. A cat purrs when it is pleased. Some birds make several different sounds, evry sound has its own meaning. Sometimes we human beings  speak in the same way. We make sounds like""Oh"" or ""Ah"" when we are afraid or happy or when we drop something on our toes.",middle4884.txt
