This month, we had to choose an optional activity. Should it really be called ""optional"" if you have to do it? Unfortunately, I waited until the last minute to sign up. Many of the activities were already full, but I made a decision to join the Cooking Club because at least that way I would get a snack to eat.

It was the first time to be here. Like many of my ideas, joining the Cooking Club made sense at first but was turning out to be a disaster. Most people have been in the club for more than a year, so they already know what they're doing. And since they all know each other, they weren't exactly interested in a newcomer.

What a terrible day! How could I know that if a recipe says to beat cookie batter  , you couldn't do it with your fists  ? I thought the other kids would never stop laughing. And it was not easy to get cookie batter off your clothes.

I have more funny things in Cooking Club. Now I know that chocolate mousse is a dessert and it isn't spelled m-o-o-s-e. ""Mousse"" and ""Moose""   sound exactly the same. So I don't think my question about whether vegetarians  can eat chocolate mousse was really that silly.

One of my bright ideas worked out for a change! Everyone laughed when I handed out the chocolate ""moose"" cookie that I made yesterday, but this time I was laughing, too. The peanut butter antlers  were a _ . We're even planning to bake more cookies for the school food festival next week.",middle7655.txt
