They are based on his experience of building a company from the ground  up, leading New York City as mayor , and so on.
Take Risks
Life is too short to spend your time avoiding failure.
In 1981, at the age of 39, I lost my job. The next day I took a big risk and began my own company. In 2001, when I was debating whether to run for mayor, most people advised me not to do it. But one person said, ""If you can imagine yourself giving a concession speech, then why not go for it?"" That was the best advice I received, and I followed it.
In order to succeed, you must first be willing to fail-- and you must have the  courage to go for it anyway.
Make your own luck
Luck plays a part in success. The harder you work, the luckier you get.
Whatever you choose to do, even if it's not the job of your dreams, always work hard at it. Be the first person at work in the morning and the last to leave at night. Hard work creates chances.
Never stop learning
The most powerful word in English language is ""why"". There is nothing so powerful
as an open, inquiring mind . Whatever field you choose for starting a business -- be a lifelong student.
Give back
You are responsible for your success and failure, but you only succeed if you share the reward with others.
My first donation was a $ 5 check to my alma mater   . And while the checks may be bigger today, they come with the same spirit.
You don't have to be wealthy to give back. You can give back by giving your time  and talents.",middle7600.txt
