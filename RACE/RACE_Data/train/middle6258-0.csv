He ate a few and placed the rest under his bed. After lunch, he found the box was gone. He went to tell his camp coach  about it.
The next day, the coach saw a boy eating Tom's biscuits behind a tree. He came up with an idea to solve the problem. He found Tom and said to him, ""I know who took away your biscuits. Will you help me to teach him a lesson?""
""Well, yes... are you going to punish him, sir?"" Tom asked. ""No, I'm not,"" the coach explained patiently. ""That would only make him hate you. I want you to write to your mother and ask for more gifts.""
Tom received another box of biscuits by mailing from his mother a few days later. ""Now,"" said the coach, ""go and share them with the boy who stole your biscuits."" Tom didn't understand the coach's intention , but he still followed his suggestion.
Half an hour later the coach saw the two boys come up the hill, arm in arm. The boy was trying to ask Tom to accept his toy robot in payment for  the stolen biscuits. And Tom was refusing the gift from his new friend. He said that a few biscuits were not so important.
