0,A,"['Sunny.', 'Windy.', 'Rainy.', 'Snowy.']",How will the weather be if birds are flying high in the sky?,"What will the weather be like in the future? Some people say they can know the weather from animals.
If birds are flying high in the sky, there will be a nice day. When they sit in trees or stay close together, bad weather is on the way. Ants often build their homes on the steep   side just before the rain comes. Cats like to clean their ears before the rain. Chickens make a loud noise and run here and there when the rain is coming. Frogs will stay in the water and make a lot of noise, too. But on a nice day, they are quiet and jump out of the water. Turtles   often look for higher ground and cows like to lie down when the rain is on the way.",middle2839.txt
