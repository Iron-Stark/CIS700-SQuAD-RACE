3,A,"['Every cloud has a silver lining.', 'Nothing is impossible to a willing mind.', 'First think, then act.', 'No pains, no gains.']",Which of the following can be used to describe Sarah's story?,"It was the first day of second grade, and Sarah had been looking forward to this moment. The night before, she laid out her favorite clothes: a white coat and a bright yellow shirt.
When having breakfast, Sarah dropped some food on her shirt, so she had to change into her second-best clothes, blue jeans and a Jonas Brothers T-shirt.
After breakfast Sarah rushed to catch the school bus and when she was just reaching the door the bus driver opened it. The door hit right in Sarah's face and blood dripped from her nose. The driver wanted to send her home, but she refused, ""It is the most important day of the year! I can't miss it!""
Before classes, Sarah went to her favorite swing. When rising high, she saw her best friend little Jack. She let go of the swing and waved to him with one hand. Unfortunately, she flew out of the swing and landed hard on the sand, breaking a leg and an arm. As she lay in the sand, she noticed a shiny thing on the ground beside her. With her good hand she took it.
When Sarah' mother rushed into the ward she was surprised by what she saw: her girl was lying in bed with an arm and a leg in the splint  , a broken nose, and blood stains on her second-best clothes. Expecting to see her child crying, she was confused when she saw a big, bright smile on Sarah's face.
""Sarah, look at you!"" her mother cried. ""You were hurt so badly and why are you smiling?""
""Look, Mommy, I found a diamond!"" Sarah laughed.
Life can be like that. It can be tough, even painful sometimes. But there are always treasures that make the pain worth suffering.",high16515.txt
