3,A,"['Because some of the warm water turns to vapor, the amount  becomes less than that of cold water.', 'Because warm water is lighter than cold water.', 'Because the temperature of warm water is lower than that of cold water.', 'Because cold water freezes with more difficulty than warm water.']",Why does warm water freeze first in the same freezing weather?,Warm water freezes more quickly than cold water. Sir Francis Bacon said that almost four hundred years ago. But few people believed him until 1970. In that year a Canadian scientist George Kill proved the English professor was right. Dr Kill filled an open oil pail  with cold water. He filled another with warm water. He put both in the same low temperature. The warm water froze first. The lack of covers on the pails is the secret. Some of the warm water changed into vapor. This meant that less of the warm water was left to be frozen. And so the warm water froze faster than the cold water even though it had a greater temperature drop to make.,high1288.txt
