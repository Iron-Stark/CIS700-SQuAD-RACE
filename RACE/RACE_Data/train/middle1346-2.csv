2,B,"['people like to work only in big cities', ""some people don't like to live in big cities"", 'there will be no small towns in the future', 'it is better to live in cities than in villages']",We can learn from the text that   _  .,"Long, long ago there were only a few thousand people in the world. These people move form place to place over the land, hunting animals for food.
