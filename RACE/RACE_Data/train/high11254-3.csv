Reading aloud helps a cloud to read with pleasure, create background knowledge, and build vocabulary.  It also provides children with a reading model. Reading aloud doesn't just benefit young children. Parents should continue reading aloud as their children grow because listening comprehension is more important than reading skills in middle school.
