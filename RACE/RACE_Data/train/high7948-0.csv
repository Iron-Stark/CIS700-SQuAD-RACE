0,C,"['A doctor.', 'An actor.', 'A student.', 'A researcher.']",What's the author now?,"As is known, it is a respectful job to be a teacher serving students heart and soul. And most people also compare a teacher to a gardener who takes great care of various plants. Ever since my high school days, my heart has been set on becoming a teacher. I am now studying at a teacher's college, and I am making great efforts to study, because there are so many things to learn about education. But I thoroughly enjoy my studies, and every day I am amazed at the great influence education has on the human soul.
I think it is only natural that I have always _ to become a teacher because my father and his father were also teachers. My father is now retired, following a brilliant career, and it has always been his dream to have me, his only son, follow in his footsteps. Although it sounds like my father's dream that I will become a teacher, it is also my dream and I am quite willing to realize the dream. I still have one more year to go at university, and after I graduate, I will go to the western part of China to become a teacher at a village school.
I understand a teacher's job will not make me a millionaire, but it is not the prospect of making a lot of money that has propelled my ambition to become a teacher. Rather, it is my sincere desire to assume a responsible role in society, and make as many people well--educated as possible through my hard endeavors. Education plays an essential and important role in our society. If everyone can receive a good education, it will not only do good to our country but also benefit individuals' lives.
Ten years from now, therefore, I hope to be established as an excellent teacher with hundreds of thousands of students who have benefited from me and carry on the family tradition with efficiency and honour.",high7948.txt
