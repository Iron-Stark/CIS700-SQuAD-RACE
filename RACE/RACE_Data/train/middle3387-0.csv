But on May 14th, 170 students at Duncanville High School in Texas, US, were told to go back home.Why? Because they were wearing the wrong clothes to school. Schools in the US don't always ask students to wear uniforms. But they have dress codes . For example, Duncanville High School tells students to wear belts, shirts without logos  .Schools' most-hated clothes are different.
In 2011, the saggy (    ) trousers law was passed in Florida. It stops students from wearing trousers that show body parts.
Now, ""the favourite new target (   ) of the school dress code"" is leggings(    ), reported the Associated Press. Some schools don't allow leggings. Other schools ask students to wear a shirt or a skirt over leggings.
Some students complain      that schools are going too far. But schools say dress codes help protect students' safety and make sure they grow up with good taste.""We want to teach them that they must meet the expectations   not only here in school, but also outside school,"" said Andre Smith.",middle3387.txt
