""Mr. Tanaka,"" the boy finally asked, ""shouldn't I be learning more moves?""
""This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you'll ever need to know,"" his teacher replied.
Several months later, Mr. Tanaka took the boy to his first tournament  . The boy won his first three matches, using his one move to win. The boy was now in the finals, and was amazed by his own success.
This time, his opponent   was bigger, stronger, and more experienced. The referee   wanted to stop the match.
""No,"" the teacher insisted, ""let him continue."" Soon, his opponent lowered his guard. At that moment the boy used his move to pin   him. The boy won the match and became the champion.

""Mr. Tanaka, how did I win the tournament with only one move?""
""You won for two reasons,"" his teacher answered. ""First, you've almost mastered one of the most difficult throws in all of judo. And second, the only defense   for that move is for your opponent to catch your left arm.""
