3,B,"['Enthusiastic', 'Neutral', 'Critical', 'Angry']",What's the writer's attitude towards Douglas?,"Gabby Douglas stood beneath the Rio Olympic Arena, still in her Team USA leotard, trying hard to understand how she had become the most unpatriotic athlete in Rio. Tears filled in her eyes. She tried hard to talk but no words came out. Her pauses were long and uncomfortable.
""I've been trying to stay off the Internet because there's so much negativity,"" she said. The attacks against her have been everywhere these last few days. The bullies blamed her for not putting her hand over her heart while the US national song played.

All of this prompted her mother, Natalie Hawkins, to tell Reuters this weekend, that Douglas is ""heartbroken"".
