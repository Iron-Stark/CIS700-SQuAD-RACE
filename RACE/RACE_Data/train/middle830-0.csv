0,D,"['My parents divorced when I was 8 years old.', ""My parents' marriage was a mistake of World War II."", ""My mother has got cards on Father's Day."", ""I was the only child who didn't have a father at home on Father's Day.""]",Which sentence shows that divorce was very uncommon at that time?,"My parents divorced when I was 8 years old. Their marriage was a mistake of World War II. And about 50 years ago, I was the only child I knew who didn't have a father at home on Father's Day. Divorce was very uncommon back then.
So when my friends were in town shopping for presents for their fathers, I decided since my mother was both Mother and Father, no one else was like her, who better deserved(be worth) a present on Father's Day than her?
I bought her a little set of tools, just a few things, hammer, pliers  and screwdriver  and a box to put all these things in. I got some ideas from my grandfather and named it Mother's Tool Box. She was excited, more at the thought of being cared for on Father's Day than of the present. She always said she liked her Father's Day memories better than the Mother's Day ones. It made her feel special -- and she was. I have noticed in the past few years, greeting cards are even made for ""Mother on Father's Day"". Ever since then, my mother has got cards on Father's Day. By the way, she knew just how to use those tools and others she had ever used over the years.",middle830.txt
