Today let me show you around my community. In front of my apartment  , there is a very small garden with a table, four chairs and some flowers. I love taking a walk in the garden in summer.
After getting out of the garden, I can get to a big market soon. I walk past the market when I go to work every day. There are fresh vegetables, fruit and meat there. I often buy some fresh fruit there with my friends. After passing the market, I will be near the main road  . There are a lot of shops on both sides of the road, like shoe shops, clothes shops ...
After walking straight along the main road for fifteen minutes, I can see a bus stop. I only need to pay 0.5 yuan, and then I can go almost   anywhere. That's very cheap. I feel very happy to live in a community like this.",middle7720.txt
