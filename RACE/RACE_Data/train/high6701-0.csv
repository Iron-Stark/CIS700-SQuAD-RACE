0,C,"['create a sonar trap of the area', 'pick up underwater sounds', 'see if the signals detected are from the target black boxes', 'reduce the search area on the ocean floor']",The submarine will be sent deep into the Indian Ocean on Monday to   _   .,"PERTH--Search crews will send a submarine deep into the Indian Ocean on Monday for the first time to try to determine whether signals detected by sound-locating equipment are from the  missing Malaysian plane's black boxes, the Australian head of the search said.
Angus Houst on said the crew on board the Ocean Shield  will send the underwater vehicle sometime Monday evening. The Bluefin 21 submarine can create a sonar map of the area to chartany wreckage on the seafloor.
The move comes after crews picked up a series of underwater sounds over the past two weeks that were consistent with an aircraft's black boxes.
""We haven't had a single detection in six days, and l guess it's time to go under water,"" said Houston.
""Analysis of the four signals has reduced the search area on the ocean floor. The experts have therefore determined that the Australian Defense Vessel Ocean Shield will stop searching with the Towed Pinger Locator later today and use the underwater vehicle Bluefin 21 as soon as possible,"" he said at a news conference in Perth.

He said the submarine will take 24 hours to do each task, including two hours to dive, 16 hours to search the bottom, then two more hours hack up and four hours to download data.
Recovering the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders is necessary For investigators to try to figure out what happened to Flight 370, which disappeared on March 8.
Houston said the search using the submarine will be a slaw and painstaking process.
The submarine takes six times longer to cover the same area as the pinger locator,and will need about six weeks to two months to examine the present underwater zone. The signals are also coming from 4,500 meters (15,000 feet) below the surface, which is the deepest the submarine can dive.",high6701.txt
