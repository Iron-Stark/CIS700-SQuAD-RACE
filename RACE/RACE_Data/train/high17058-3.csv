3,C,"['Every woman needs a baby', 'Women are happy without children', 'Men need children more badly', 'A research about men and women']",Which of the following may be the best title for the passage?,"British researchers found that men are almost as likely as women to want children, and they feel more lonely, depressed, angry and sad than women if they don't have them. 
Childless women were more likely to mention personal wish and biological urge  as major influences, compared to men. Men were more likely to mention cultural, societal and family pressures than women. 
Robin Hadley, of Keele University, found that 59 percent of men and 63 percent of women said they wanted children. Of the men who wanted children, half had experienced loneliness because they did not have any children, compared with 27 percent of women. Thirty-eight percent of men had experienced depression because they did not have any children, compared with only 27 percent of women.
One in four men had experienced anger because they did not have any children, compared with 18 percent of women, while 56 percent of men had experienced sadness because they did not have any children, compared with 43 percent of women. However, no men had experienced guilt   because they did not have any children although 16 percent of women had. 
Mr Hadley said, ""My work shows that there was a similar level of wish for parenthood among childless men and women in the survey, and that men had higher levels of anger, depression, sadness, jealousy  and loneliness than women. This challenges the common idea that women are much more likely to want to have children than men, and that they always experience all kinds of bad emotions more deeply than men if they don't have children.""
