3,D,"['quit their jobs', 'are online a lot', 'have IAD', 'help people with IAD']",Ivan Goldberg and Kimberly S. Young  _,"Computers are good tools .The Internet is also good. But some people spend too much time online. They can't stop. Doctors say this is a new sickness. They call this sickness Internet Addiction Disorder  (IAD).
People with IAD are online a lot. They spend hours chatting to their friends or playing online games. Many people with IAD spend more time on the Internet than with family or friends. Some people with IAD even quit their jobs!
Do you have IAD? Think about these questions:How many hours a day are you online? Is it a lot or a little? When you are not online,are you thinking about playing a computer game or checking your messages? When you are online,do you forget the time? Do you get angry when you can't play a game?
If you have IAD,what can you do? Dr. Ivan Goldberg and Dr. Kimberly S.Young have some ideas. First,ask yourself ""Why am I online a lot?"" Then try to take a break. For example,use the computer or play games twice a week,not every day. In this way,you can have a good social life with other friends.",middle4017.txt
