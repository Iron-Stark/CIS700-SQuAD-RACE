0,D,"['tell us something about his work', 'tell us about a fishing experience', 'persuade us to take Grandpa fishing', 'persuade us to care about the elderly']",The writer wrote the passage mainly to   _  .,"Several years ago, I worked as a truck driver for a company. On Saturdays I usually spent several hours doing something to keep my truck in good condition.
One Saturday, as I was cleaning my truck, I noticed the boss's elderly father came out to ask his grandson to take him fishing after work. The grandson told him all about how much he would love to do that, but he just couldn't because he had other plans already. The old man hobbled   off to the house.
Then I heard the grandson telling his dad, ""I'm not taking that old man fishing! It's worse than taking a kid.""
That just broke my heart.
I _ working immediately and went home to fetch my fishing gear   and a chair. Then I came back and invited the old man to go fishing. He accepted happily.
When we got to the river, I let him sit in the chair at the edge of the water. It wasn't long before he got a fish. He got one fish after another. His eyes were shining like a child. About half an hour later, he told me he was tired and needed to go home. So I took him and the fish home.
Two weeks later, the old man died. His family told me later that all he talked about during that time was his fishing trip. I am satisfied that I have taken an old man on his last fishing trip, but I am sorry that his family have lost their last chance. Whenever you get the chance, don't forget about taking Grandpa fishing. Someday, you may be in the same place and you'll want your family to care about you, too.",high6494.txt
