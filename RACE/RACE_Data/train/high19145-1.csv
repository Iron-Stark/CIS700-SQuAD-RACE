In 1940, John and Lib Crum bought some land on Opossumtown Pike in Frederick, Maryland. They called their new home ""Crumland Farms"", and started milking a dozen cows by hand. By the time their son, Denny, and his wife Judy sold off the animals 60 years later, over 600 cows were being milked 3 times a day! The dairy  operation may be gone, but Crumland is still a working farm. The family grows corn, wheat, soy beans and hay  , but their main product is fun!

The Pizza Farm at Crumland is an interactive way to help children understand that all food-- including pizza --originates on a farm. Here we've planted a one-acre circle and divided it into 8 parts. Inside each is a pizza ingredient. It's a great way for kids to see, touch and learn how their favorite food begins on the farm.
