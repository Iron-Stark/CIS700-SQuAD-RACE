2,D,"['Children are made to work long hours on farms.', 'The United Nations website is useful for the school project.', 'Children have the right to be properly fed, clothed and sheltered.', 'The United Nations has listed the rights it thinks children should have.']",What's the main idea of this passage?,"If you want to do a school project on children's rights, you can look on the Internet for some information. A United Nations website can show you plenty of useful information for the project.
The United Nations lists the rights of children. Most countries agree all of them, but some countries do not. The following are some of the most important rights of children:
Children have the right to be properly fed, clothed and sheltered by their family. If their family can't do so, the government should take _ .
Children have the right to an education and medical care, which should be provided by the government.
Children must not be cruelly punished by their parents or any others.
Children have the right to expect the government to protect them from all kinds of abuse and neglect .
No child under fifteen should be made to fight in an army.
Children have the right to be protected from being made to work too hard to make money for other people.
In some countries children do not have these rights. Many young children are made to work long hours in factories and on farms. In some countries there are so few schools that only rich children get an education. There are not enough doctors or nurses to help many children when they are sick.
The rights of children are, therefore, the rights people think children should have. They are not always the rights children really have.",middle2532.txt
