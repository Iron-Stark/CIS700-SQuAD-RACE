3,B,"['diners', 'restaurant sales', 'eating habits', 'menus']",The passage mainly discusses the relationship between music and   _  .,"Music probably isn't the main reason for where you choose to eat something, but restaurant owners put a lot of thought into what they play.
In a recent article about music's role in restaurant design, author Mark Brandau details the different ways sound influences   sales. Here are a few ""notes"" to keep in mind the next time you need to pick a restaurant:
It's someone's job to design playlists. Restaurant owners hire   experts to build music playlists for different times of the day. A restaurant owner says, ""Lively songs encourage quick dining and faster table turns at meal time.""
What you hear at lunch won't be what you hear at dinner. And what you hear after dinner will be something totally different. If a restaurant wants to increase late-night sales, music is very important to creating the right atmosphere.
Music builds brands  . Nick Vojnovic, president of Little Greek, had been in the business for 20 years. He began to realize how important music is to the restaurant experience after listening to a manager from The Cheesecake Factory speak about using music to develop brand identity.
Where have you heard that before? Restaurants may be using the same music providers. Ambiance Radio provides playlists for Little Greek in Florida, and also Schlotzsky's and Union Square Cafe in New York City. Vojnovic, who started his business at Chili's, pointed out that years ago, background music was changed only once per quarter.
Music helps restaurants choose diners. Brandau explains that some restaurants would like to turn up the music, not to bother   certain groups of customers, but to stay true to their main diners. If college kids are a restaurant's main diners, the restaurant will surely play music that makes older people feel uninvited.",high16884.txt
