0,A,"['pay attention to the message itself', 'try to know what happened around you', 'look up something about the speaker', 'not write down anything']","To be an effective listener, you'd better  _","Do you notice that though students spend the same amount of time in class, some get better grades than others? In some ways, it's because they are different listeners. When having classes, some of them listen carefully. We call them _ listeners. Some just daydream or talk to others. They are ineffective listeners.
How are some listeners effective? First of all, they don't care about some poor situations, like an uncomfortable seat or a personal problem. They say ""No"" to anything that will stop them from understanding and remembering. After leaving a class or meeting, they remember what the speakers said, not the room conditions or the speaker's accent  .
Effective listeners always pay attention to the message itself. They try not to be influenced   by their own feelings or opinions. They do not decide if the thing is boring, too easy, or too difficult before listening. They like getting the challenge   of new ideas. To help remember difficult ideas, they write down important words and phrases.
However, ineffective listeners often daydream. They don't like to hear what they don't agree with or easily understand. They are often so busy taking notes that they miss the speaker's main idea. These listeners leave a speech or a class with a notebook full of words, but the notebook means nothing.
