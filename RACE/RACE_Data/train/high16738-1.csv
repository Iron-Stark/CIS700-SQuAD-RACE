1,A,"['How to adapt to the college life quickly.', 'To make new friends.', 'To learn to be independent in thinking.', 'Not to make herself under much pressure in grades.']",Which of the following suggestions is not given to the receiver in the letter?,"Dear XXX, 
As we drove off from Columbia, I wanted to write a letter to you to tell you all that is on my mind.
First, I want to tell you how proud we are. You have become a talented and accomplished young woman. You should be as proud of yourself as we are.
College will be the most important years in your life. It is in college that you will truly discover what learning is about. You often question ""what good is this course"". I encourage you to be inquisitive  , but I also want to tell you: ""Education is what you have left after all that is taught is forgotten."" What I mean by that is -- the material taught isn't as important as you gaining the ability to learn a new subject, and the ability to analyze a new problem. 
Do your best in classes, but don't let pressure get to you. If you graduate and learn something in your four years, we would feel happy. Your Columbia degree will take you far, even if you don't graduate with honors. So please don't give yourself pressure. The only thing that matters is that you learned. The only measurement you should use is that you tried. 
Most importantly, make friends and be happy. College friends are often the best in life, because during college you are closer to them physically than to your family. Also, going through independence and adulthood is a natural bonding   experience. Pick a few friends and become really close to them -- pick the ones who are genuine and sincere to you. Don't worry about their hobbies, grades, looks, or even personalities. If you think you like someone, tell her. You have very little to lose. People are not perfect, so as long as they are genuine and sincere, trust them and be good to them. They will give back. This is my secret of success -- that I am genuine with people and trust them (unless they do something to lose my trust). 
College is the four years where you have:
  *the greatest amount of free time
  *the first chance to be independentk%s5$u
  *the most flexibility to change
  *the lowest risk for making mistakes
So please treasure your college years - make the best of your free time, become an independent thinker in control of your destiny. May Columbia become the happiest four years in your life, and may you blossom into just what you dream to be.

                                                                  XXX",high16738.txt
