One day he goes to the city to visit his friend, Jack. Jack asks Tom to have lunch together. They go into the restaurant and sit down at a table. Tom looks around and he sees some old people put eye glasses on before reading their books, so after lunch he goes to a shop to buy some glasses, too. He walks along the road, and soon finds a shop. The man in the shop makes him try on a lot of glasses, but Tom always says, ""No, I can't read with these.""
The man in the shop becomes more and more puzzled  . At last he says, ""Excuse me, but can't you read at all?""
""No, I can't."" Tom says, ""If I can read, do you think I come here to buy glasses?""",middle254.txt
