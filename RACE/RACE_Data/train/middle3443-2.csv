2,B,"['The government provides a bike for each family.', 'Local people can get these bikes at special docking stations.', 'If you want a key, you need to pay PS5.', 'Few people have agreed to the idea.']",Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?,"In London, there has always been a main problem. In order to solve this problem, the government has decided to have a bike revolution . It has decided to provide 6,000 bikes for the people to rent. The government encourages local people to ride bikes in order to solve the traffic problem.
More than 12,000 people have agreed to the idea. Some of them ask for more than one key. Although there are not enough bikes, an official  from the government said that they would find some ways to deal with such a shortage.
Local people can get these bikes at special docking stations .There are about 315 docking stations across the city. About 12,450 keys have already been handed out to the local people, but only 6,000 keys can be used now.
Let's see the cost you need to pay. One key costs PS3, and the cost of using the bike is PS1 for an hour. The cost per hour increases as the hours increase, so it will cost PS50 if you rent the bike for 24 hours.
The official from the government said they also needed to face a lot of problems, for example, some bikes may be lost. But they said they would try their best to solve all the problems to make sure the success of the program.",middle3443.txt
