4,A,"['Meeting Disasters During Honeymoon', 'Six Natural Disasters', 'Newly-wed Couple Met Australian Floods', 'Japanese Tsunami']",The best title for this passage is  _  .,"A newly-wedded couple on a four-month honeymoon were hit by six natural disasters, including the Australian floods, Christchurch earthquake and Japanese tsunami  .
Stefan and Erika Svanstrom left Stockholm, Sweden, on December 6 and were immediately stuck in Munich, Germany, due to one of Europe's worst snowstorms.
Travelling with their baby daughter, they flew on to Cairns in Australia which was then struck by one of the most violent cyclones in the nation's history.
From there, the couple, in their 20s, were forced to shelter for 24 hours on the cement   floor of a shopping centre with 2,500 others.
""Trees were being knocked over and big branches were put down across the streets, "" Mr. Svanstrom told Sweden's Expressen newspaper. ""We escaped by the skin of our teeth.""
Mr. Svanstrom said they then headed south to Brisbane but the city was experiencing massive flooding, so they crossed the country to Perth where they narrowly escaped burning bush fires.
The couple then flew to Christchurch, New Zealand, arriving just after a massive magnitude   6.3 earthquake attacked the city on February 22.
Mrs. Svanstrom said, ""When we got there the whole town was like a war zone. We could not visit the city since it was completely blocked off, so instead we travelled around before going to Japan.""
But days after the Svanstroms arrived, Tokyo was rocked by Japan's largest earthquake since records began.
""The trembling was horrible and we saw roof tiles fly off the buildings,"" Mr. Svanstrom said. ""It was like the buildings were swaying back and forth.""
The family returned to Stockholm on March 29 after a much calmer visit to their last destination China.
But Mr. Svanstrom --- who also survived the destructive Boxing Day tsunami that hit southeast Asia in 2004 --- said the marriage was still going strong.
He added, ""I know marriages have to experience some difficulties, but I think we have been through most of them. We've certainly experienced more than our fair share of disasters, but the most important thing is that we're together and happy.""",high7128.txt
