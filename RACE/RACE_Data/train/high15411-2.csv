2,C,"['Female- only toilet can only be found on international flights.', 'Women will feel uncomfortable when they know a male is waiting at the toilet door.', 'The rest of the toilets on international flights will be for men only.', 'You will be curious about ""washlets"" when you first see it.']","According to the passage, which of the following statement is not true?","Japan's All Nippon Airways, which has asked passengers to visit the toilet before boarding to help the environment, said Tuesday it will fit its jets with a women-only lavatory .
ANA will introduce one female-only toilet per aircraft on international flights next month after a survey of women fliers identified  it was the second most attractive service they wished for after being offered desserts. The rest of the toilets onboard will be for men and women as usual.
""We received many comments that having a women-only lavatory would be a factor in differentiating our airline from others,"" said an NAN spokesman.
""Many women said that they feel uncomfortable taking their time in the lavatory knowing that a male is waiting just behind them in line,"" he said. The spokesman denied that the new service was introduced following complaints about men soiling  the bathrooms, telling reporters: ""Those opinions may exist, but we do not have that data on hand"".
Since 2006 ANA has pursued   a one - month awareness campaign each year in which it asks fliers on 38
flights and four international flights to visit the bathroom before boarding to reduce their body weight and therefore cut he plane's carbon-dioxide emissions.
The airline is also planning to install ""washlets"" in it's aircraft-electric toilet seats with water sprays for washing-a common sight in Japan and generally a source of amusement for first-time visitors and users.
The ""washlets"" will be installed in the Boeing777-300ER,due to begin operating in April, and the Boeing 787 fleet set to start flying this year.",high15411.txt
