3,A,"['Only one.', 'Two.', 'Three.', 'None.']",How many meals did the traveller have on the ship?,"An English traveller found himself in Norway with only enough money to buy the ticket for his journey back home.As he knew that it would take him only two days to get to England,he decided that he could easily spend the time without food. So he bought a ticket and got on the ship. The man closed his ears to the sound of the lunch bell.When dinner time came,he didn't go to dining room,saying that he was not feeling very well.
The next morning he still didn't have breakfast and at lunchtime he again stayed in his room. But at dinnertime he was so hungry that he went to the dining room and ate everything the waiter put in front of him. He got ready for the quarrel.
""Bring me the bill,""he said.""The bill,Sir?"" said the waiter in surprise.""There isn't any bill.On our ship meals are included in the money for the ticket,""said the waiter.",middle4991.txt
