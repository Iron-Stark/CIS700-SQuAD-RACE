1,D,"['sixty percent of the children in the world are girls', 'more than 100 million girls will never go to school', 'most of the girls are tired of going to school', 'more than one half of the children who never go to school are girls']",Special efforts should be made for girls because   _  .,"Each year,millions of children around the world are unable to go to school.To draw attention to this widespread problem,the United Nations (UN) is putting education first.Recently,the UN screened a documentary film called Back to School.The film is the second in a series of documentaries   for the project Time for School.
These films follow seven children from seven different countries.This 12year project began in 2003,when the children first started school.""This is something we could do to help the education crisis in the world,""said producer and writer Judy Katz.""Documentary filmmakers can get deeply involved in a problem and do something about it.""
More than 100 million children will never set foot in a school.Sixty percent of those children are girls.Cheryl Faye,head of the UN Girls Education Initiative,spoke about the many factors that prevent girls from getting an education.One problem is the long distance many children must travel to get to school.Also,girls in many cultures are traditionally expected to marry early and work to help their families.""We need to make a special effort for girls,""Faye said.
As part of the UN's Millennium goals,the organization wants every single child to get at least an elementary education by 2015.
Students from Lawrence Middle School in New York were deeply moved after they saw the film.The seventhgrade class is raising money to help build a library on the outskirts of Nairobi,Kenya,where Joab--a child in the documentary--lives.The class teacher,Karen Weiner,and the class are known in their school as the ""Kenya crew"".All the kids were really happy to support Joab and said they felt great about their fundraising efforts.Like the seventhgraders at Lawrence Middle School,kids can work together to make a difference in places like Nairobi.By raising money for education,kids can help children on the other side of the world have a chance of a better,happier life.",high18619.txt
