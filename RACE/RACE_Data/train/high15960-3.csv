3,B,"['The author had known Rich Ezzo before.', ""The author hasn't dreamed of getting rich immediately."", 'The author always prefers e-books to paper books.', 'The author likes Get Rich Quick-type of publications.']",Which of the following is supported by the passage?,"A week ago, I had the great pleasure of reading an e-book,
By Rich Ezzo.It took only about an hour to read.
When I first received a copy, I thought it was a Get Rich Quick type of publication.Nothing is wrong with Get Rich Quick, but my mind just doesn't chase after dreams of wealth.I think that if God ever wants me to be rich, he knows where to find my purse.
When I began reading
I was overjoyed to find that Rich Ezzo isn't money hungry either.He, too, is hungry far more important than money.
Since I love this e-book so much, why wait a week to write the review? Simple.I wanted to see if the effect it had on me was a keeper.After reading the last word of the e-book, I totally agreed with the subtitle which promised to forever change the way we thought about money.I had so many thoughts running around my mind that I had to install  a stoplight to stop some while others made their way into the picture, then I yielded  them as a few ones arrived in town.
.
It has been a week and the effect is the same.I truly do look at money differently and have even done a few things differently this week.This is an e-book you'll want to read, I promise.I often recommend books to my daughter, and this is one that I didn't just ""suggest""---I left it open at the bottom of the computer and told each one, ""Read it, you'll love it.""
I would never point someone in a direction I wouldn't go myself.I urge you to visit the author's website,
, and to download the e-book.You won't regret it.",high15960.txt
