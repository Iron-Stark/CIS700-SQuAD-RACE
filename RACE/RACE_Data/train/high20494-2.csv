2,D,"['her leg hurt badly', 'her classmates laughed at her', ""she didn't practise dancing well"", 'she thought she would look stupid']",Nuala didn't want to dance on the stage because   _  .,"The doctor examined Nuala's leg. Nuala tried not to cry, but it was a challenge. Her leg really hurt.
""How did you hurt yourself?"" asked the doctor.
""I jumped off a swing ,"" said Nuala. ""Is it broken?""
""It sure is,"" said the doctor, holding out the X ray. ""See right here?""
Two hours later, Nuala left the hospital on crutches . Her leg was in a cast .
""What will I tell Ms. Chang?"" she asked her mother in the car.
Ms. Chang was Nuala's dance teacher. The spring dance performance was only two weeks away. Nuala's cast would be on for at least six weeks!
""She's going to be so mad at me!"" cried Nuala.
But Ms. Chang wasn't mad. She said, ""We'll think of something.""
Nuala was unwilling to go on stage with her crutches. ""I look stupid,"" she complained. ""I can't dance with these.""
""Have you ever heard the expression 'The show must go on'?""said Ms. Chang. Together, they went through the show. They thought of how Nuala could move to the music. They thought of ways for her to dance on crutches.
The night of the performance, Ms. Chang almost had to push Nuala on the stage. Nuala's cast looked big and clumsy , but she went out and danced. In the end, the audience went wild clapping. Lots of roses were thrown to Nuala's feet! The show did go on!",high20494.txt
