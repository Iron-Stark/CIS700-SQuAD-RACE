2,B,"['The Japanese have a diet rich in seaweed.', 'All the Japanese studied have the special enzyme.', ""All the North Americans studied don't have the enzyme."", 'The enzyme helps people to get more energy.']",Which of the following is FALSE?,"Do you like to eat sushi ? Many people are afraid to eat it, because they think the bacteria  in it might make them sick. However, a new study shows that sea bacteria are good for people. The study finds that a special enzyme  from sea bacteria is helpful to humans. It helps people to get more energy from food.
To people's surprise, the enzyme is present only in the Japanese. The Japanese traditionally like to eat food rich in seaweed . And the seaweed is rich in this kind of enzyme.
However, the enzyme isn't present in all the Japanese. During the study, just 5 out of 14 Japanese had the enzyme. All the Americans studied didn't have the enzyme.
""The number is small,"" said researcher Mirjam Czjzek. ""But we can say that this enzyme is present only in the Japanese and not in the North Americans.""
Then some people think that maybe other people are able to get the enzyme if they eat a lot of seaweed. The study suggests that they collect uncooked seaweed to make their sushi.
Restaurant sushi is often cooked, which will destroy the enzyme. So, if you want to get that enzyme, you can travel to Japan to have a taste of the real sushi.",middle5377.txt
