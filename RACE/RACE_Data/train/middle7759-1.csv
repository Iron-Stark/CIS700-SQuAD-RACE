1,A,"['thought she would get five dollars', 'stopped to read the note', 'knew she would get fifty dollars', 'felt very amazed']","On her way to the bank, the widow   _  .","A businessman, who was very fond of music, was asked by a poor widow to give her some help. Her husband, who was a musician, had died, and left her very poor indeed.
The businessman saw that the widow and her daughter, who was with her, were in great distress. He looked with pity into their pale faces, and was sure that their sad story was true.
""How much do you want, my good woman?"" said the businessman.
""Five dollars will save us,"" said the poor widow, with some hesitation, after she thought for a few seconds.
The businessman sat down at his desk, took a piece of paper, wrote a few lines on it, and gave it to the widow with the words, ""Take it to the bank you see on the other side of the street.""
The widow thanked the man, and then quickly walked to the bank with her daughter, without stopping to read the note. The banker at once counted out fifty dollars instead of five, and passed them to the window.
She was amazed when she saw so much money. ""Sir, there is a mistake here."" she said. ""You have given me fifty dollars, and I asked for only five.""
The banker then looked at the note once more, and said, ""The check calls for fifty dollars.""
The banker then asked her to wait a few minutes, while he went to see the businessman who gave her the note.
""Yes,"" said the businessman, when he had heard the banker's story, ""I did make a mistake. I wrote fifty instead of five hundred. Give the poor widow five hundred dollars, for such honesty is poorly rewarded   with even that sum.""",middle7759.txt
