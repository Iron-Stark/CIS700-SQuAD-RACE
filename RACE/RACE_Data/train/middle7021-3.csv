3,D,"['To know more about Mr. Heppell.', 'To make friends with Mr. Heppell.', 'To ask Mr. Heppell to teach in the school.', 'To ask Mr. Heppell to help protect forests.']",What is the purpose of this letter?,"Dear Mr. Heppell,
I am Sabrina Akhtar studying in a high school and I've noticed that forests are disappearing.
Forests are disappearing around the world each year. This is because of many different things such as farming and tourism pollution. If we stop doing these things, there will be a good future for people of tomorrow. Now I'm writing to ask you to help stop forests from disappearing. You can help by making shops stop selling paper made from trees and change to tree-free paper(paper not made from trees). This will help protect forests. There are many things we can do to help protect forests. If you would like to know more, please visit http://www.rainforestweb.org.  By changing the little things, we can make a big difference. If you would like to contact  me, please e-mail me at shazadinol@hotmail.co.uk. Thank you for taking your time in reading this letter.
Yours sincerely,
Sabrina Akhtar",middle7021.txt
