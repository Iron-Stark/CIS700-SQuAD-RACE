0,D,"['give up', 'be nervous', 'ask her friends for help', 'ask her mother for help']",The writer used to  _  when she had something difficult to do.,"What will you do when you have something difficult to do? I used to ask my mother for help. But she always said, ""Do it yourself, dear."" or ""God helps those who help themselves , girl."" I was not glad at all. I thought she was the laziest mother in the world.
For example, one day, I decided to invite some friends to my home. My bedroom was not in order. Books were everywhere. And I didn't make the bed. I asked my mother to help me to clean it, but she still said, ""Do it yourself, girl.""
Because of my""lazy mother"", I have to wash my clothes and clean my room. I have to help my parents do some housework. I even have to go to the dentist by myself. It is really hard for me to do everything well, but I have learned a lot.
As time goes by, I come to understand my mother. She makes me clever and active! What a great mother!",middle6508.txt
