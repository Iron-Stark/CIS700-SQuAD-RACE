1,C,"['were often punished by staff', ""weren't allowed to go outside"", 'were once treated badly', 'all suffered from mental illness']",From the passage we learn most children in the shelter   _  .,"Growing up, I wanted to be just like my mom. She was kind. People always seemed to feel comfortable in her presence. For years, she was a volunteer in our community. I loved going to the local nursing home with her where she taught a ceramic class.
On one summer day, Mama told me to get changed and meet her at the car.
I had planned to spend the day at the lake with friends. Why did she have to ruin everything? I imagined the cool lake water. Irritated, I climbed into the car and slammed the door shut. We sat in silence. I was too upset to make conversation.
""Tasha, would you like to know where we are going?"" Mama asked calmly.
""No,"" I said.
""We are going to volunteer at a children's shelter today. I have been there before and I think it would benefit you,"" she explained.
When we reached the shelter, Mama rang the doorbell. Moments later, we were greeted by a woman. She led us to the front room where all of the children were playing. I noticed a baby whose body was scarred with iron marks. I was told it was because she wouldn't stop crying. The majority of the children had noticeable physical scars. Others hid their emotional wounds.
As I took in my surroundings, I felt a gentle tug on my shirt. I looked down to see a little girl looking up at me. ""Hi. You want to play dolls with me?"" she asked. I looked over at Mama for _ . She smiled and nodded. I turned back and said, ""Sure."" Her tiny hand reached up and held mine, as if to comfort me.
My mom taught me a valuable lesson that summer. I returned to the shelter with her several times. During those visits, some of the children shared their troubled pasts with me and I learned to be grateful for what I had. Today as I strive to instill   these values in my own child, I reflect back to that experience. It was a time that I will never forget.",high5097.txt
