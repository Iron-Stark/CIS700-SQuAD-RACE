2,A,"['There was little possibility to cure his disease.', 'He had been happy before he was ill.', 'His disease resulted from his hard work.', 'His disease made him sleepy all the time.']",Which of the following is TRUE about his illness?,"Many years ago, Norman Cousins was seriously ill. He was given six months to live. His chance for recovery was 1 in 500. 
He could see the worry, depression and anger in his life contributed to his disease. He wondered, ""If illness can be caused by negativity  , can health be created by positivity  ?"" He decided to make an experiment of himself. 
Laughing was one of the most positive activities he knew. He watched all the funny movies he could find. He read funny stories. He asked his friends to call him whenever they said, heard or did something interesting. 
His pain was so great that he could not sleep. Laughing for 10 solid minutes, he found, relieved the pain for several hours so he could sleep. He fully recovered from his illness and lived another 20 happy and healthy years. 
Laughing is necessary to our health. If we're not well, laughing helps us get well; if we are well, laughing helps us stay that way. So, if you like laughing, do it as often as you can. 
Use whatever makes you laugh--movies, books, jokes or friends. The people around you may think you're strange, but sooner or later they'll join in even if they don't know what you're laughing about.",high24122.txt
