1,C,"['Some relish.', 'Some vegetables.', 'A stone.', 'Some salt.']",What did the traveler put into the pot at first?,"A poor traveler arrived at a small village. He had no food or money. He only had a cooking pot. He
made a small cooking fire, placed his pot on it, and poured in some water. When a few villagers asked
what he was doing, he said that he was making stone soup which was a recipe passed down from his
father. He then dropped   a round stone into the pot.
Then the traveler told the villagers stories of his travels and the exciting things he'd seen. He tasted
  his soup and said it was nice, but a bit of salt would be better. One villager went home and came
back with some salt for the soup.
A few more villagers stopped to see what was going on when they heard the traveler speaking. The
traveler told more stories and said that some carrots or onions would be nice to the delicious soup. So
another villager said he could give a few carrots and brought them from his home.
This continued with the traveler asking for onions, a bit of meat, celery  , potatoes to the soup.
Finally, the soup was OK and everyone enjoyed the tasty meal.",middle2110.txt
