      Get the most out of your dictionary by understanding how to use it correctly. You can use a good English dictionary to find words, for meaning, for pronunciation, to check your spelling and to understand explanations. If you are using a computer, use an English spell checker (but don't rely on it).
     Copy short passages of English text from newspapers, magazines or books.
      Try dictation exercises. You can do this online or get friends to read out text for you to write. Then check your writing-pay more attention to spelling.
     There are many forums    on the Internet. Find one about your interests or hobbies. Observe the niceties  of forum use,  and make an apology if you think you have made any mistakes.

Check what you've written. Even better, get someone else to read what you've written ahead of time.
