1,D,"['she entered Cornell University', 'she took a course on speed reading', 'her mother managed to help her out', 'she developed her own way of reading']",The writer's reading ability improved a great deal mainly because   _  .,"When I was in 7th grade, I had a lot of trouble reading. My mother used to sit by my side, and explain each paragraph of each school reading assignment to me because I didn't understand what I was reading. She would have to read each paragraph to me, and then after each  paragraph, she summarized what we just read.
In class, I tried to hide the fact that I couldn't read. My teachers gave us the last 10 minutes of class to start our reading homework, and I would sit there for the last ten minutes of class staring at the page, pretending I was reading it -I remember a terrible feeling of not wanting to get in trouble for not being able to comprehend .I had to wait until I got home so my mother could explain it to me. How did I never get into Cornell University? By eighth grade I started understanding a little on my own, but I was reading at an  _ slow speed.

I found that I stopped daydreaming and thinking about other things while I was reading, and started getting the larger meaning. I was reading faster and comprehending better.

When you read faster, your concentration actually increases and your comprehension goes up because instead of getting lost in the words, you see the overall picture.",high23546.txt
