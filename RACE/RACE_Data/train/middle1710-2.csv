2,A,"['If we know how to learn, we can get a lot of knowledge.', 'We can learn everything from our teachers.', 'The writer tells us that practice is more important for students than learning.', 'It is the only job for students to learn knowledge.']",Which of the following is right?,"School education is very important and useful. The students both learn knowledge and get educated. Yet, no one can learn everything from school. Scientists, such as Edison, Newton, Galileo and Einstein, didn't learn everything from school. They learnt a lot of knowledge outside school or practiced a lot themselves. A teacher, though he knows a lot, can't teach his students everything.
The teacher's job is to teach his students how to learn, how to read and how to think. A good teacher with rich experience in teaching can teach his students the methods (=""ways)"" of study. Through these methods students are able to learn and get a lot of things by themselves.
Usually it's very easy for students to memorize some knowledge, but it is difficult to use it to solve problems. If a teacher really teaches students the ability  of how to use knowledge, it means the teacher has learned lots of knowledge by himself(or herself). The success in learning shows he or she knows how how how to study.
