0,D,"['unfair', 'normal', 'easy', 'strange']","According to British newspapers, questions for Oxbridge applicants are very   _  .","Every year, British newspapers report on the stranger questions asked in Oxbridge (Oxford & Cambridge) interviews. Often, though, these questions are not as strange as they first seem. And they are all designed to give applicants   a chance to think.
Arriving for her first Oxford interview, my sister Jen saw that there was only one chair in the waiting room. On the chair was a large fork. Jen had heard about the strange things in Oxbridge interviews, and believed that this was a test. ""What if they're watching me?"" she thought. ""If I move the fork, it will show initiative  ; if I don't move it, it will show that I can easily fit into new situations."" In the end, she sat uncomfortably on the edge of the chair!
Applicants must be prepared for the unexpected. Now it was Jen's turn. She was handed a monkey skull   and asked to talk about it. At first, this seemed unfair --- what could she say? But she soon calmed down, started thinking, and found that there was plenty to talk about.
Oxbridge interviews are designed to find out how you think, not just what you think. And there are no wrong answers. Jen learnt that, and she passed the interview. What advice does she give? "" Don't be nervous, and be prepared for the unexpected!""",high2198.txt
