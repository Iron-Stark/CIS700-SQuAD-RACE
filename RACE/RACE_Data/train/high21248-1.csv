1,C,"['Hawking is famous in the fields of cosmology and quantum gravity.', 'Hawking was diagnosed to have the motor neuron disease. k*s5u', 'Hawking started to suffer symptoms of disorder when he was in Oxford.', 'Hawking gradually lost the use of his arms, legs and voice.']",Which of the following statements is NOT true?,"Stephen Hawking was born on January 8, 1942. He is known for his contributions to the fields of cosmology   and quantum gravity , especially in the context of black holes. He experienced extreme difficulties and obstacles in his life, which only made him stronger. Finally he contributed much to the careers he devoted to and became one of the most famous scientists in the world.
Hawking was outstanding in his school life. After a successful period of education at St. Albans School, the entrance of Oxford opened to him. In March 1959, at the age of 17, Hawking took the scholarship examination with the aim of studying natural sciences at Oxford. Then Hawking went to Cambridge to do research in cosmology.
When Stephen Hawking was dreaming about his future, he faced extreme difficulties and obstacles. Symptoms of disorder first appeared while he was enrolled at Cambridge; he lost his balance and fell down a flight of stairs, hitting his head. The diagnosis   of motor neuron  disease came when Hawking was 21, shortly before his first marriage, and doctors said he would not survive more than two or three years. Hawking gradually lost the use of his arms, legs, and voice, and is now almost completely paralyzed .
Despite his disease, he describes himself as ""lucky"" --- not only has time to make influential discoveries, but also has, in his own words, ""a very attractive family"".
As someone has said, when we meet frustration, someone fights, someone cries, someone escapes, someone tries. Hawking succeeds because he tries.",high21248.txt
