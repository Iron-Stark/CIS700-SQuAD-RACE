2,A,"['She failed to keep her promise.', 'She kept her promise.', 'She managed to give up smoking.', 'She broke something her mother gave her.']",What did Martha really do after mother warned her?,"Our 16-year-old daughter started to smoke last Christmas. It killed me to see that lovely girl with a cigarette  in her mouth. I told her how I felt. Martha continued to smoke, saying, ""It's my life,"" and so on. I told her if she didn't stop smoking, I wouldn't send her to college. She agreed to give it up.
Last night there was cigarette smell on Martha's breath. She had to say she had broken her word. Now I must do what I've said to punish  her.
Martha is unusually bright and wants to teach children. I'm working full-time to put her older sister through school and would do the same for Martha. My husband's pay is good, but with prices going up all the time we could never educate the girls unless I kept on working.
My theory  is that if smoking is more important to Martha than college, I'm a fool to work to put her through college.",high16292.txt
