2,B,"['teachers', 'parents', 'students', 'kids']",This passage is mainly written for   _  .,"One of the hardest things to do when you are a small child is to start school, and have a new teacher every year. I remember when I was in fourth grade, there were tons of rumors   about my teacher. They said that he would hit kids with erasers. _ , and to this day I still remember him as one of those people who really helped me in life.
One of the things that you can do to help your kids get ready for a new teacher is to go to meet him or her before the year starts. This allows students to know who the teacher is, and break the ice.
It is common for students to be fearful of the teacher for the first few days. Maybe they look scary  . However, as a parent, you need to teach your kids that teachers are people too, and that they want nothing but the best for you in life.
If your child is still having trouble adjusting to   a teacher, you could ask your child to be taught by a different teacher.
Adjusting to teachers can be an uncertain thing for a young child. Whether your child knows nothing about this person, or maybe he has heard a rumor about him, it can be a scary thing. As a parent, all you can do is to make sure that your children know the teacher is there to help, not be scary.",high14112.txt
