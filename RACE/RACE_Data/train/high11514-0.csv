The US president has taken part in the survival television show Running Wild With Bear Grylls, which will air on NBC later this year. In the show, Obama goes on an adventure with host Bear Grylls, learning how to survive in the Alaskan wilderness.
Edward Michael ""Bear"" Grylls, 41, has become known around the world as one of the most famous outdoor adventurers. The Briton has appeared on a number of wilderness survival shows in which he has climbed, sailed, and eaten bugs or cow tongue.
Obama doesn't have to eat bugs or cow tongue on his adventure with Grylls. But he does have to eat leftovers - a bloody salmon  . It was partly enjoyed by a bear that left some meat behind.
Although he is far from the White House kitchen, Obama seems to enjoy the outdoors. ""As president, I am in what's called the bubble , and the Secret Service makes sure that I'm always out of danger ...  but  I sometimes want to get out,"" he said in a video.
However, Obama's appearance on the show isn't just for fun. He took part to raise awareness of the effect global warming has had on the US's largest state, Alaska.",high11514.txt
