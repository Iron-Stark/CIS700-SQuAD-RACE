In 2000, Beijing still had 1,300 hutong, according to amateur historian Zhang Wei. But he estimates that since then, at least half of them have disappeared.
According to regulations, people can report illegal buildings to urban patrol officers, known as chengguan, and buildings found to be illegal will be demolished by force.

Many owners added a second floor or even more floors to their houses, especially in buildings near main streets, in order to rent more apartments and make more money.
