2,C,"['We should wash the cut with cold running water.', 'We should put a piece of dry clean cloth over the cut.', 'We should clean it and put a piece of clean paper round the cut.', 'We should wash and cool the area of the skin under the cold tap for a while.']","If Jim cuts his finger, what first aid should you give according to the passage?","What would you do if you had an accident in your daily life?
It is important for you to get some knowledge about first aid in your daily life. If a person has an accident, he / she needs medical care before a doctor can be found. When you give first aid, you must know three things:
First, when a person stops breathing  , open his / her mouth to see if there is food in his / her mouth. Second, if a person cannot breathe, try to start his / her breathing at once, using a mouth-to-mouth way. Third, if a person is hurt badly, try to stop the bleeding   at once. And then take him / her to a doctor, because if a person loses one third of his / her blood, he / she may be in great danger.
Many accidents may happen at home, and everyone should know some first aid to deal with common injuries. When a person _ by an animal, wash the wound with cold running water before he / she is taken to see a doctor. When a person is burnt, wash and cool the area of the skin under the cold tap for a while, then put a piece of dry clean cloth over the burn. If a person is badly burnt, take him / her to the doctor. If a person cuts his / her finger, clean it and put a piece of clean paper round the cut.
In the future we should learn more about first aid and try to spread   it.",middle2191.txt
