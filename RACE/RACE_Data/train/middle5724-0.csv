The building next door was only a few feet away from mine. There was a woman who lived there, whom I had never met, yet I could see her seated by her window each afternoon, sewing or reading.
After several months went by, I began to notice that her window was dirty. Everything was unclear through the dirty window. I often said to myself, ""I wonder why that woman doesn't wash her window. It really looks terrible.""
