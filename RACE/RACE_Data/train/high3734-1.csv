1,A,"['Negative.', 'Careless.', 'Positive.', 'Critical.']",What's the author's attitude toward bargaining?,"In the UK, we like a good bargain.

But surprisingly, the British hate _ In markets you might see the odd British person battling with a stall owner to bring down the price of a pair of trousers or some furniture.

The act of bargaining with someone is very theatrical, in my opinion. It's a test to see who can stand their ground for the longest. But it is not in British people's nature to ""perform"" in public, especially around strangers.
However, in the US, people are generally more willing to haggle. And if you wander into a market, you're likely to hear a number of phrases that Americans reserve for such occasions.
First, "" _ "" is commonly said by the customer to indicate they think the stall holder is working very hard, probably a little too hard, to get the price he wants.
Or you might hear the buyer telling a stall holder that ""the kid's gotta have braces"", which means they don't have enough spare money lying around to afford the price being offered.
