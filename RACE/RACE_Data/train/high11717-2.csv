This may explain why the readership of newspapers online in the UK is very different from people who read printed newspapers.
The most popular newspaper in the UK is The Sun and is also the most popular newspaper in the world.The ""mid--market"" audience mainly reads The Daily Mail.Of the ""quality"" newspapers, the most popular is the Daily Telegraph.
