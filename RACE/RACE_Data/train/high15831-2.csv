For the most part, poor digestion is not a habit given by our parents. We give it to ourselves through the way we eat.
Oh, poor digestion can lead to weight problems. Here's how: When a person feels stressed, the part of the central nervous system that connects digestion switches off. This is called the parasympathetic nervous system . At those times of stress, the body can take in food and  process some of it, but digestion doesn't work correctly to digest all the nutritional goodness from the food. Poor digestion is not always obvious by observing symptoms; you can get some illnesses but not always. Poor digestion can be seemingly silent.

When digestion is not proper, the body starts ""starving"" from lack of necessary nutrients . Yes, it goes into a starvation problem and starts absorbing  fat and energy. It thinks it's in a famine . The good news is that it's easy to make some corrections and get rid of stress at mealtimes.
If you feel stressed often, it can be helpful to take other food that contains multiple B vitamins. These help, but you could still find yourself stressed at mealtimes.",high15831.txt
