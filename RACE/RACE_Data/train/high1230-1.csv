1,B,"[""their planes couldn't fly high in the sky"", 'they gained much from experience in failure', 'their planes were often checked by the experts', 'they were unpopular among passengers']",Fewer accidents happen to older airlines in that   _  .,"While success is surely sweeter than failure, it seems failure is a far better teacher, and organizations that fail spectacularly often flourish more in the long run, according to a new study by Vinit Desai, assistant professor of management at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. Researchers have found that people missing their goals perform much better in the long run. That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds.
""We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,"" said professor Desai, who led the study. ""But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity.""
Prof Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger. During the 2002 Atlantis flight, a piece of insulation   broke off and damaged the left solid rocket booster   but didn't influence the program. There was little investigation. The Challenger was launched next and another piece of insulation broke off. This time the shuttle and its seven-person crew were destroyed. The disaster led to a major investigation resulting in 29 changes to prevent future disasters.
The difference in response in the two cases came down to this: Atlantis was considered a success and the Challenger a failure.
""Despite crowded skies, airlines are extremely reliable,"" he said. ""The number of failures is extremely small. And past researches have shown that older airlines, those with more experience in failure, have a lower number of accidents.""
Prof Desai doesn't recommend finding out failure in order to learn. Instead, he advises organizations to analyze small failures to collect useful information rather than wait for major failures.",high1230.txt
