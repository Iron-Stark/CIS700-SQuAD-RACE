3,C,"['what the writer experienced when she was 15', ""what the writer did to show thanks for mum's gift"", ""how the writer changed herself with mum's love"", 'how the writer became confident with her great efforts']",The passage is mainly about   _  .,"I was 15 months old, a happy and _ kid, until the day I fell. It was a bad fall. I landed on a piece of glass that cut my eye badly. from then on, my injured, sightless, cloudy gray eye lived on with me. Sometimes people asked me embarrassing questions. Whenever kids played games, I was the ""monster"". I was always imagining that everyone looked down on me.
Yet mum would say to me, ""Hold your head up high and face the world."" I began to depend on that saying.
As a child, I thought mun meant, ""Be careful, or you will fall down or bump into something because you are not looking."" As a teenager, I usually looked down to hide my shame. But I found that when I held my head up high, People liked me.
In high school I even became the class president, but on the inside I still felt like a monster. All I really wanted was to look like everyone else. When things got really bad, I would cry to my mun and she would look at me with loving eyes and say, ""Hold your head up high and face the world. Let them see the beauty that is inside instead of your appearance .""
My mum's love was the sunshine that made me bright. I had faced hard times, and learned not only to be confident  but also to have deep compassion for others.
""Hold your head up high"" has been heard many times in my home. I say it to my children. The gift my mum gave me will live on.",middle5646.txt
