4,C,"['she comes late', ""she doesn't want to say goodbye to her grandma"", 'her mouth is full of chocolate candies', ""she can't speak""]",Why doesn't Jenny say anything when her grandma leaves? Because   _  .,"Today Grandma comes for a visit. She gives my sister and me a box of chocolate candies. We say ""thank you!""
Then Jenny quickly takes off the box. The pieces all look the same! I can't tell which pieces are hard inside and which are soft! I only like the soft ones. Jenny does not care. She is happy to get any kind of candy!
I slowly look at all the pieces; I don't know which one to choose. Just then Dad calls us Grandma is going home, He wants us to say goodbye to her. I hurry to the front door where they are standing. Jenny comes a few minutes later. I say, ""Grandma, I hope to see you soon. I always feel sad when you leave. ""Jenny stands behind me and doesn't say anything. After Grandma goes home, I find out why Jenny doesn't say anything.
She has most of our candies in her mouth! Only a few pieces are left in the bottom of the box! Then I'm sad!",middle263.txt
