Some students performed in the big parade. In order to get ready for  it, this summer, many Beijing middle school students had a different kind of vacation. Instead of hanging out with friends or traveling, they trained  hard for the 60th birthday of China this year.
Students trained from 7:30 am to around 10:00 am or from 4 pm to 6:30 pm, because it was very hot this summer. They wore white hats, T-shirts and blue trousers. The hats and T-shirts were printed with a red logo, the number ""60"".
The first week of training was PE. Students practiced standing and squatting. Then they moved on to practice the group show. When we watched the parade on TV we saw them making colorful pictures.
What did the students think of their unusual summer? ""Sometimes we find it a bit tiring."" said Lu Wenqi, 13. ""But most of us think it's a great _ to take part in such an important show."" Li Hui, 15, thought the same as Lu. She said her classmates were hardly late for training. ""It's a wonderful chance for us,"" said Li.
