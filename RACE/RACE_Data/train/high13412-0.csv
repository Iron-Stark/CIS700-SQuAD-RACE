0,C,"['Socialized and cute.', 'Clever and brave.', 'Healthy and clever.', 'Professional and strong.']",Which of the following can be used to describe Mini Schnauzers?,"*AmericanMalinois 
We have extra large,strong and healthy puppies born on May 29,2014 and raised on 2.5 acres fenced in Williston Highlands by American Malinois Foundation.
They are not caged or home-raised Malinois.They have taken swimming training and full exercise routine with their parents to make sure they know how to guard themselves and other things this breed can do.I work specifically on the ones which have service dog qualities.
My ideal buyer would be a disabled person in need of a mobile or medical alert service dog.The American Malinois is a working dog and is most content to bond with one person and only follow this person' s orders.Potential owners should be familiar or experienced with this breed.
My fee represents the cost of feeding,grooming,boarding,training,medical and registration with the CKC(Continental Kennel Club).Puppies will have health certificates from vets.
To see videos of the puppies and their parents, go to YouTube and search: American Malinois Foundation.
*MiniSchnauzers 
We have 4 males and 4 females.Our puppies come with a health guarantee.They are trained and all of them have great personalities and would be a great addition to any home.These puppies are for pets only.To keep our bloodlines pure, we do not allow our puppies to be bred. We have been breeding for over 13 years and we only breed Mini Schnauzers. They are the best dogs. They are very smart. We will not ship our puppies. We have had people drive over 1500 miles to purchase our babies.",high13412.txt
