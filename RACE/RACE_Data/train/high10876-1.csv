1,B,"['Try to understand everything.', 'Try to get the main ideas.', 'Pay much attention to details.', 'Translate each word in your mind.']",Which of the following is a good habit when listening?,"Does this situation seem familiar to you? Your English is progressing well, the grammar is now familiar, the reading comprehension is no problem, you are communicating quite fluently, but: Listening is STILL a problem! First of all, remember that you are not alone. Listening comprehension is probably the most difficult job for almost all learners of English as a foreign language. The most important thing is to listen as often as possible. The first step is to find listening resources. The Internet is really a useful tool for English students. You can download The RealPlayer from RealMedia.com. The RealPlayer allows you to use the Internet like a radio station.
Once you have begun to listen on a regular basis, you might still be frustrated   by limited understanding. What should you do?
Here is some of the advice I give my students:
*Accept the fact that you are not going to understand everything.
*Stay relaxed when you do not understand -- even if you continue not to understand for a long time.
*Do not translate what you hear into your native language.
*Listen for the general idea of the conversation. Don't concentrate on detail until you have understood the main ideas.
I remember the problems I had in understanding spoken German when I first went to Germany. In the beginning, when I didn't understand a word, I insisted on translating it in my mind. This method usually resulted in confusion. Then, after the first six months, I discovered two very important facts. Firstly, translating creates a _ l between the listener and the speaker. Secondly, most people repeat themselves constantly. By remaining calm, I noticed that -- even if I didn't pay much attention, I could usually understand what the speaker had said.",high10876.txt
