1,B,"['stop people going out', 'have different ways to make it', 'offer goods to people freely', 'play tricks on consumers']","In order to persuade people to stop shopping, the campaigners   _  .","In the UK, a group of campaigners have declared the last Saturday in November as National Buy Nothing Day. ""Our message is clear: shop less, live more!"" says organizer Michael Smith. ""The challenge is to try simple living for a day. Spend time with family and friends, rather than spending money on them. Anyone can take part, provided they spend a day without spending.""
On Buy Nothing Day, they take to the streets to tackle consumers . They dress as pigs to symbolize greed . They offer to cut up credit cards and hand out shopping bags with the words ""another useless thing I don't need"" written on the side. Some hold street parties to show shoppers that it is possible to have fun without spending money. Others go into shops and put notes saying ""don't buy me"" inside clothes and shoes.
Some protestors  are working against powerful forces. Many retailers  and manufacturers depend on Christmas sales for most of their profits. Around two thirds of GDP in the West is made up of consumer spending. If this drops, many people will lose their jobs. At least that will make it easier for them to buy nothing.
And there is also the risk that the campaigners will be seen as killjoys, who want to stop people enjoying themselves. ""There's a fun side to this,"" says Michael Smith. ""To some it's a protest, but it's also a street party. We're not saying that people are bad because they go shopping, but we need get the message across for people to consume wisely. And after we're finished, we'll probably go for a drink.""",high3552.txt
