2,C,"['He is a man of great wealth.', 'He is a man of great wisdom.', 'He is not very practical.', 'He is not very confident.']",What can we learn about Chandler?,"One dollar a week
The doorway of the house where Chandler has a room. He is dressed in his best clothes, ready for
his evening out. He is going out as his friend, Jeff 'White, comes in.
WHITE    What are you doing this evening, Towers?
CHANDLER   (Smiling) Tonight I'm going to live like a man with a million dollars!
WHITE    What are you talking about? You haven't got a million dollars!
CHANDLER   How much money are you and I paid each week, Jeff?
WHITE    Eighteen dollars. Why?
CHANDLER   And how much of that eighteen dollars do you spend each week?
WHITE    All of it, of course.
CHANDLER   Well, I don't. Each week I save one dollar out of my eighteen. Then,
every ten weeks, I can buy myself an evening to remember.
WHITE    What do you do?
CHANDLER   I put on my finest clothes, go to one of the best restaurants in New York,
eat the most expensive food on the menu, drink the best wine, and then
take a taxi home!
WHITE            ( _ ) Why?
CHANDLER       Why? Because it makes me feel wonderful to sit with some of 'the richest
people in America, and to make them think that I'm rich, too.
WHITE             You're crazy!
CHANDLER        (Laughing) Perhaps I am!
Mrs Black comes in.
MRS BLACK   Ah, Mr Chandler. I wanted to see you.
CHANDLER   Good evening, Mrs Black. What a lovely evening!
MRS BLACK   Lovely evening perhaps, but you haven't paid me for your room this
month. When am I going to get the money?
CHANDLER         Soon, Mrs Black. Very soon.
Mrs Black looks at Chandler s clothes.
MRS BLACK   You can spend money on expensive clothes, but you can't pay for your
room. Is that right?
CHANDLER         (Hurrying away) Good night, Mrs Black!",middle5133.txt
