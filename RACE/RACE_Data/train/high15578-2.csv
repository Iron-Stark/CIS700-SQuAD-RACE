2,B,"['American males should serve in the army', 'different states may have different laws', 'people have to renew their licenses in their home states', ""women should adopt their husbands' family names after marriage""]",We can infer from the text that in the U.S.   _   .,"I got my first driver's license in 1953 by taking driver education in my first year at Central High School in Charlotte,North Carolina.Four years later when it was time to renew my license I was a married woman.Henry and I were living in Baltimore,Maryland.Two weeks before my 20th birthday,Henry drove me to the motor vehicle office on a hot July afternoon.When I got to the office and showed to the man behind the counter my North Carolina driver's license,ready to renew,the man told me that I was under age by Maryland law since I was not yet 21.""Mr. Henry Smith,your husband,will have to sign for you,"" he said.
I argued,pointing to a very large belly  of mine,""I am married.I am having a baby.Why should I have to have someone sign for me to drive?""He answered coldly.""It's the law,madam.""
Henry encouraged me to calm down,just go ahead and get the license and be done with it.""No,""I said.I refused to have him sign for me.So I left without a Maryland license.
I called the North Carolina Motor Vehicle office and renewed my NC license by mail--using my name Susan Brown.And thus it was for the next twelve years.Since Henry was in the army I could drive under my home state license.By the time Henry left the army we were once again living in Maryland,and I had to take the Maryland driver's exam.Since then I just go in and renew every four years--sign the name Susan Brown,have my new picture taken, and walk out with a license to drive.",high15578.txt
