4,C,"[""Animals can't eat animals."", 'All the fish in the deep sea have no eyes.', 'The deeper the sea is, the less sunlight there is.', 'The deep sea is a very safe living place for all kinds of sea animals.']",Which of the following is RIGHT?,"The deep sea is not an easy place to live in. It's cold and dark. The deeper it is, the less sunlight there is. At about 3,000 feet, there is no light at all. It's very dark in the sea. Many fishes have no eyes, but some have big eyes.
