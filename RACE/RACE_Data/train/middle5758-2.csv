2,C,"['Because she wants to find the best price.', 'Because there are so many people.', ""Because she doesn't buy the first thing that she sees."", 'Because she is very free.']",Why does Sandy spend so much time choosing things?,"My name is Tom. I like shopping, but I think shopping with young children is not an easy thing. I have to look after them while I am shopping. I don't think shopping with women is fun, either. I often go shopping with my friends. It is fun. If I think a kind of shirt is fit for me, I think it is also fit for my friends. So I'd like them to think about buying the same things.
My name is Sandy. I like shopping too. But I never go shopping on Saturdays or Sundays. There are a lot of people in the shops. I like shopping with my friends. I usually spend a lot of time choosing   things because I never buy the first thing I see. I always look around other shops to find the best price. I can find the best very well. I dislike buying food in small shops and street markets. I think food in the supermarket is very fresh and very cheap, so I like shopping there.",middle5758.txt
