2,B,"['Scientists have found a similar genetic switch in humans.', 'More British people will suffer type 2 diabetes due to obesity.', '2.2 million people with type 2 diabetes die in Britain every year.', 'Dolphins imitate diabetes to avoid a high blood sugar level.']",Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?,"Scientists have discovered a special biological behavior in dolphins  that could lead to a treatment for late-onset diabetes  in humans. Studies on dolphins found that healthy dolphins switch into a diabetic-like state overnight when they are not feeding, but return to normal when they eat the following morning.
The extraordinary finding has led scientists to suggest that dolphins have ""genetic switch"" that allows them to imitate diabetes while they are not feeding for a night, without suffering any ill effect.
If researchers can identify a similar genetic pathway in human, they may be able to develop drugs to effectively switch off diabetes. Some 2.2 million people in Britain have type 2 (or late-onset) diabetes, a figure that is expected to reach 4 million by 2025 as a consequence of rising levels of obesity .
The tissues of people with type 2 diabetes have become resistant to insulin  so they lose the ability to control sugar levels in their blood. The condition can damage the heart, eyes, kidneys  and nerves and contribute to 5% of all deaths, according to the World Healthy Organization.
Dolphins appear to imitate diabetes to keep high levels of blood sugar when food is rare. Like humans, dolphins need some sugar in their blood for their brains to function normally. Venn-Watson's team analyzed 1,000 blood samples  from 52 dolphins while they didn't eat anything overnight and fed in the morning. At night time, the dolphins' metabolism changed greatly and showed similar characteristics to that seen in people with type 2 diabetes.
""It is our hope that this discovery can lead to new ways to prevent, treat and maybe even cure diabetes in humans,"" said Stephanie Venn-Watson, director of clinical research at the National Marine Foundation in San Diego.",high9658.txt
