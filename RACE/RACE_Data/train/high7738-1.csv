1,A,"['A travel guide.', 'A lawyer.', 'A computer engineer.', 'A teacher.']",What job does the writer probably do?,"In Germany, English expressions are used in conversations and increasingly in written form. Advertisements are often expressed completely in English. When I go to the gym, there are ""aerobic-classes  "". We ""warm up"". We go ""jogging."" In business, we attend a ""meeting"" and we have ""good connections.""
Other nations, like France, have taken action to protect their language from the influence of ""Americanization"". In Germany, however, there is concern that those rules could be connected with Hitler's Third Reich  , when the language had to be pure. If the government curbed the use of English words now, this could be considered by some as a return to that terrible past.
Some German citizens are now trying to stop the use of English vocabulary in German. However, I think generally it is not a big deal to use some common English expressions as they often describe things more directly. But we should know that it is important to use English correctly. All too often, bad English is spoken or even written instead of good German. The proper use of the German language would be the better choice. However, there are some fields that require the use of English words, for example, in the high-tech communication and the Internet fields, there is no alternative to English. Also, I think sometimes I have to speak English when I introduce some scenic places to tourists.
I think you have to find a balance and decide when it is better to use good German in place of bad English or when the use of correct English words is more suitable. Languages have always changed naturally, and I disagree with a restriction by law. Some nice expressions borrowed from other languages can make a conversation more vivid.",high7738.txt
