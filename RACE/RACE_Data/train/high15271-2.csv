2,B,"[""didn't mean to enroll top students from mainland"", ""didn't expect their enrollment of mainland students would be so popular"", 'have strict enrollment rules and only 1 out of 48 students can get the chance to study there', 'are proud of their teaching staff and facilities.']",From the passage we can see HK universities  _  .,"When the six very best students from different cities in Guangdong Province all together chose universities in Hong Kong ; when the very best students of Beijing picked up HK University while giving up the nearby Peking or Tsinghua University ; when the highest enrollment  rate of Hong Kong Science and Industry University reached 48:1, it's the high time to ask where the real education heaven for students in China is.
Years ago, the answer certainly would be ""Peking or Tsinghua University"". But now no one could give the exact answer without hesitation . The only sure thing is that HK universities have gradually showed an unusual attraction to a great many mainland students.

How can HK universities shake the steady foundations of Peking and Tsinghua University and attract so many mainland students?
First, Hong Kong universities offer large-amount scholarship, especially for the top students who can receive the scholarship as much as 400,000 HK dollars. Since higher education has become a kind of heavy burden of many families, it's easy to understand why the reaction to the generous offering of HK universities is great.
Second, most HK universities receive professors and students from all over the world and carry out bilingual   education. This kind of excellent language atmosphere is another attraction for mainland students.
Furthermore, university students in Hong Kong have a better chance to study abroad as exchange students.
Can mainland top universities like Peking or Tsinghua University be calm as before when facing the unexpected competition from HK? Will they take relevant measures to win back the top students who once help them set the worldwide reputation? Time will explain it .
The fierce competition brought by HK universities can be a good thing for an entire improvement of education in China. After the awakening and action-taking of mainland universities , they can perform better together with HK universities.
At least, it reminded the mainland universities the tuition fees   are among students' top concern when they are choosing universities . It's time to move.",high15271.txt
