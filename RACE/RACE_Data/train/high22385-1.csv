1,B,"['How John H. Johnson became somebody', 'The mental   support from a great mother', 'The importance of a good education', 'The key to success for blacks']",What's the best title of the passage ?,"John H. Johnson was born in a black family in Arkansas City in 1918. His father died in an accident when John was six . He was reaching high school age , but his hometown offered no high school for blacks .
Fortunately   he had a strong -- willed , caring mother . John remembers that his mother told him many times , ""Son , you can be anything you really want to be if you just believe ."" She told him not to be dependent on others , including his mother . ""You have to earn success,"" said she . ""All the people who work hard don't succeed , but the only people who do succeed are those who work hard .""
These words came from a woman with less than a third --grade education .She worked hard as a cook for two years to save enough money to take her son -- then 15--to Chicago .
Chicago in 1933 was not the promised land   that black southerners were looking for . John's mother and stepfather could not find work . But here John could go to school , and here he learned the power of words -- as an editor   of the newspaper at Du Sable High School . His wish was to publish a magazine for the blacks .
While others discouraged him , John's mother offered him more words to live by : "" _ "" She also let him pawn   her furniture to get the $500 he needed to start the Negro magazine .
It is natural the difficulties and failures followed John closely until he became very successful . He always keeps his mother's words in mind: ""Son , failure is not in your vocabulary ."" Now John H. Johnson is one of the 400 richest people in America .",high22385.txt
