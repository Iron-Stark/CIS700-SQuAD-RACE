Mr.White, a man with a kind heart, found it difficult to refuse to give the money, though he himself was poor.Tom had already received more than thirty pounds from Mr.White, but he always seemed to be in need of some more.
One day, after telling Mr.White a long story of his troubles, Tom asked for five pounds.Mr.White had heard this sort of thing before, but he listened patiently to the end.Then he said,""I understand your difficulties, Tom.I'd like to help you.But I'm not going to give you five pounds this time.I'll lend you the money, and you can pay me back next time you see me.""
Tom took the money, but he never appeared again.",middle1877.txt
