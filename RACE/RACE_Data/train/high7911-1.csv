1,A,"[""In the sky, you can't cry"", ""In the sky, you can't burp"", 'No Gravity, no tears', 'Better life with gravity']",What can be the best title of this passage?,"Entering Space, astronauts can give us a fascinating account of a shuttle flight, describing the pressure of a countdown and launch, the complexities of living the days in the strange weightless environment, the challenges of working in space, the emotional effect of seeing earth from space, the drama of the meteoric landing.
However, there are also plenty of things that astronauts can't do because of their weightless environment, and that's very sad. What's more, they can't even let their sadness show, because it's impossible to cry in zero gravity.
Of course, astronauts can still produce tears. But crying is much more difficult in space, reported The Atlantic in January. Without gravity, tears don't flow downward out of the eyes like they do here on Earth. This means that when you cry in space, your tears have nowhere to go - they just stick to your eyes.
In May 2011, astronaut Andrew Feustel experienced this during one of his spacewalks. ""Tears,"" he said, ""don't fall off of your eye... They just kind of stay there.""
Besides making your vision unclear, this can also cause physical pain. Back on Earth, tears are supposed to bring comfort to the eyes. But that's not the case in space. The space environment dries out astronauts' eyes, and when tears suddenly wet the eyes, it can cause pain rather than comfort. ""My right eye is painful like crazy."" Feustel told his teammate during the walk.
Since gravity doesn't work in space, astronauts need some extra help to get rid of the tears. Feustel chose to rub his eyes against his helmet to wipe the tears away. Another choice is to just wait - ""When the tears get big enough they simply break free of the eye and float around,"" astronaut Ron Parise told The Atlantic.
There are lots of small things - things like crying - that we are so used to on Earth. We usually take them for granted, until they become a problem in a totally different environment, like space. There, astronauts can't talk to each other directly. They also can't eat or drink in normal ways. They can't even burp  , because there is no gravity to hold the food down in their stomach. If they do burp, they just end up throwing up   everything in their stomach, according to the UK National Space Center.
Thus, perhaps it's only space explorers who can honestly say: ""Gravity, you're the best.""",high7911.txt
