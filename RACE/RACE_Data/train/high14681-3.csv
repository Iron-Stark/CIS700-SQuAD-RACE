* London Underground
There are 11 colour-coded Underground lines. Services run regularly from around 5:00 to 00:30 (Sunday 07:30 to 23:30).
Visit tfl.gov.uk/tube for more information.
Tip:
Always stand on the right when using the escalators   at Tube stations. It can get hot and busy on the Tube during peak travel times, so you may prefer to travel outside these hours.
* Buses
A cheap and easy way to travel around London. They generally run from 5:00 to 00:30. Night buses operate on many major routes from around midnight to 05:00, and some operate a 24-hour service.
It is not possible to pay for your London bus fare in cash. Instead you can pay with a Visitor Oyster card, Oyster card, Travelcard or UK-issued contactless payment card. A single bus journey is PS1.50 with an Oyster card or UK-issued contactless payment card.
To help you get home, if you don't have enough credit   on your Oyster card, you will be able to make one more bus journey.
After this you will need to add the credit on your card before you use it again. If your contactless payment card has been issued outside the UK, please check tfl.gov.uk/contactless before you use your card to travel on our bus services.
For more information visit tfl.gov.uk/buses.
Tip:
Some bus routes are especially good for sightseeing --- try routes 9, 14, 15 and 22. The New Routemaster bus featured in the James Bond film Skyfall and runs on routes 9, 11, 24, 38 and 390.",high14681.txt
