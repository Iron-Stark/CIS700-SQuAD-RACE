2,A,"['A Rock Star in the Climbing World', 'The First Female Rock Climber', 'A Most Influential Teenager in America', 'The Champion of American National Youth']",The passage mainly focuses on   _  .,"Veteran rock climbers are calling her one of the most promising climbers in the world. She flies up, grasping the rock and heading gracefully for practically non-existent holds. She's only 14. Ashima Shiraishi, the New York-born teen, has shaken up the climbing world. At 1.55 meters and 45 kilograms, Ashima might not look like the groundbreaking athlete. But she could be, though still young, the first female climber whose accomplishments go beyond gender.
The evidence: At just 14, Ashima has already made history in the sport. She won the American National Youth Bouldering Championship every year from 2010 to 2014. And last March, the young climber completed the ""Open Your Mind Direct"" course in Spain. It's a very big deal because the course, with a hold broken off near the top, is widely considered one of the hardest in the world. Only one woman and a small number of men have ever conquered it. She first learned to climb on rocks in Central Park when she was only six. Her father, who works as a dancer, is her coach. At age nine, Ashima went on a bouldering trip to Texas. Falling brought tears to her eyes, but she didn't give up. Now, she finds she ""couldn't live without climbing.""
For the past six years, Ashima has been a climbing legend. Her love for the sport has taken her around the world. There have been articles and photo spreads in newspapers and sports magazines, films, countless online video clips, and an appearance on Time Magazine's list of America's most influential teenagers.
""I think people are shocked if I do something they can't do or because I'm still very young and I'm a girl,"" Ashima says. ""In most sports, men lead the way. But with climbing, who knows, maybe women will be leading. Doing something that a guy can't do is pretty special.""",high13646.txt
