He was always asking his father and brothers 'What?' and 'How?' and 'Why?'
They couldn't always tell him what he wanted to know.
When they couldn't tell him, Ben tried to find out for himself.
Many times Ben did find out things that no one knew before. The other boys would say, 'That is Ben Franklin! He's always finding out something new!'
Ben lived close to the water. He liked to go there to see the boats. He saw how the wind blew them across the water.
One day Ben said to himself: 'Why can't the wind help me float across the water? And I'm going to try.' Ben got his big kite.He took hold of the kite string and ran with it. The wind took the kite up into the air.Then Ben jumped into the water.
The wind blew the kite high into the air.Ben began to float across the water.Soon he was on the other side, and he had not worked at all.
One boy shouted, 'Look at Ben floating across the water! His kite takes him to the other side without any work!'
'Yes,' said another. 'He's always finding new ways to do things.'",high4852.txt
