Finally, there was only one family between the ticket counter and us. This family made a big impression on me. There were eight children, all probably under the age of 12. You could tell they didn't have a lot of money. Their clothes were not expensive, but they were clean. They were excitedly talking about the clowns, elephants, and other acts they would see that night.
The father and mother were at the head of the pack, standing proud as they could be. When the ticket lady asked the father how many tickets he wanted, he proudly answered, ""Please let me buy eight children's tickets and two adults tickets, so I can take my family to the circus.""
The ticket lady told him the price. The man's wife lowered her head. The father`s lip began to quiver and he leaned a little closer and asked, ""How much did you say?""  The ticket lady again quoted  the price. The man didn`t have enough money.
How was he supposed to turn and tell his eight kids that he didn`t have enough money to take them to the circus? Seeing what was going on, my dad put his hand in his pocket, pulled out a $20 bill and dropped it on the ground. My father reached down, picked up the bill, tapped the man on the shoulder and said ,""Excuse me, sir. This fell out of your pocket.""
The man knew what was going on. He wasn`t begging for a handout but certainly appreciated  the help in a heartbreaking and embarrassing situation. He looked straight into my dad`s eyes, took my dad`s hand in both of his, holding the $20 bill, and with a tear running down his cheek, he replied, ""Thank you, sir. This really means a lot to me and my family .""
My father and I went back to our car and drove home. _",middle6328.txt
