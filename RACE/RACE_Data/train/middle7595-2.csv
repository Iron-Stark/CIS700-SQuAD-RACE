2,C,"['For more than eight years.', 'For more than five years.', 'For three to five years.', 'For less than three years.']",How long will it take Doctor Humayun to produce his bionic eye?,"There are millions of people throughout the world who are either born blind or have become blind over the course of their lifetimes. It is unfair to take away the visual beauty of the world from these people. Doctor Humayun has created the world's first bionic eye that could change the life of every blind people in the world.
Doctor Mark Humayun is a well respected professor at the Doheny Eye Institute in California. He has been working for years on creating a bionic eye that would allow blind people to see images just like a normal person does. His idea of the bionic eye is actually an eye that has been built in a small video camera.
The test results show the bionic eye has given blind patients the amazing ability to see the scientists doing the tests. But the images are still blurry  and we need much work before the eye actually becomes a regular implant  into blind people. Humayun believes that he can go into production with the bionic eye over the next three to five years.
A closer look at the bionic eye is amazing. The patient wears a special set of eyeglasses. All the signals  are passed to the implanted eye. It's done by wireless technology. Humayun has created an invention that could change the lives of millions of people. Imagine a world in which someone would no longer fear about being blind. This could be considered a technological achievement.",middle7595.txt
