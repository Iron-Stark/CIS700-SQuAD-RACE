3,C,"['the writer only has one child', ""everyone in the writer's family likes playing the game"", 'the writer wrote this passage to the parents', ""everyone in the writer's family has to do the chores every day""]",We can learn from the passage that   _  .,"Chores were not popular at my house.My children didn't like to do chores.They always saw me do
chores, but they hardly ever helped me do them.
A year ago, I made a game called ""The Endless Chore Game"".It's really great.Here's how the game works.
I made a card with forty squares ( ) and I write a different chore on each square.These chores can be easy and interesting like making dessert.Then my family roll the dice  to decide what chores we have to do.The card also has a few squares with fun things, like watching TV and singing.If you are lucky, you can watch TV when the others are doing the chores.
My son likes the game very much.He goes to the kitchen happily every morning to do the game.It is really a good way to make my children do chores.You can have a try if you have the same problem with me.",middle5572.txt
