0,B,"['Lee Se-del won AlphaGo 4-1.', 'Lee Se-del was defeated.', 'Google program beat AlphaGo.', 'Neither side won the match.']",What was the result of the match?,"Who is smarter? A human being or artificial intelligence ?
The question swept the world last week when a Google-developed program called AlphaGo defeated the world top player, South Korean Lee Se-del, 4-1.
So, what comes next?
Some people have been arguing that artificial intelligence, or AI in short, will be a bad thing for humans. In an interview with the BBC in 2014, UK scientist Stephen Hawking warned that ""the development of full artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race.""
So are we really about to live in the world shown in the Terminator movies?
   ""Not quite,"" answered The Economist. After all, it's not hard to get a computer program to remember and produce facts. What is hard is getting computers to use their knowledge in everyday situations.
""We think that, for the human being, things like sight and balance , are natural and ordinary in our life."" Thomas Edison, founder of Motion Figures, a company that is bringing AI to boys, told the newspaper. ""But for a robot, to walk up and down just like human beings requires various decisions to be made every second, and it's really difficult to do.""
As The Economist put it, ""We have a long way to go before AI can truly begin to be similar to the human brain, even though the technology can be great.""
Meanwhile, John Markoff of The New York Times said that researchers should build artificial intelligence to make people more effective.
""Our fate is in our own hands,"" he wrote. ""Since technology depends on the values of its creators, we can make human choices that use technology to improve the world."".Com]",high19783.txt
