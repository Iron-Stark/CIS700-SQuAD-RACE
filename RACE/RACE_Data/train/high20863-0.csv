Would you mind lying in a coffin  ? Would you shave your head? Are you willing to take out your false teeth?
These are just a few of the questions Anne Marie Stewart and her staff sometimes ask the ""talent"" who serve as non-speaking ""extras"" in special films, television series, and made-for-TV movies produced in Toronto.
Of course, the majority of extra calls are for more ordinary people, and Stewart has a list of about 650 registered extras. Crowd scenes, which are common, call for everyday people of all ages, ethnic backgrounds, and sizes.
Over at Movie People, last-minute requests are not unusual. ""We got a request once for an entire brass band of 30 people. They wanted it within the hour,"" said manager Yvonne McCartney. Another time, the company got a last-minute request for a newborn baby. ""We found a baby that was three weeks premature,"" said Jonathan Aiken, an owner of the company.
Then there was the worried call from a casting director whose ""Star"" got doggone stubborn one day and decided to just lie down and not work. The director needed a replacement dog, fast. ""We got them two in one hour."" said Aiken. ""It was a matter of good connections and fast phone work."" The eight phone lines needed to make 350 to 400 calls a day are one of Movie People's major expenses.
Phone lines are the only way to stay in touch with casting directors and extras; but the latter are a group not necessarily interested in a long-term relationship. Most extra jobs pay only $7 an hour (with a six-hour minimum), while most agencies charge an annual $75 registration fee and get 10 to 15 per cent of extras' earnings. It's no wonder that the  _ rate is fairly high.
Some people who are between jobs do extra work as a temporary measure, said McCartney. But professionals, such as lawyers, also do the work because it's interesting. Others with flexible jobs have a desire to do something different. Some homemakers want to get out of the house and onto a movie set. Money's not the motivating reason.
""One of the first things I say to people who walk in and ask about being an extra is, 'You have to be available,' ""said a person at Karen Clifton Agency. Inc. ""The next thing I say is, 'You can't make a living at this.' """,high20863.txt
