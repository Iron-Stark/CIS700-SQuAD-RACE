3,C,"['Ipod--out of date MP3 player', 'Ipod--out of date mobile phone', 'Skinny Player--new type of MP3 player', 'Skinny Player--new type of mobile phone']",The best title for this passage can be   _  .,"The disadvantage you usually find about MP3 players like the iPod is that they are too big. But get ready for the MP3 player in your hand to get much smaller--the size of a Band-Aid  .
It's called the Skinny Player, and it's being designed by industrial designers Chih-Wei Wang and Shou-His Fu. Unlike the current types of iPod Shuffles and iPod Nanos, the Skinny Player does not need to be fixed onto your clothes or put into your pocket. It could stick to your skin  like you would attach a Band-Aid. But unlike Band-Aids, this tiny MP3 player will not lose its stickiness as you pull it off for the hundredth time.
The Skinny Player features flexible speakers allowing the user to enjoy music conveniently. When it gets dirty, the user can simply clean it using a damp cloth. No batteries either. The Skinny Player's designers say it will be powered by body heat, using a flexible battery charging device  that is in contact with skin whenever the player is being used.
The design only include an on/off button and flexible speakers, no word yet on arranging the volume. Besides, the memory capacity  won't be the best, as it is designed to only store one album.
The small size and the ability to stick it onto your skin like a Band-Aid should make the Skinny Player perfect for runners who now depend on their iPod to keep them energized on the running path.",high20170.txt
