*We design and personalize your tour to fit your desires and needs.
*We are Spain insiders: we are located in Spain and we know the country.
You get the tour you want. You do not have to follow a schedule, but we encourage you to make your own with our help. If you have a few cities in Spain that you want to visit or a specific theme for your tour that needs some fine-tuning , we can do it for you. On the contrary, if you are not sure what's here and need some extra help, we can help you. We can assist you in developing the tour that fits you and your students.
You get more for your money. Yes, it may cost you the same price as with the other companies--usually less--but you will receive more in return. With any other company you will be mixed with other groups. With SpainExchange, your tour is for yourself and your students only: your group alone will be in your bus; your students will be housed in double rooms; they will have 2 paid meals per day, and your entrance fees will be on us.
Your students will have an educational experience they'll never forget. The students will learn about world history, not just Spanish history, art history, archeology, Spanish culture, and much more. Many students have ""fallen in love"" with Spain and make plans for future studies here. And teachers are amazed at how much Spain has to offer. As one teacher said, ""I can't wait to come back and see the rest.""
Only a professional Spain insider that is flexible to design the tour that fits your group can provide all that for you. Just tell us what you want and enjoy the ride.",high16047.txt
