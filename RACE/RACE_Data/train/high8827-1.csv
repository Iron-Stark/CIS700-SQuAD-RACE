1,C,"['sad and self-focused people are poor', 'sad people make important decisions easily', 'tragedies may make people buy more expensive goods', 'sad people are less confident than calm people']",We can learn from the passage that  _  .,"The best way to cure sadness is not shopping, according to a recent study. The so-called shopping method has become common practice these days, but that can put your wallet under a lot of pressure. So if you are sad and feel like shopping, don't!
According to the recent study, sadness leads to self-focus   thinking. In other words, sad people are willing to spend more money on the same thing than calm people.

In a perfect situation, when you know you are sad, you should avoid  making decisions and spending money. Sounds simple? Sadly, it is not. Most people don't even know they're sad, the study shows, and they are not aware that their feelings influence their decisions.
