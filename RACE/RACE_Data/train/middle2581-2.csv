2,D,"['She has so many children.', 'She loves her children.', ""She doesn't want to take her children home"", 'She wants to see her children easily among others']",Why does the woman dress her children in the same clothes?,"One day Mr Brown sees a young woman with several children in the street. He is very surprised  because all the children are wearing the same clothes. White caps, blue coats and yellow trousers. ""Are all these children yours?"" he asks the woman. ""Yes, they  are,"" she  answers. ""Do you always dress them in the same clothes? "" asks Mr Brown. ""Yes,"" answers  the  mother. ""When we have four children, we dress them in the same clothes because we don't want to lose any of them. It is easy to see our children among other children because they are all wearing the same clothes. And now we have ten, we dress them like this because we don't want to take other children home by mistake . When there are other children among ours, it is easy to see them because their clothes are different.""",middle2581.txt
