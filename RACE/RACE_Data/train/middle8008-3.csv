3,B,"['Stay in bed until lunchtime', 'Watch football games on TV', ""Go to his friend's house"", 'Go shopping in the markets']",What does the writer NOT do on weekends?,"Monday.....oh, I don't like Monday because I will  have to go back to school again after the weekend. Tuesday is not so bad. I usually play tennis with my friends after school. On Wednesday evening I don't go out. I stay at home and do my homework. I like Thursday because the next day is Friday. I always go out on Friday -maybe to the cinema. I love the weekend. On Saturday I stay in bed until lunchtime, and I sometimes go to the shops in the afternoon. In the evening we go to a club--there are good bands there every Saturday. Then on Sundays I go to my friend's house or she comes to mine. I usually visit my grandmother for an hour in the afternoon. Then the weekend is over and it's Monday.... And I feel bad again!",middle8008.txt
