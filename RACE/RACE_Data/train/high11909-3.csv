3,B,"['Stop flushing your toilet!', 'Do you flush the toilet every time?', ""Don't forget to flush the toilet after peeing!"", 'Do you realize the importance of saving water?']",Which of the following titles best suits the text?,"I have to admit: I don't flush  the toilet every time I go to the bathroom. In fact, I firmly believe ""If it's yellow, let it mellow; if it's brown, flush it down.""
I'm sure a lot of it has to do with the fact that I work at home. Alone (well, except for the cats and dog). All day. And I drink a lot of water, which makes for many trips to the bathroom.
Another thing I have to admit: I also try to use very little toilet paper. I wash my hands after, though. Every time. (So maybe the water I don't use flushing makes up for the water used to wash my hands?)
Ironically, my husband, who only uses toilet paper when necessary, always flushes. But he doesn't seem to mind that I don't flush every time. Or, at least not enough to file for divorce. Yet.

When I'm at home alone I do not flush every time I pee .  My husband hates that, though, so when he's home, I flush a little more often.  I grew up doing that because I had a family that lived with huge tanks and you have to do it that way because it's easier on the system, so it doesn't bother me.  I do flush when I'm out in public, at people's houses that don't have big tanks and when we have company!

Not always. But I have 4 children who are always hanging from the door knob  while I pee anyway. So I'm lucky I have time to wash my hands after. The average toilet uses 8 gallons of water per flush! Much less than what it takes to wash my hands after. (just saying)
