2,A,"['two hours', 'three hours', 'six hours', 'over seven hours']","It took Tom   _   to buy the ""stamps"".","Children always did not do what their parents wanted them to do. They did the things in their own ways. But they always made their parents very happy. Old Mr. Brown had a little son named Tom. He was ten years old. He was very happy when his father wanted him to buy something for him. One day at five o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Brown gave him two pounds and let him buy some stamps in the post office. Tom was very excited, because for a long time he did not have so much money. Mr. Brown told him clearly where the post office was. He expected(,) that he would come back in twenty minutes. But nearly two hours passed, Tom did not return. Mr. Brown was surprised . ""He lost his way?"" he thought to himself.
At seven in the evening, Tom came back with a box. He was very tired. When he saw his father, he said, happily, ""Daddy, I ran out all of your money to buy a box of chocolates. It was very sweet , but didn't you think a box of chocolates was quite heavy for a little boy?""",middle2530.txt
