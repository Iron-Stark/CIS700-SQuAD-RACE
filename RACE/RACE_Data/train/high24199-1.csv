1,A,"['she has never had Janie as anything except a driver', 'she has made only a few friends in the school', 'she had hardly thought of herself', 'she had never listened to others']",Why did the writer feel selfish?Because  _  .,"""It's over!Thank goodness!""
   School was over and I was tired.I sat at the front of the school bus.
   Janie,the driver,tries to break the uncomfortable atmosphere by striking the match of talks.I try to listen politely,but usually I am too busy thinking about my day.On this day,however,her talk was worth listening to.
   ""My father is ill,:she said to no one in particular.I could see worry in her eyes.I had never seen her like this before.She always meets students with a smile.
   With a sudden change of interest,I asked,""What's wrong with him?""
   With her eyes wet and her voice unusual,she answered,""Heart trouble.""Her eyes lowered as she continued,""I have already lost my mum,so I don't think I can stand losing him.""I couldn't answer.My heart ached for her.
   I sat on the seat thinking of great pain my own mother was thrown into when her father died.I saw how hard it was,and still is,for her.I wouldn't want anyone to go through that.
   Suddenly I realised Janie was not only a bus driver,that was just for her job.She had a whole world of family and cares too.
   I suddenly felt very selfish.I paid no attention to Janie because she was a bus driver,I had judged her by her joband brushed her off as unimportant.I shouldn't have been so selfish and self-centered.",high24199.txt
