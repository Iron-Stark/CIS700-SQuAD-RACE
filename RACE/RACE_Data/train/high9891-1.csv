1,A,"['quite angry', 'very excited', 'quite puzzled', 'very curious']","When the homeless man saw the author first, he was   _  .","It was very cold and I had been watching a homeless man make himself comfortable in a ""shelter"" on the river bank. His ""shelter"" was a tarpaulin   tied to rocks to keep the wind from blowing it away. He had been living there for over a month. I never saw him with warm clothing or food. I knew what I wanted to do.
When I told my parents what I wanted to do they were _ . They said I could be putting myself at risk, taking a box to a homeless person at night! But I knew, in my deep heart, that I would be safe.
I got a box. My parents watched as I added warm gloves, a heavy blanket ... into the box until it was full! Then, I put a Christmas card on top. It said, ""Even though we hardly know each other, I want to wish you a Merry Christmas!"" I put ten one-dollar bills inside it as well.
My father insisted he went there with me as it was 10 pm on Christmas Eve. I said he could drive me but he had to stay in the car. He agreed.
I took the box and walked towards his ""house"". I called, ""Sir, I have a Christmas box for you!""
""Go away!"" he shouted.
""Sir,"" I repeated.
""Go away!"" he shouted.
""Why?"" I asked him.
He walked over and I expected to see an angry face. Instead I saw two of the most beautiful, gentle, blue eyes I have ever seen.
""Merry Christmas!"" I said.
""Why are you doing this?"" he asked.
""Because you matter to me,"" I said. With that I gave him the box.
Tears came to his eyes and he thanked me. I got back to the car and watched him carry the box like it was filled with gold. I didn't want to embarrass   him by watching him any more so Dad and I left.",high9891.txt
