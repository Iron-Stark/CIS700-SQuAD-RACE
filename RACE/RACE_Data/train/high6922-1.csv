Researchers at Royal Horticultural Society carried out an experiment to find that the voice of a woman gardener makes plants grow faster.
The experiment lasted a month and by the end of the study scientists managed to discover that tomato plants grew up two inches taller when women gardeners talked to them instead of male.
Sarah Darwin was the one making the plants registered the best growth. Her voice was the most ""inspiring"" for plants than those of nine other gardeners when reading a passage from The Origin of Species. The great-great-granddaughter of the famous botanist  Charles Darwin found that her plant grew about two inches taller than the plant of the best male gardener.
Colin Crosbie, Garden Superintendent at RHS, said that the finding cannot yet be explained. He assumes that women have a greater range of pitch  and tone  which might have a certain effect on the sound waves that reach the plant. "" _ ,""said Mr Grosbie.
The study began in April at RHS Garden Wisley in Survey. Scientists started with open auditions  for the people who were asked to record passages from John Wyndham's The Day of the Triffids, Shakespeare's A Midsummer's Night Dream and Darwin's The Origin of Species.[:Z,xx,k.Com]
Afterwards researchers selected a number of different voices and played them to 10 tomato plants during a period of a month. Each plant had headphones  connected to it. Through the headphones the sound waves could hit the plants. It was discovered that plants that ""listened"" to female voices on average grew taller by an inch in comparison to plants that heard male voices.
Miss Darwin said, ""I think it is an honor to have a voice that can make tomatoes grow, and especially fitting because for a number of years I have been studying wild tomatoes from the Galapagos Island at the Natural History Museum in London.""",high6922.txt
