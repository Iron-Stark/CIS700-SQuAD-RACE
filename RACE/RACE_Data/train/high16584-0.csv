0,A,"['high school students', 'school teachers', 'parents and teachers', 'married couples']",The author writes this passage probably for   _  to read.,"While most high school students spend most of their time worrying about who 
likes who, and different relationships between their classmates, I choose to focus on my school lessons and sports.
 When I was young, my mother encouraged me to develop and keep friendship with boys in order to build strong relationships. But she told me not to risk a good friendship with a boy with the title of boyfriend. It' s indeed a wise choice to stay friends with those of the opposite sex. In my opinion, even though some high school relationship might continue after graduation, the probability of them lasting much longer is so slim that there really is not a point to it.
 Firstly you have to think about such a question-- whether it is possible to hurt both of you, or even hurt both of your future husbands or wives. My second point is that you still can date if you hope marriage could possibly follow. Except this, there really is not any other reason for dating. Some students desire relationships for a chance to be romantic. While these are nice to have, there are many more important things at this point in our lives.
 The titles of boyfriend and girlfriend put too much stress on a relationship between high school students. Just staying as common friends may be the best choice for us. I strongly recommend we should deal with it in an appropriate way and follow our teachers' advice if necessary.",high16584.txt
