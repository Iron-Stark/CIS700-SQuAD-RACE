2,B,"['Because Daniel stole the money.', 'Because she wanted to give Daniel a chance to explain.', 'Because Daniel was very angry.', 'Because Spot was badly ill.']",Why did Daniel's mother talk with him?,"Mom:    Daniel, I need to talk to you about your behavior. Dad and I realize there is probably an explanation for why the house is so dirty, but you shouldn't have run out of the room and closed the door so hard like that.
Daniel:     Mom, I'm sorry, but I was so angry! You want me to act like an adult but you and dad treat me like a child. Why didn't you just ask me what had happened?
Mom:    Well, I know that grown-ups are supposed to make good decisions but sometimes we make mistakes. We were angry too. None of us stopped to think and we should have. Can you explain to me now why the house was a mess and what you did with the money we left?
Daniel: Spot was sick, Mom. Eric and I didn't want to call you and dad on your vacation, so I used the money you left and some of my own to take him to the vet. We stayed there and waited for him all day. That is why we didn't have time to clean the house.",middle751.txt
