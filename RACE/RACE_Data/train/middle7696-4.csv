4,B,"['sick', 'disabled', 'blind', 'deaf']","Which of the following word has the similar meaning to the word ""physically-deformed""?","One day, a physically-deformed man came to our college and on his back was a notice saying, ""Free shoe repairing for college students"".
Repairing shoes for free? Most of us didn't believe it, and some even thought that it was just a device  to the students who would have to pay for shoes once they had been repaired. But the man just smiled and said, ""Save your money to buy some books."" These words really surprised me and I talked with him, ""You need to make a living. Why do you repair shoes for us for free?"" He answered, while keeping on working, ""I'm an illiterate , but I know how important knowledge is for everyone. So I'd like to serve the students like you. I hope you can do well in your studies. In my opinion, money isn't everything in life.""
After the chat, I felt he was great compared with me. He, a physically-deformed man who couldn't walk without a wheelchair, still tried his best to devote  himself to society. I would like to thank him because he gave me a new direction in my life, and taught me what the true value of life is.
