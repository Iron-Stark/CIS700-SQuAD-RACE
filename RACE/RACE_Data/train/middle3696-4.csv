4,A,"['He never sees such a strange teacher', 'He is afraid of the teacher.', ""He doesn't like the classroom"", 'He is in the wrong classroom.']",Why is the new student confused?,"My English teacher is very funny. He has really long hair and wears an earring   on one ear. He likes to wear purple shirts and orange pants. He also uses all kinds of slang  words from the 1970s. When he likes something, he'll say it's really ""groovy"" . I think he played the guitar in a rock band when he was young.
One day, he walks into the classroom and sees that there is a new student. He asks him, ""Hey, man, what's happening?"" The student is very confused, but we all laugh because we know that the teacher is just saying hello. ""You're new, aren't you?"" the teacher asks. The student is surprised and says to himself, ""Is this a teacher? He looks strange."" Then he explains to all of us, ""Sorry. Maybe I'm in the wrong classroom.""",middle3696.txt
