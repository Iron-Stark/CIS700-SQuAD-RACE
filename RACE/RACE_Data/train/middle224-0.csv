Then she looked through the window at her neighbor across the yard. "" She is in my garden again. Those are my strawberries, not hers. Maybe I should call the police.""
Her friend, Doris, was sitting at the table with a cup of coffee in her hands. ""You want to call the police because she picks your strawberries?"" she asked.
""Of course,"" Molly answered angrily. ""What would you do if your neighbor walked into your yard without your _ and picked your strawberries?""
""I would say, better here the bees.""
""The bees don't take my strawberries.""
""But the birds do,"" Doris continued. ""That old lady only picks a few strawberries every year, and the only ones she picks are those you leave to the birds. Why don't you pick some of your good strawberries and give them to her?""
""Are you crazy? What are you thinking?'
""Don't you remember what happened when you were in hospital last year? She went to see you and gave you a pot full of chicken soup. When you give her the strawberries you can tell her that you still remember that.""
Molly was shocked. She had almost forgotten that little kindness because she was too angry. Then she picked a basket of good strawberries and went out. Through the window, Doris could see that the anger on Molly's face changed into a bright smile.",middle224.txt
