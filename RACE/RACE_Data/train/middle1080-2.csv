2,D,"['one child can go to school for nine years', 'a new school can be built', 'many children can go to school', 'a child can go to school for a year']","WithY=300,    _  .","Almost every child in big cities has the chance to go to school. Nine years' studying helps children to prepare for their future lives. In fact, many students can study for more than nine years. Not all children are so lucky.
There is a girl called Xiao Fang. She is eight years old and lives in a small village in Guangxi. When she was younger, she wanted to go to school, but she could not because her family was too poor. The schools were too expensive, so her parents kept her at home. Instead of studying, Xiao Fang worked in the fields with her parents.
Then Project Hope heard about Xiao Fang. It agreed to help Xiao Fang to go to school. Her wish came true, and now she is studying in a school. Unluckily, there are many thousands of children who can not go to school. You can help these children.
Project Hope also helps to repair school buildings.
All this good work costs money. Project Hope needs your help. If you give Project Hope Y=300, we can pay for one child to go to school for a whole year. With more money, Project Hope can build new schools. The money buys good desks, chairs, blackboards and books. To help us is to help Xiao Fang and many other children to have a good start in life.",middle1080.txt
