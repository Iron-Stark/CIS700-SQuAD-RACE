It's everywhere. For example, if someone does better than you, you will get annoyed because you want to be No. 1. We may become jealous of a best friend's top marks in an exam, or of the girl in art class who is praised by the teacher all the time. We get annoyed because these good things are happening to someone else but not to us.
   It's bad to feel jealous. We should be pleased with the things we have. But we still wish we had the money of this person and the talent of that person. Instead of sharing their happiness, we just feel jealous and unhappy with ourselves. And, too often, these feelings are expressed by  _ the people weenvy.
   However, envy is also a kind of compliment to others. We see that other people have styles and talents different from our own. By comparing ourselves with others, we can know what we lack. And we can turn this comparison, the envy of others, into a kind of power.
   Therefore, being a bit jealous of others lets us know what we are like and what we want to be like. It can push us to become what we really want to be.
