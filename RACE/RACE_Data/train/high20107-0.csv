0,D,"['the course is suitable for students of all levels', 'the course will ensure your success at university', ""you can't go to university without taking the course"", 'the course emphasizes the application of skills']",From the passage we can learn that   _  .,"Gateway Academy Pre-Sessional Courses
Our pre-sessional courses are ideal for students who have a conditional place at a British university, but who need to achieve a certain level of English in order to be accepted. The course aims to provide students with the English language and study skills that they need in order to be successful at university or another academic establishment. It is important to note that completion of the course does not guarantee students' entrance into a university. It is necessary for students to show during the course that they have understood the information and skills that they have been taught, and can apply them to their work. 
Pre-sessional students at Gateway Academy will benefit from:
* Small class sizes (no more than 10 students per class)
* Twenty three hours of tuition per week
* Individual support and tutorials
* Regular guest lecturers 
* The use of the Academy's study and recreational facilities, including the Language Library, the computer suite, and the academy's sports facilities.
* A varied social programme including evening entertainments and weekend excursions to popular tourist attractions and cities such as Stonehenge, Oxford and Stratford-on-Avon.
The course offers an all-around approach to learning, and covers reading, writing, speaking and listening skills. During the course, students will receive instruction on important techniques such as summary-writing, analysing essay titles, organising writing, note-taking in lectures, giving seminars and making presentations. Students will gain experience in working both individually and in groups. As part of the course, all students will work towards a 5000-word project in their own field of study. Students will receive guidance from their tutors on how best to conduct research and write it up effectively. Students will also work towards a presentation on the same subject.
There is no final examination. The attendance, successful completion of assignments and participation in class will be taken into account. Students will be given a full report on their progress at the end of the course. Students need to be aware that the course involves a great deal of coursework, which will require students to manage their time effectively.",high20107.txt
