0,C,"['in the evening', 'at night', 'in the morning', 'on weekends']",The old man went to meet his wife    _   .,"It was a morning, about 8:30 am, when an old man in his 80's reached my hospital to take care of his finger. He said he was in a hurry because he had an appointment at 9 am.
While taking care of his finger I asked him if he had another doctor's appointment this morning, as he was in such a hurry. The old man told me no, that he needed to go to the nursing home to have breakfast with his wife. I asked if she would be unhappy if he was a bit late. He replied that there was something wrong with his wife's mind and she hadn't known who he was since five years ago.
I was surprised, and asked him, ""And you still go every morning, even though she doesn't know who you are?""
He smiled to me and said, ""She doesn't know me, but I still know who she is.""",middle8230.txt
