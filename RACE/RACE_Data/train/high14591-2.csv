It was a hot afternoon and we decided to have an adventure in Stephanie's basement.As I opened the basement door, before us lay the biggest room, full of amazing things like guns, dolls, and old clothes.I ran downstairs, and spotted a red steel can.It was paint.I looked beyond it and there lay even more paint in bright colors like purple, orange, blue and green.
""Stephanie, I just found us a project for the day. Get some paintbrushes.We are fixing to paint."" She screamed with excitement as I told her of my secret plans and immediately we got to work.We gathered all the brushes we could find and moved all of our materials to my yard.There on the road in front of my house, we painted bit stripes   of colors across the pavement.Stripe by stripe, our colors turned into a beautiful rainbow.It was fantastic!

I understood when you made castles out of leaves, and climbed the neighbors' trees, but this! Come inside right now!"" I stood there glaring back at her for a minute, angry because she had insulted   my art.
""Now go clean it up!"" Mother and I began cleaning the road.Tears ran down my checks as I saw my beautiful rainbow turn into black cement  .
Though years have now passed, I still wonder where my rainbow has gone.I wonder if, maybe when I get older, I can find my rainbow and never have to brush it away.I guess we all need sort of _ to brighten our lives from time to time and to keep our hopes and dreams colorful.",high14591.txt
