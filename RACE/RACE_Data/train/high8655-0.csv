0,D,"['There are many news songs this week.', 'The article introduces from the first place song.', '""Do It Like A Dude"" is sung by Jessie J, Ariana Grande, and Nicki Minaj.', '""Habits (Stay High)"" is sung by a Swedish singer Ebba Tove Elsa Nillson.']",What is TRUE according to the passage?,"We're unleashing the five most popular songs in the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart, for the week ending November 15, 2014.
We don't get any new songs this week...but things do get shaken up a bit.
It all starts in fifth place, where Jessie J, Ariana Grande, and Nicki Minaj dip a notch with ""Bang Bang."" Jessie says she wanted to assemble this lineup for a long time - she says she only met the other two after the song went to number one on iTunes. Jessie also says she wanted to use Nicki five years ago on her debut single, ""Do It Like A Dude.""
Taking over fourth place is Maroon 5 with ""Animals."" This band has been around for 20 years...but not always under this name. The Los Angeles group formed in 1994 as Kara's Flowers, and released one album under that name in 1997. Four years later the members re-grouped as Maroon 5, and the rest is chart history.
Holding in third place is Tove Lo with ""Habits (Stay High)."" Where did that name come from? This Swedish artist's real name is Ebba Tove Elsa Nillson. ""Lo"" is Swedish for lynx - a species of wildcat that Tove says she fell in love with as a little girl.
After eight weeks, Meghan Trainor falls off the Hot 100 pedestal: ""All About That Bass"" falls to second place. Last week, she and Miranda Lambert sang this song at the Country Music Association Awards in Nashville, and Meghan kicks off a headlining North American tour next February in Vancouver, Canada.
Taylor Swift re-takes the Hot 100 title, with ""Shake It Off"" - giving her three total weeks at the top - but that's only the beginning of her phenomenal week. Taylor's 1989 album just opened at number one by selling 1.2 million domestic copies. That's the largest sales week since The Eminem Show sold 1.3 million copies, way back in 2002.
That's a wrap for this week, but as you know, the chart is always changing. Come back in seven days for an all-new lineup.",high8655.txt
