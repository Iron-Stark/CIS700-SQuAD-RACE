3,B,"[""She was murdered in Camara's home."", 'She had stayed in the city for 5 years.', 'She had just finished her degree before she was killed.', 'She called 911 before she was killed.']",What can we know about Morelli from the passage?,"The man who admitted to killing an Italian woman inside her East Harlem apartment said he was possessed by an ""evil spell  ,"" police said Thursday.
    Bakary Camara, 41, who once dated the murdered woman, penned his admission of guilt in a three-page letter folded in his pocket as he tried to kill himself after policemen burst into his home. Kelly, a policeman, said ""He says that there was an evil spell that was cast on him.""
Camara, who was in stable condition at St. Barnabas Hospital, was later charged with the murder of Rita Morelli.
    The 36-year-old woman was getting a degree at Borough of Manhattan Community College as she waited tables at Caffe Buon Gusto on the upper East Side, police said. Camara called 911 from a payphone after killing the lively Morelli on Nov. 23.
    Her body was later found in her E. 120th St. home. She was hanged and had knife wounds to her throat and chest.
    Policemen began dialing numbers from Morelli's cell phone and when Camara picked up, a detective recognized his voice as the man who called in the report of a dead body, police said. When officers went to Camara's home, he locked himself inside, forcing policemen to burst down the front door to catch him.
    ""He is standing there with a knife pointed at his chest,"" Kelly, a policeman, said. ""He makes threatening statements as to the fact that he killed the woman. He then stabs himself in the chest.""
Camara, who told police he served six years in prison for robbery back in his native country, was still waiting to be charged with murder Thursday.
    Morelli left her hometown of Spoltore, Italy, five years ago to fully experience the arts and music culture of the big city, her family said.",high17939.txt
