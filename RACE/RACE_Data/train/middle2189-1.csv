Many people want to learn it well. Here are some things that I want to say about learning it.
To learn English well, you need two things- _ and good learning methods  . Passion is the more important one. Why? Because passion makes you want to learn English. Learning methods only tell you how to learn it better and faster.
If you love learning English, you will learn it regularly   and spend much time on it. It will also be easy for you to remember new words and grammar rules.  _  For example, some people like history and know a lot about World War II. If you ask a person who doesn't like history to memorize all the facts, he probably can't do it.
When you don't want to learn English, you can do the following things.
First, imagine that you can talk to native speakers just as you talk in your mother language. Imagine yourself to be a manager in a foreign company. Imagine you're living in an English-speaking country.
Second, use English as much as possible. This is very important. The more you use English, the better you'll learn it. English is very popular, so you can use it everywhere. You can watch American cartoons, write English diaries, and read interesting books written in English.",middle2189.txt
