1,D,"['All the sailors refused to get into the water because it was too cold.', 'The captain knew that the fire the fishermen made was enough to warm the sailor in the water.', 'The captain succeeded in cheating the sailor.', 'It was the sailor who was cleverer.']",Which of the following statements is TRUE?,"There was once a captain who loved money so much that he cheated his sailors at the end of every voyage and took their wages.
On the last day of one voyage, the ship was in a small port. It was winter time, and the sea was very cold, so the captain said to his sailors, ""If one of you stays in the water during the whole night, I will give him my ship. But if he comes out before the sun appears, I shall get his wages.""
The sailors had heard about the captain's cheating, so they didn't trust him. But then one of them, who thought that he was cleverer than the captain, said that he would do it. He got into the water, and, though it was very cold, he stayed in it. When it was nearly morning, some fishermen lit a fire on the shore about half a mile away.
""You are cheating,"" the captain said to the sailor. ""The fire's warming you.""
""But it's half a mile away!"" said the sailor.
""A fire's fire,"" answered the captain. ""I have won.""
The sailor came out of the water, and said, ""Perhaps you think that you are clever because you have won my wages, but you can't cook a chicken.""
""I can,"" answered the captain.
""If you cook this chicken,"" said the sailor, ""I shall work for you without wages for seven years, but if you can't, you will give me your ship.""
The captain agreed, took the chicken and said, ""Where's the fire?""
""There it is,"" answered the sailor. ""On the shore.""
""But it's half a mile away,"" said the captain angrily.
""A fire's fire,' you said,"" answered the sailor. ""If it is enough to warm me in the water, it is enough to cook your chicken.""",high8208.txt
