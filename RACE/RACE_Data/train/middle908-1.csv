But many years ago, there were millions of rats in Newtown. They attacked  the cats and dogs. Sometimes a lot of them knocked down a man or woman walking home at night. The rats were very big in size and they hurt many people.
The government   ordered   everybody to kill rats. Most people were lazy, so they did not kill many. Then the government decided to pay some money for each dead rat. That made the people very happy. They killed thousands of rats every day. A government officer put all the dead rats in a big pile . Sometimes a man brought hundreds in one day.
After two weeks there were not many rats in the city, but people still brought many rats to the government office. The government officer thought that people were stealing   dead rats from the pile. He ordered his men to dig a deep hole and put the rats in it. Soon there were no more rats, and the government did not pay any more money.",middle908.txt
