0,A,"['Positive.', 'Indifferent(\n).', 'Negative.', 'Worried.']",What is the author's attitude towards giving children pocket money?,"""How should I give my children pocket money?"" is one of the most common questions asked by parents. ""Should kids receive pocket money when they get high marks at school, or lose pocket money if they don't help with the housework?"" are also common questions.
     Giving pocket money is an excellent way to develop children's independence. Children should receive pocket money as their small share of the family wealth, and they should share in doing the housework as well.
     Here are some ideas to help you use pocket money to develop your children's independence.
     Give pocket money regularly. Like adults, children should have a payday every week or two.
     Link pocket money with ages and needs. Provide spending guidelines; don't be afraid to let them know what you expect them to buy, and what not to. A child in preschool and lower primary school is sure to spend money on candies and other such things. But older children can be expected to buy their own lunches or bus tickets.
     Teach kids to set their goals. Encouraging children to save money for big things like bikes can help them learn about planning ahead.
     When given wisely, pocket money is an excellent way to develop children's independence. But at some time, perhaps when a child turns fifteen, it needs to be reduced or eliminated in order to encourage the child to get a part-time job and begin to earn his own pocket money.",high1539.txt
