He didn't wait until school was over, and hurried home to his grandfather. He told him his story angrily. ""He is really bad,"" the boy said, ""and I hate him.""
The grandfather said, ""Let me tell you a story. When I was a boy, I, too, sometimes hated others for what they did...""
As the boy listened carefully, the grandfather went on,""There are always two tigers inside my heart. One is good and kind. He gets on well with everything around him. But the other is bad and unfriendly. Even the smallest thing will make him angry. He fights with everyone all the time, and for no reason. He can't think carefully because he always hates others. It is difficult to live with these two tigers inside my heart. They both try to control me.""
The boy looked into his grandfather's eyes and asked,""Which tiger always controls you, Grandfather?""
The old man said slowly and seriously, ""The one that I feed. I always feed the good and kind tiger, so I never hate others and seldom get angry now.""
