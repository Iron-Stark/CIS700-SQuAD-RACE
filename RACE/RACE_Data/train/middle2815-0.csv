0,C,"['500 miles', ""24 hours' walk"", '11,000 feet', ""23 hours and 15 minutes' drive""]",What is the distance up and down all these three highest mountains in Britain?,"Imagine climbing the three highest mountains in Britain. Now, imagine climbing all three in 24 hours. That's what Rebecca Shedden, a British schoolgirl did and she's only eight years old. She is one of the youngest people who have arrived on top of Snowdon, Scafell Pike and Ben Nevis, the three highest mountains in Britain.
Rebecca and her dad finished the climb, a total of about 11,000 feet (3,353 metres), in 23 hours and 15 minutes. That includes the time spent driving to each mountain: a distance of 500 miles!
Climbing isn't new to this schoolgirl. She took her first trip up a mountain in her dad's backpack when she was just six months old!
""One of the best parts about this climb was Scafell Pike,"" said Rebecca. ""I've never walked in the dark before, and it was fun seeing all the sheep eyes as they ran around in the dark.""
Rebecca brought along food, water, a medical kit  , a hat, a map, a lamp, a camera to take photos and even a mobile phone in case   something went wrong. Along the way, she and her dad had fun by making up mountain songs.
""All my friends like to stay inside playing computer games, but I like being outdoors best,"" says Rebecca. Rebecca also enjoys swimming and skiing.
The young climber doesn't plan to stay on flat land for long. She wants to climb Mount Kilimanjaro, the tallest mountain in Africa. ""And I would like to climb Mount Qomolangma one day, too,"" she said.",middle2815.txt
