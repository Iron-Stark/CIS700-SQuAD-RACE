2,B,"['he was stupid', ""he didn't like people saying he was old"", 'he was old and weak', 'he was afraid of the sunshine']",The old man carried an umbrella with him because   _  .,"It was a beautiful spring morning, and the sun was warm but not too hot, so Mr Green was surprised when he saw an old gentleman at the bus stop with a big, strong, black umbrella   in his hand.
Mr Green said to him, ""Do you think we're going to have rain today!""
""No,"" said the old gentleman, ""I don't think so.""
""Then are you carrying the umbrella to keep the sun off you?"" ""No, the sun is not very hot in spring.""
Mr Green looked at the big umbrella again, and the gentleman said, ""I am an old man, and my legs are not very strong. I really need a walking-stick. But when I carry a walking-stick, people say, 'Look at the poor old man.' I don't like that. When I carry an umbrella in fine weather, people only say, 'look at that stupid  man.'""",middle2606.txt
