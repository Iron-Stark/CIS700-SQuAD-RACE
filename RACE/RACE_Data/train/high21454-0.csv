0,A,"['Uncomlbrtable.', 'Shocked.', 'Excited.', 'Wonderful.']",How did the author first feel about camping in Yosemite?,"The first night in Yosemite had been awfid.I hadn't been able to sleep and I was stuck in a too small tent with my wife and two kids.""Things haven't worked out.""I said to myself.But,like so many other things I complain before my morning coffee,this one was extremely off-key. Things weren't bad;they were good.
    A hundred yards away was Summit Lake.It was beautiful.We fired up the camp stove and boiled up a cup of coffee.Half an hour later,my 6-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen Peak Trail,getting ready to hike.We wouldn't make it all the way--young legs get pretty tired on a steep mountain path--but it didn't matter.We would see great views spread out below us,the volcanic ash that layered on the earth turning the melting snow a mysterious pink as the sun struck it.Later,during the hike,I felt stupid about my morning complaints.Everything had been worthwhile.It gave me great satisfaction to see my daughter so excited about the view from the mountain.
    Yes,camping is uncomfortable.But there's also something wonderful about being so close to nature.Just as importantly,there's something about getting young children out of their increasingly technology-filled comfort zones and forcing them to experience the non-cyber world around them.It's a good thing to reconnect every so often with the Great Outdoors.",high21454.txt
