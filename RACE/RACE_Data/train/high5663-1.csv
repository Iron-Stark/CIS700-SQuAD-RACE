1,C,"['They work as hard as women.', 'They spend as much time on courses as women.', 'They play a lot more than women.', 'They consider good grades to be an ""insurance policy"" for success.']",Which of the following about men is TRUE according to the passage?,"Women work harder than men at university and get better degrees as a result, according to a study at Brunel University.
The research, which followed 200 students for four years, found that women consistently outperformed men in their studies even though they had started their courses with almost identical A-level grades.
An analysis of the results showed that while 65 percent of female graduates were awarded, only 35 percent of male graduates did as well. Girls are known to outperform boys at school, but this research showed that trend continued at university.
Fiona Smith, who led the research, said, ""The research shows that the difference has something to do with schools in general.""
""It also shows something about the inequality for working women in terms of pay and promotion. Women work harder at school, harder at university, and do better at both, but they still receive less pay.""
The research found that female students were more faithful, less likely to miss lectures, and more likely to believe that their marks reflected their abilities than male students. Female students were also more likely to ask for and receive support from their professors.
Women were also more likely to choose their universities because they liked the courses offered.
In contrast, men were more likely than women to miss lectures due to ""other affairs"" and ""laziness"", and to believe that playing sports was an important part of university life.
Generally, people think that women's success comes from more emphasis on coursework, but the research showed that female geographers at Brunel did better in their exams than in their coursework.
Dr Smith said, ""Most women feel that getting good grades is the most important part of university life. They believe that they need to work harder in order to compete in the male-dominated   environment they will encounter at work. Good grades are viewed as an 'insurance policy' for success. Men, on the other hand, prefer going out and playing sports to academic work.""
""This research shows how important it is to get all young people working hard and teach them the value of higher education,"" he said.",high5663.txt
