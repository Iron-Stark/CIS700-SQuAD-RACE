0,B,"['reading is important for men', 'a lot of people are joining book clubs', 'all the people are reading their books', 'fewer and fewer people in the USA are joining the clubs']",It is reported that   _   in the United States.,"Reading is an important activity for many Americans. Today, thousands of men, women and children are members of groups to discuss the books they read.
No one knows how many Americans belong to reading groups called book clubs. Yet publishers  and bookshops report that more and more throughout the United States are joining the clubs.
Most of the clubs work the same way. Members read the same book at the same time. Then they meet to talk about the book. Members may be friends or people who live near each other. Or, they may be people who work together.
Book clubs may be for only women or only men. Or, they can be for husbands and wives together. Some are family groups where parents attend with their children. Children may belong to book clubs of their own.
Some book clubs in the United States are for husbands and wives. One woman says this is a great idea for a book club. She says husbands and wives often talk to each other only about their children, work, or money problems. ""Talking about books,"" she says, ""opens a whole new level of communication.""
American children belong to book clubs, too. They may be as young as four years old or as old as eighteen. Some children's clubs get help from the Great Book Foundation  . This educational organization provides lists of books to read. It also trains people to lead discussions about the books.",middle6538.txt
