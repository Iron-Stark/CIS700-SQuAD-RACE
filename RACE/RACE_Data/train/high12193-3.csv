3,C,"['The pitcher did not throw the ball to the first baseman.', 'The audience and the players from both teams cheered for him.', 'The opposing players failed to stop his running to home.', 'One of the opposing players ran to help him.']",Which of the following has nothing to do with Shay's becoming the hero for his team?,"Shay asked, ""Do you think they'll let me play?"" Shay's father knew that most of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their team, but the father also understood that if his son, mentally and physically disabled, were allowed to play, it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging and some confidence.
Shay's father approached one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay could play, not expecting much. The boy looked around and said, ""We're losing by six runs   and the game is in the eighth inning  .I guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him in to bat in the final inning.
Shay struggled over to the team's bench and put on a team shirt with a broad smile and his father had a small tear in his eye and warmth in heart. The boys saw the father's joy at his son being accepted.
In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few runs but was still behind by three. In the top of the final inning, Shay put on a glove and played in the field. Even though no hits came his way, he was obviously joyful just to be in the game and on the field. In the bottom of the final inning, Shay's team scored again. Now, Shay was scheduled to be next at bat. Would they let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the game?
Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was almost impossible. The first pitch   came and Shay missed. The pitcher again took a few steps forward to throw the ball softly towards Shay. As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball right back to the pitcher.
The pitcher could have easily thrown he ball to the first baseman and Shay would have been out and that would have been the end of the game .Instead, the pitcher threw the ball right over the head of the first baseman, beyond the reach of all teammates, The audience and the players from both teams started screaming, ""Shay, run to first! "" Never in his life had Shay ever run that far but made it to first base, wide-eyed and shocked..
Everyone should, ""Run to second!"" Catching his breath, Shay awkwardly ran towards second. By the time Shay rounded towards second base, the smallest guy on their team, who had a chance to be the hero for his team for the first time, could have thrown the ball to the second baseman, but he understood the pitcher's intentions and he too intentionally threw the ball high and far over the third baseman's head.
All were screaming,""Shay,Shay,Shay,all the way Shay."" Shay reached third base when one opposing player ran to help him and shouted, ""Shay, run to third."" As Shay rounded third, all were on their feet, crying,""Shay, run home!""Shay ran to home, stepped on the home base and was cheered as the hero who the who won the game for his team.
That day, the boys from both teams helped bring a piece true love and humanity into this world. Shay didn't make it to another summer and died that winter, having never forgotten being the hero and making his father so happy and coming home and seeing his mother tearfully hug her little hero of the day!",high12193.txt
