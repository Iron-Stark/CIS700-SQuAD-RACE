Volunteering has never been an easy task. But if you are one of us, you will make a difference. Anyone who wants to volunteer-whether you work full-time or part-time-can find a way to help in our area. Below is an easy how-to guide to becoming a volunteer in our school.
First, you need to complete an online volunteer form, which includes your personal information and volunteering experiences. The form is only on the school website. Once you are told that you can volunteer, you will only have to sign in with our clock system, wear your badge with your name on it, and when leaving, sign out to make sure your volunteer hours are recorded.
Things you need to remember:
1. Sign in with the clock system every time you are in school.
2. Wear your badge.
3. Sign out when you leave to make sure your volunteer hours are recorded.
Everyone, whether you are a volunteer or a visitor, will be asked to show one of the following to tell who you are in order to get past the school gate:
1. A driver's license in use;
2. A state-issued ID card;
3. A work visa;
4. A green card.
If you are interested in volunteering, please fill out a school volunteer form and return it to the school Volunteer Officer or front office. The school volunteer officer will call you to discuss ways in which you can help in our school.
