3,C,"['Losing His Way?', 'Fun All the Way?', 'Going My Way?', 'Help on the Way?']",What is probably the best title for the article?,"It seems that some people go out of their way to get into trouble. That's more or less what happened the night that Nashville Police Officer Floyd Hyde was on duty.
""I was on the way to a personal-injury accident in West Nashville. As I got onto Highway 40, blue lights and sirens   going, I fell in behind a gold Pontiac Firebird that suddenly seemed to take off quickly down the highway. The driver somehow panicked at the sight of me. He was going more than a hundred miles an hour and began passing cars on the shoulder. ""
But Hyde couldn't go after him. Taking care of injured people is always more important than worrying about speeders, so the officer had to stay on his way to the accident. But he did try to keep the Firebird in sight as he drove, hoping another nearby unit would be able to step in and stop the speeding car. As it turned out, keeping the Firebird in sight was not that difficult. Every turn the Pontiac made was the very turn the officer needed to get to the accident scene.
Hyde followed the Pontiac all the way to his destination. At that point he found another unit had already arrived at the accident scene. His help wasn't needed. Now he was free to try to stop the driver of the Firebird, who by this time had developed something new to panic about.
""Just about that time,"" Hyde says, ""I saw fire coming out from under that car, with blue smoke and oil going everywhere. He'd blown his engine. Now he had to stop. ""
""After I arrested him, I asked him why he was running. He told me he didn't have a driver's license.""
That accident cost the driver of the Firebird plenty -- a thousand dollars for the new engine -- not to mention the charges for driving without a license, attempting to run away, and dangerous driving.",high20346.txt
