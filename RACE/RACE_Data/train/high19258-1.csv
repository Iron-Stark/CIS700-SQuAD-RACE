Strott told the local newspaper, the Shropshire Star, that he encourages the pupils to have a good knowledge of the computer from a young age, but is concerned that too much screen time will affect the development of their social skills. He said that this over-reliance on digital devices ""erodes family time and they're missing out on messages from body language and facial expressions from those around them"".
According to the headmaster, the parents are happy with the movement. But what about the children? Nine-year-old Fred usually spends around two hours on his gadgets at home after school and around 12 hours on weekends. For him, the digital detox experience was ""really hard"". Fred spent it playing outside, especially basketball. He said that he'll probably engage in different activities from now on but he did miss his phone and online games.
