2,B,"['The HP computer was very cheap.', 'The writer built a new computer by himself at last.', 'The HP company managed to mend the computer at last.', ""Dad didn't like the newly-built computer at all.""]",Which of the following is true according to this passage?,"When I was young, my family got our first computer. As years went by, I wanted to get a new one, and my father agreed. We went to many stores and looked at many flyers  . At last we bought an HP computer.
During the first week, I noticed that our computer had some problems. I tried to fix it, but failed. Finally I had to phone the HP company. After five hours' hard work, the computer still did not work. My dad didn't have a choice but to return the whole thing.
A few days later, we decided that I should go on the internet and order some parts to build a new computer by myself.
It was not an easy thing for me to deal with it, but in the end I finished. From these setbacks  , I have learned, and now believe if the computer that I bought from the store didn't have problems, then I would not learn how to build a new one. Even though I spent lots of time on it, I know it wasn't a waste of time.
I now have a self-built computer, and I am very pleased.",middle5658.txt
