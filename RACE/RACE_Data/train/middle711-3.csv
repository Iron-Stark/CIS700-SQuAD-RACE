Because  _  .,"Mrs. Green's telephone number was three-four-six-three, and the number of the cinema near her house was three-four-six-four. So people often made a mistake and telephoned her when they wanted the cinema.
One evening the telephone rang and Mrs. Green answered it. A tired man said, ""At what time your last film begin?""
""I'm sorry,"" said Mrs. Green, ""but you have the wrong number. This is not the cinema."" ""Oh. It began twenty minutes ago,"" said the man, ""I am sorry about that. Goodbye."" Mrs. Green was very surprised, so she told her husband. He laughed and said, ""The man's wife wanted to go to the cinema, but he was feeling tired, so telephoned the cinema. The man's wife heard him, but she didn't hear you. Now they will stay at home this evening and the husband will be happy.""",middle711.txt
