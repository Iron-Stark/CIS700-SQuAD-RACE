For students in Shanghai, they are no longer just dreams. This week experts and law-makers in Shanghai had a meeting to talk about a new law . It is called the ""Shanghai Underage Protection Law "".
The law says students' diaries and letters are their secrets and ""Nobody can read them if they don't agree.""
Do your teachers sometimes say something bad to you? Maybe they send you out of the classroom because you fail to finish doing your homework. If this happens in Shanghai, you can stand up and say ""No"".
Shanghai students may have less homework because of the law. Class hours may become shorter for juniors next year, down from 45 minutes to 40 minutes in some schools.
The law also talks about students' health. According to the rules,""Smoking in these places full of kids is not allowed.""That means you can ask your teacher to stop if he smokes in a classroom.
The law makes schools safer for students. ""No dancing halls, Internet bars or computer game bars are allowed within(......)200 meters of a school gate."" the law says.
The law is great, right? Many students like it.
""My mom reads my diaries sometimes. I think she will be afraid if I tell her she is doing something against the law."" said Luo Jia, 13, at Shanghai Fuxing Junior School.
