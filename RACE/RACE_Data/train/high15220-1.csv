Edinburgh Young Caregivers Project
We work with young caregivers . We want to colour the lives of some of these young people by introducing them to someone who will try to understand them , listen , work towards agreed goals and have some FUN ! Is that person you ? Are you aged 18-25 ? Could you help and encourage a young person to recognize what they want and work towards getting it ? You can encourage and help someone and in return help yourself ! You will learn new skills and build on your own experience .
