2,D,"['Hospital rules.', 'A weather report', 'A free talk', 'A music program']",What program will follow this radio talk?,"Hello, listeners. Welcome to Henton Hospital Radio. Before our music program begins, I'm going to repeat some of our hospital rules.
The hospital can sleep 800 patients. There are 8 beds in each ward .The visiting hours are in the afternoon from 2:30 to 3:30 and in the evening from 7:00 to 8:00. But remember only two visitors at a time. Sorry about that, but you can see what would happen if we didn't have these rules.
The other rules are about our time schedule. We start quite early-you might not be used to that. We wake you at 6 o'clock, and breakfast is at 8 o'clock, lunch at noon. There's tea at 3:30 and supper is at 6' o clock.
You can see the ""No Smoking"" sign-we don't allow smoking in the wards. I'm sure you understand why. However, if you do need to smoke, there are some smoking-rooms for you.
You will find the radio switch  on the wall near your bed, with your own headphones, if you want to listen. It's our own hospital radio wishing you a quick recovery{}.",middle7870.txt
