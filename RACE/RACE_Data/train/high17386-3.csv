3,C,"['To warn people of the danger of a voyage.', ""To find out a man's inner world."", ""To tell us about a man's choice in a boat-sinking incident."", 'To present the love between a man and his dog.']",What's the purpose of this passage?,"When you hear about a man saving his dog from a sinking ship, it's hard not to be moved by the tale of an animal lover's bravery.But the story becomes slightly less heroic when you learn that the man saved his dog before his own wife.
But that's apparently what happened when Graham Annie and his wife, Cheryl, found their Yacht  sinking after it hit a rock, while on a voyage from East London to Madagascar. 
National Sea Rescue Institute North London station commander Geoff McGregor said all three were wearing life jackets.The 9-year-old Jack Russell terrier named Rosie was wearing a tailored life jacket equipped with a light.
""As the incident happened Graham sent a radio distress call for help and activated the EPIRB (a GPS beacon) but they were immediately forced to abandon ship,"" McGregor said in an interview, ""He first swam Rosie to the shore safely before returning for his wife, whose safety line had caught on the steering gear McGregor added.
The couple and their dog all made it out free of injury.Graham, a long-time volunteer with the National Sea Rescue Institute, said, ""it was humbling to have the shoe on the other foot and need to be rescued.""     
Some details have yet to come out.So, it's likely that Cheryl was in a position of   safety and Rosie might have been in a more dangerous position had she been left on the boat. The couple did not want to speak with the media about their rescue.So, for now, it's left to readers to find out Graham's priorities during their troubled time.",high17386.txt
