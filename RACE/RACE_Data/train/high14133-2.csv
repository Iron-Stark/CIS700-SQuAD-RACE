2,C,"['The author was too stupid to tell right from wrong.', 'Bill often offered his students coffee to please them.', 'Bill had clever ways to teach his students.', 'The author was often nervous before important tests.']",Which of the following statements is probably right?,"My life began similarly to most children but I grew up without knowing what a father or mother was. No one was there to teach me how to tell right from wrong. Because of this, I got into some bad habits and spent seven years as a boy on the street.
When I was 20, I was taken in a rehab clinic  . Inside I met Bill, my counselor  . He taught me a lot of things. The main thing was the gift of giving.
It was the night before an important test and I was very nervous. Bill invited me to go out for a walk to relax  me. As we walked and talked, Bill suggested we should go for a coffee. I told him I had no money when I got paid, and I offered to pay him back. He stopped then and looked at me in a serious, but loving way and said he was doing this because he wanted to. Then he said, ""One day when you'll be around someone who will need a coffee, you'll be able to buy it for them. That's how you can pay me back.""
I'm a primary school teacher now. My job is simple and I can buy young people coffee now. Bill taught me how to offer help to others.",high14133.txt
