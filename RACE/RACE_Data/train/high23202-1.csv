1,C,"['when he left Harare', 'when his mother died', ""after his father's second marriage"", 'after meeting a worker from the PCC']",Lovemore began to live on the streets   _  .,"At the Presbyterian Church in downtown Harare, Zimbabwe, 15-year-old Lovemore and other children crowd around tables in a small room, answering questions in their workbooks. Their uniforms are clean and worn with pride, and in many ways it would be difficult to distinguish this classroom from any other.
These children, like Lovemore, live at the Mbare bus station, a crowded, dirty and dangerous place for anyone, especially at night. Lovemore said that he started to face problems once his mother died and his father stopped paying school fees. When Lovemore's father remarried, Lovemore was forced onto the street, no longer welcome at home.
After meeting a worker from the Presbyterian Children's Club (PCC), Lovemore felt encouraged to take advantage of the opportunity to get an education. Since joining the program, he is always at the top of his class. He spends his mornings at the PCC, where he receives his only meals for the day. At night, he sleeps on the ground at the bus station. The few clothes he owns are hidden in secret places around town so that no one will steal them.
At the end of each day, Lovemore and his classmates take their books with them to study at night in the market square. ""We read by the street lights, but sometimes the guards drive us away.""
Each year, the top three students are given a chance to go to formal school. Those who successfully complete their grade-seven exams will be given a PCC scholarship to attend a boarding school , proving there is hope for forgotten children like Lovemore.
Started in 1996, the program provides free education, basic meals, health care and clothing to more than 70 children. ""There are people who care here, and other kids like me,"" Lovemore said. ""It feels like this is my family.""",high23202.txt
