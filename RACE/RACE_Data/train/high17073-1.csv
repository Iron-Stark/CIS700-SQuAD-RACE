1,D,"['In the first test, men did as well as women.', 'The research suggests that men should avoid jobs that involve multitasking.', 'The research suggests that no men can multitask and only women can.', 'When the tasks started switching quickly in the test, the women in the study were more likely to take extra time to think.']",Which of the following  is TRUE according to the article?,"YOU'VE lost your keys and your parents are both busy. If you had to ask one of them for help, whom would you pick?
  Before you give your answer, you should probably know that a new study found that women are better than men at multitasking  , especially if one of those tasks is searching for a lost item. That should help you choose.
  In the study, a team of UK researchers compared the performances of 120women and 120men in  a computer game involving tasks of counting and shape-recognition 
Men and women were equally capable when tasks were  handled one at a time. But when the tasks started switching quickly , men responded c) much slower than women.
To make the experiment more  relevant to everyday life, researchers tried a second test. A group of women and men were asked to complete a series of ""everyday challenges"" such as finding restaurants on a map and searching for a lost key in a field.
Once again, women outperformed men on the test, particularly in the key-searching task. ""It suggests that- in a stressed and complex situation - women are more able to stop and think about what's going on in front of them,'' researcher Keith Law of the University of Hertfordshire, UK, told the BBC,[ln contrast,] men had a slight impulsiveness ;they jumped in too quickly""
But where did women get the ability to keep organized under pressure? Researchers believe that it has its roots in evolution ,In early human communities, women had to keep an eye on children while cooking meals. Meanwhile, men only needed to focus on hunting.
Men might not be happy about this study. After all, many great pilots are men and they have to deal with lots of information at the same time too.
This is true, and researchers have their response. ""[We don't mean]that all men can't multitask, or that only women can,"" said Laws.[We are saying that] the average woman is better able to organize her time and switch  between tasks than the average man. There's no point denying these differences exist.""",high17073.txt
