You've been waiting an hour to eat breakfast but your guests are still sleeping.
""Unless you adjusted a time for breakfast the evening before, let your guests sleep-in and enjoy your breakfast without them. If possible, keep their breakfast warm. Or better yet, when entertaining it's always a good idea to have cold breakfast (as well as lunch, dinner and snack) food on-hand.""

""There is nothing wrong with saying 'John, you have been here a month and have not put in any applications. What can I do to help you get your resume together? I would like to make a plan that will assist you in getting back on your feet and allow me to eventually have my extra room back for guests that will soon be arriving.'""

You gave your friend a closet shelf for her stuff but her clothes are thrown all over the place.
""You should simply say 'I am happy to have you use my closet but your clothes seem to have a mind of their own. Would you mind keeping your clothes on the top shelf? It would make it easier for me to find my things when I am in a rush and looking for them. Thank you.'""
