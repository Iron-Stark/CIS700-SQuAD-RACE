2,C,"['After the year of 2023, the population will become less and less.', ""There's no need to carry out the family planning policy."", 'At the beginning of 2030s the aging problem will be worse than now.', 'In the year 2023, the population may be the least.']",What can we learn about the population in China from the passage?,"The State Council submitted   a bill which aims to allow couples to have two children if either parent is an only child. It focuses on adjusting and improving the family planning policy.
The State Council argues adjustment to the policy in the face of a steadily declining birth rate. The birth rate has remained relatively low and shows a tendency to fall further. The rate has dropped to between 1.5 and 1.6 since the 1990s, which means each Chinese woman of child-bearing age gives birth to 1.5 to 1.6 children on average. The working population began to drop in 2012 by 3.45 million every year, and it is likely to fall by 8 million each year after 2023.
The population aged 60 and above will reach 400 million and account for one-fourth of the total population in the early 2030s, up from one-seventh now.
""If the current family planning policy continues, the birth rate will continue to fall and lead to a sharp drop of the total population after reaching a peak,"" said Li Bin, minister in charge of the National Health and Family Planning Commission.
""It is the right time to make changes: The low birth rate is stable, the working population is still large and the burden of supporting the elderly remains relatively light,"" he added.
An increase in birth is expected if the policy changes but will not seriously affect the food supply, public education, health care or employment.
China's food safety and public service plans are designed to meet the needs of 1.43 billion population in 2020 and 1.5 billion in 2033. Even with the policy change, the total population will reach no more than 1.38 billion in 2015, Li said.",high13298.txt
