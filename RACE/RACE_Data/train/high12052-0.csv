0,A,"[""An English student will have difficulty understanding Li Bai's poems."", 'an English student will have some difficulty understanding Walt Whitman.', ""A Chinese student will have some difficulty understanding Du Fu's works."", 'An American student will have some difficulty understanding William Shakespeare.']",Which of the following is true according to the passage?,"It is of great importance for students to be able to get a feel for the rhythm and sounds of a poem---more so than for most pieces of prose  . This isn't always easy in a second language, and so listening to their teacher read the poem, or to a professional recording, perhaps by the poet or by an actor, is, I feel, necessary.
As with any listening activity, students will need some kind of preparation and task so that they can be actively engaged. They might be asked to check predictions that arose from a warm-up discussion, to compare their suggested rhyming couplets with the poet's, or to identify stressed words and syllables.
You might also want to get your students to listen to recorded or live discussions about poems. This can, for example, take the form of a couple of teachers or a group of students giving their views on a poem, or even an interview with the poet.
I'm a big fan of jigsaw listening because of the natural information gap. If your school has the facilities, you might like to:
divide your students into two, or even three groups
give each group a different cassette or CD and tasks to work on
then they come back together to share what they have learned.
Remember that your own enthusiasm is a key factor in any activity relating to literature in the classroom.
Finally, don't forget to encourage art for art's sake. Listening for pleasure, to poetry (or to anything else, for that matter), is to be fostered at every opportunity, because of the obvious benefits which include motivation, vocabulary acquisition and learner independence. Many good song lyrics   could be termed poetry and treated accordingly in the classroom, copyright rules permitting.",high12052.txt
