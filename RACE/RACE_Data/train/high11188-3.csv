3,D,"['Rethinking the value of higher education.', ""Investing wisely in their children's education."", 'Helping their children to bring their talent into full play.', ""Avoiding too much intervention in their children's education.""]",What suggestion does the author offer to parents?,"As a society we might want to rethink the time and money spent on education,so that these resources can benefit a greater percentage of the population.Ideally,both high schools and colleges can prepare individuals for the ever-changing roles.
High school degrees offer far less in the way of preparation for work than they might,or than many other nations currently offer,creating a growing skills gap in our economy.We encourage students to go on to college whether they are prepared or not,or have a clear sense of purpose or interest,and now have the highest college dropout rate in the world.
We might look to other countries for models of how high schools can offer better training,as well as the development of a work ethic and the intellectual skills needed for continued learning and development.
Meanwhile,the liberal arts become more important than ever.In a knowledge economy where professional roles change rapidly and many college students are preparing for positions that may not even exist yet,the skillneeded is one that prepares them for change and continued learning.
Learning to express ideas well in both writing and speech,knowing how to find information,and knowing how to do research are all solid background skills for a wide variety of roles,and such training is more important than any particular major in a liberal arts college.We need to continue to value broad preparation in thinking skills that will serve for a lifetime.
Students also need to learn to work independently and to make responsible decisions.The lengthening path to adulthood appears exacerbated by parental involvement in the college years.Given the rising investment in college education,parental concern is not surprising,but learning where and when to intervene willhelp students take more ownership of the outcomes of these increasingly costly educations.",high11188.txt
