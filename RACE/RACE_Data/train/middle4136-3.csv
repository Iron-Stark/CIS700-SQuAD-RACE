I got excellent marks because of my fine memory  . I could read and translate any text that I heard once but I couldn't make my own   sentences. My face usually turned red when my teacher wanted me to answer questions in English. A few months later, I had to pass an exam. I couldn't _ the novel with my own words, so I decided to learn the book by heart. I told my teacher 10 pages of the book. When the teacher understood what was happening, she stopped me and said, ""Gagik, you have a fine memory, but it's much easier to speak English.""
That day on my way home, I met a foreigner. He couldn't find the way to his hotel. To my surprise, I spoke to him in English and helped him find his hotel. I found speaking English was not so difficult if I didn't think too much about making mistakes. I thought that was the secret of learning to speak English. How happy I was!",middle4136.txt
