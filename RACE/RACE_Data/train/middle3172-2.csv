2,A,"['a newspaper', 'a poster', 'a science magazine', 'a guidebook']",The passage is probably taken from   _  .,"A 2-year-od boy is being described as a hero after using Face Time to save his mother after she was badly hurt.
According to a report from KGUN, Laura was trying to stop a fight between two dogs when one of the dogs bit  part of her middle finger almost completely off.
Laura tried to call 911 herself, but she said her hands were too badly hurt to make the call. "" I asked my daughters to call 911, and they're four, and they were quite afraid to even touch the phone, because it was covered in my blood ,"" Laura told KGUN.
The mother continued to lose a lot of blood and thought she would go into a deep sleep--until her 2-year-old son Bentley came up with a dishcloth from the kitchen. After cleaning some of the bold off his mother's iPhone, Bentley continued to use Face Time to call Laura's friend Connie.
""All I could see was his little forehead. I said 'Hi Bentley' and it was quiet for a little bit. Then I heard Laura shouting,"" Connie told KGUN.
Connie then called 911, and Bentley unlocked the door to let firefighters into the house.
Laura told KGUN she is very thankful for her little hero and has since taught all of her children how to call 911.",middle3172.txt
