3,C,"['to go worse', 'to start smoking', 'to smoke less than before', 'to do nothing']",The doctor wanted the old man   _  .,"Once an old man went to see a doctor. The doctor looked him over carefully and said, ""Medicine won't help you. You must have a good rest. Go to bed early, drink milk, walk a lot and smoke one cigar   a day. Go to the country place for a month.""
After a month the man came to see the doctor again. ""How are you?"" said the doctor. ""I'm glad to see you again. You look much younger."" ""Oh, doctor, I feel quite well now,""said the man. ""I had a good rest. I went to bed early, drank a lot of milk and walked a lot. Your advice certainly helped me, but that you told me to smoke one cigar a day almost killed  me first. It's no joke to start smoking at my age.""",middle4529.txt
