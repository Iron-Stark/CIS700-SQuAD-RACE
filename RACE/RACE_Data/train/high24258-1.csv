1,D,"['was kept in order by its own law', 'had nothing to do with each other', 'happened in an irregular way', 'was made by the personal God']",Einstein believed that everything in the universe_.,"Albert Einstein was probably the most famous scientist of the twentieth century. He changed scientific thinking in the modern world. He is generally considered as the greatest physicist who ever lived. What's more, he devoted a lot of his time and energy to working for human rights and progress.
In 1933, while Einstein was visiting England and the United States, the Nazi government of Germany took all his things away, including his position and his citizenship. Einstein then settled down in the United States. In 1939, Einstein, who loved peace--afraid of a world in which only Hitler would had an atomic bomb --tried hard to persuade President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a famous letter to have the United States start uranium research. That Germany, after all, had no bomb, and that the first bomb would fall on Japan, could not have been expected. After the war, Einstein never stopped working for peace and reducing the number of soldiers in the world.
Although he wasn't connected with any accepted religion , Einstein felt that trust in a personal God was too special an idea to be suitable to the God at work in this universe, but he never believed that the universe was one of chance or disorder. The universe to him was one of pure law and order. He once said, ""God may know everything, but he is not hateful.""",high24258.txt
