2,A,"['boys', 'girls', 'the rich', 'the poor']",From the passage we know that_had more chances to receive education in Pakistan mountains in the past.,"If you love books, then""Three Cups of Tea""will be your favorite. It will take you on an adventure to one of the highest mountains in the world. You will learn how the people and children there lived and how the writer, Greg Mortenson , helped build an education system.
While climbing K2 in Pakistan, one of the world's most difficult mountains to climb, Greg Mortenson became ill and got lost. He got help in a small village. The people of the village took good care of him, feeding him and letting him sleep in a villager's house. They also gave him their best food: sweet tea.
When Mortenson was fine, he found that the children of the village worked and studied outdoors. Their teacher came only three times a week and they didn't have blackboards. They used sticks to write on the ground.
The day he left the village, he told them he would come back and build a school. His school would have both boys and girls. Later on, he came back and helped build a school, so the kids were able to study in the classroom with real writing instruments.
That was in 1993. Today Mortenson is going to build 80 schools in Central Asia. He started a foundation called the Central Asia Institute to raise money for these schools. He has helped more than 18,000 girls receive education so far.",middle38.txt
