1,A,"[""Adult dogs can't use their nose to find their mothers."", 'When a dog feels too hot, he will lose his sense of smell.', 'Dogs often sniff with short breaths when they feel sad.', ""A dog's tail can't show his feelings unless he is frightened.""]","Which of the following is TRUE according to the last two parts ""Nose"" and ""Tail""?","There are four main areas when it comes to your dog's body language -- his ears and face, eyes, nose and tail. If you pay attention to those things, you'll find you are able to easily understand how your dog is feeling.
Ears and face
The head of a dog is more expressive than you think. If you say a word that he recognizes, like his name or something you say often, his ears will get up. His mouth is another good instruction. A mouth that is wide open to pant   with some sound suggests that the dog is happy -- some people even say when a dog is panting, he is laughing as he cools himself. A tongue sticking out suggests that the dog is in a good mood.
Eyes
To a dog, purple and blue are both seen as shades of blue. Red is seen as black or dark grey. Orange, yellow and green are seen as various shades of yellow. This means that, to a dog, bright orange toys are the same yellow shade. If you want your dog to clearly see his toys in the green grass you'd better give the dog blue toys; if you have orange, yellow or green toys, the dog will be able to find them with his nose.
Nose
A dog can both sniff and breathe through his nose. Breathing is for air, but when dogs sniff with short breaths they are actually following some scents   with his keen   nose. When a dog is overheated, his sense of smell is reduced by as much as 40 percent and he uses the air to cool himself rather than for smelling. Puppies' noses can help find their mother when their eyes and ears are closed. The function will disappear by the time they are adults.
Tail
Lastly, you need to pay attention to your dog's tail, because it shows what he is thinking and feeling. A dog that is in a good mood will have a tail that seems to be going a mile a minute -- wagging, and excited. However, an angry or frightened dog will have his tail between his legs.",high13218.txt
