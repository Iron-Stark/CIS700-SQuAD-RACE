3,D,"['confident and outgoing', 'brave and hard-working', 'wise and easy-going', 'determined and brave']",From the passage we can say the boy is  _  .,"My son has poliomyelitis  and he suffered from it a lot. When he was young, my wife and I took him to see so many doctors and got different kinds of treatments. But still, he couldn't walk like a normal kid.
So he was laughed at by his peers for his walking style. His tears burnt our eyes like sulphuric acid . Then, he became afraid of going to school. He wouldn't go anymore.
One night, my wife had a breakdown and shouted at him, ""I tell you, my kid, you might be like this forever. You are a freak in other people's eyes, and perhaps it would never change. But in my eyes, in your dad's eyes, you are not a freak! You are not! Even if you are, we love you and we will love you forever!"" My son spoke nothing for two days. He didn't eat or sleep. We could read he was hurt. We hoped something wonderful would fall in our family. On the third morning, he struggled to walk to my car, with his school bag in his hand of course. He raised his head high and hugged me, saying ""I want to go to school. Nothing will beat me.""
You know, from then on, he was never afraid of being mocked or despised anymore. If he couldn't avoid these looks, he chose to look at them in the eyes. Later, something nice really happened and my son went to MIT. When he was asked how he managed to bear the pressure, he said, ""Because of my parents.""
My dear fellows, if you care too much about how other people look at you or what their opinions are, you will never become what you want to be.",high19372.txt
