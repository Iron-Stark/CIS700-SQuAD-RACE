0,A,"['Hardships make a country stronger.', 'Premier Wen jiabao went on his first trip around the quake disaster zone.', 'Life is difficult.', 'The Chinese are deeply moved by Premier Wen.']",What's the main idea of the passage?,"Premier Win Jiabao continued his second trip around the quake disaster zone on May 23, 2008, visiting surviving students in Mianyang, one of the worst-hit cities.
In a tent school, where more than 500 students from the destroyed prefix = st1 /BeichuanMiddle Schoolwere studying, Premier Wen encouraged them to study harder following the disaster. ""let us not forget the earthquake,"" he told the students. ""Then you will know what life is all about--it is bumpy, as the roads are.  Today, people save us and take good care of us. In the future, we will help them in return."" He wrote on the blackboard to encourage them, ""Hardships make a country stronger.""
His first trip to the area was on May 12, just hours after the powerful quake rocked Sichuanat 2:28 pm. During the next four days, Premier Wen set foot in almost all of the worst-hit counties, walking over rocks and tiles, comforting weeping children and encouraging rescuers.
The Chinese Premier says saving lives is the top priority. ""We must try all means to get into those areas. The earlier, the better. One person can be saved one second earlier. As long as there is a gleam of hope, we will make efforts 100 times greater than that.'
Chinese are deeply moved by what the Premier has said and done. A mother sent a message to her son in Beijing, saying ""The 66-year-old Premier Wen has worked really hard for quake relief. He has comforted and moved us. Pass this on to your friends, pray for him.""",high24171.txt
