1,D,"['The editor.', 'The official.', 'The reporter.', 'The professor.']","Which of the following people has a clear opinion on whether ""Super Girls"" should be edited into Cihai?","Are the Super Girls super enough to make it into China's most authoritative  dictionary? 
The editors of Cihai are working on a new edition, and they say they haven't decided yet. 
""The editing preparation of the 2009 edition of the dictionary has just started,"" an editor of Cihaisaid. ""Which new words will be added, and which old ones will be deleted, remains unknown.""
The TV programme that brought the Super Girls into the public eye has certainly had an influence on Chinese society since its  _ in 2004.
The editor said the new edition will include terms such as ""Shenzhou VI,"" the name of China's second manned spacecraft, and Ba Jin, a late master of contemporary  Chinese literature. 
The argument began earlier this week, when media reported that Cihai, as a dictionary that prides itself on its educational and historical value, would not include terms such as ""Super Girl."" 
An official said that some online words were popular, but Cihaipreferred words of both popularity and stability  and those that can withstand the test of time and usage. 
A reporter from China Economic News said: ""We all agree on the great contribution of Ba Jin, but who can look down on the social influence of the Super Girl?""
A Professor told China Daily: ""Of course 'Super Girls' should be edited intoCihai. If some strange words can be in there, why not 'Super Girls'? Even though it may die out after a few years just as, say, 'Shenzhou VI' will be replaced by 'Shenzhou IX' one day.""
Cihai records new words reflecting the latest developments in the social and natural sciences, including biology, electronics, computer science and economics.",high17380.txt
