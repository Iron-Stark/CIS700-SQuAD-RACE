I thought that Lynne would pay because she had invited me.
I arrived at the restaurant exactly on time. I'd been told that Americans expect you to be on time. Lynne and I sat at a table in the corner of the restaurant and a waitress came and took our order. The dinner was a great success. I talked a lot about Saudi Arabia and Lynne told me all about herself. After two hours the waitress finally came and asked if we wanted one check or two. Lynne said two. We went to the cashier and Lynne paid her check. I was embarrassed   when the cashier gave me my bill. I had no money to pay for my meal. Then I had an idea. I pretended to look for something in my pockets and said,""Oh!I forgot my money! Can I call my roommate,please?"" The cashier showed me where the phone was and I quickly called my roommate.
In a few minutes he arrived with some money,but he couldn't hide how he felt. He laughed all the way home.
