0,C,"['Because they can hardly find hotels.', 'Because the food is not healthy.', 'Because the cost of travel is high.', 'Because they are afraid of adventure.']",Why do most people feel hard to make their travel dream come true?,"To travel around the world is the dream of many adventurous people. But very few people can afford a global tour because hotels, food and airplane tickets are too expensive. Some people, however, have thought of some ways to realize their dreams.
Laura Cody and Tanbay Theune, a couple from Britain, decided to travel around the world. They have found a good way to pay for their trips. They look after pets for rich house owners. In exchange, they can stay in the houses for free. They have looked after horses, cows, cats, dogs and fish. In two years, the couple has been to Australia, Germany, Spain and Italy. They have stayed in big cities and small villages. The home owners are usually very generous and have given them food, wine and day trips.
Another person who tries to realize her travel dream is photographer Rhiannon Taylor. She travels around the world to visit, review and take photos of the best hotels. She shares the places she stays in and the food she eats on the Internet with tens of thousands of followers.
With these ways of making money, traveling around the world is no longer a dream. More and more young people are thinking creatively to make their dream come true.",high12985.txt
