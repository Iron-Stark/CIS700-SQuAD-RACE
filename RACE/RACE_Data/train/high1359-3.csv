3,B,"['She dropped her first book on top of a telephone booth.', 'She had no idea who took her books away', 'She always left books to her students', 'She is a bookcrosser traveling around the world']",Which of the following about Doslu is true?,"If you happen to find ""On the Road"" at a gas station or ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" in your grocery store, it might not be and accident.

The idea o leaving a book for someone else to find and enjoy is not new ---- some people have been leaving just-finished books in airports and on buses since the dawn of the hurry-up-and-wait.

Bokcrossing.com, the website that encourages books to be ""released into the wild"", has more than 18,000 members since its start last year, and averages 112 new participants daily.
Its members have scattered  more than 42,000 novels, self-help books, memoirs, technical manuals and biographies in 45 countries, leaving them in public restrooms, movie theatres, coffee studios or anywhere that they can imagine. The result: a worldwide living library.
