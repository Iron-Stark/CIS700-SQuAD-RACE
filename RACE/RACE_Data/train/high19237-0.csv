It also can take:lot of time. Some scientists are now designing silicon computer chips  that act like human organs. The scientists think they have found a way to make the process faster and more economical.
The silicon computer chips are smaller than a child's hand. Each one has living cells that act and react like a human organ. The chips are being created as part of a program to test the safety of drug compounds. It is called the Tissue Chip for Drug Screening Program.
It is a project of the US National Center for Advancing Tmnslational Sciences, or NCATS. Danilo Tagle is the center's Associate Director. He says a three-dimensional computer chip can be designed to act like a human lung.
Some computer chips contain very small models of the human digestive system. They copy the real function or duties of the human stomach and intestine , moving when breaking down food.
Drugs are added to the tiny organs for testing through instruments known as micro-tubes. Experiments with the tissue chips have produced more detailed information than tests using animal or cell models.
NCATS just announced$17 million in grants to develop an entire human organ system over the next three years.",high19237.txt
