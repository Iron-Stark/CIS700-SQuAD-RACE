3,B,"['she has to lie in bed, doing nothing', 'she wishes she were not growing up', 'she knows she has already worked the whole afternoon', ""she finds it isn't her turn to do knitting""]","Having heard her grandma's criticism ,   _  .","How hard we have all prayed  to grow up quickly, and looked forward to the happy days of being a grown-up and enjoying the many interests that a youth should have.
At last, you have grown up. At least you are no longer a child. They call you ""young lady"". You then enjoy the pleasure of being a young lady. You are proud of being a grown-up teenager. People welcome you-this young lady-heartily. You are glad that your prayer has been answered.
But there is always something that troubles you a lot. You say; ""Papa and Mama, give me some money please. My pocket money is all gone already.""
""No"", they say, ""your age is a dangerous age. If you have too much money to spend, it won't do you any good."" Then you have to stay at home because you dare not go out with an empty pocket.
Another time you tell your grandma, ""Grandma, see, I am a grown-up now.""
""Good, now, you can sit here and knit   this for me while I go and have a rest."" To show that you are no more a child, you have to sit there the whole afternoon doing the work, which only a grown-up can do. After an hour, you find it hard to do, and give the knitting basket back to your grandma. Your grandma criticizes your work. You hear what she says, ""Such a big girl can't do such easy work."" You wish then you were a child again.
But the fact is, you are growing up, and you can't help it. That's the way it goes!",high14015.txt
