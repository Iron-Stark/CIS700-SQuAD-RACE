I hope you and your family are all well. I'm e-mailing you to tell you about my new hobby, surfing.
My brother, Peter, is at home from college for the summer holiday. He is very good at surfing. We go to the beach every day and Peter teaches me to surf. I don't do well in it but it's fun. Most days we bring a picnic and stay on the beach all day. Surfing is a good exercise and an interesting way to get a suntan ! All my friends think it's a great new hobby.
Bye for now.
Love,
Rose",middle2072.txt
