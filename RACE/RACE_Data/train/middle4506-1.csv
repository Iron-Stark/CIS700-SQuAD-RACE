1,D,"[""one shouldn't criticize others very often."", 'one should look at others through his dirty windows.', 'one should often keep his windows clean.', 'one should judge himself before he judges others.']",What can we learn from the passage?,"Years ago, I lived in a building in a large city. There was another building not far from mine. A woman lived there. I had never met her, but I could see her sit by the window each afternoon, sewing or reading.
After several months, I began to notice that her window was dirty. Everything was unclear through the dirty window. I would say to myself, ""What a lazy woman! I wonder why she doesn't wash her window. It really looks terrible.""
One bright morning, I decided to clean my flat, including the windows.  When I finally finished the cleaning, I sat down by the window for a rest. What a surprise! Everything in the woman's flat could be seen clearly. Her window was clean!
I began to understand. I watched the woman's window from my own dirty window. That's the problem! That is quite an important lesson for me. How often do I look at and criticize others through the dirty window of my heart?
From then on, whenever I want to _ someone, I ask myself first, ""Am I looking at him through my dirty window?"" Then I try to clean the window of my own world so that I may see others' world more clearly.",middle4506.txt
