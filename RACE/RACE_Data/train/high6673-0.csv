0,D,"['There are too many cars in America.', 'Most cars are rarely used in America.', 'Commuting by bike is popular in America.', 'Americans try renting their cars to strangers.']",What's the main idea of the passage?,"Americans love their cars. There are more than eight cars for every 10 Americans, but most of the time, they sit idle , parked in a driveway or on the street. Now, several companies on the U. S. West Coast are helping people rent their personal car to someone else when they don't need it.
Eric Loebel is one of those people. For a small price, he wants to let his Oregon neighbors ""borrow"" his car. It's a dark blue, model year 2000 Volvo car. The sales and marketing consultant says he doesn't use it much. ""My wife and I are huge bike commuters and almost don't need a car,"" he says.
Loebel is one of the first car owners in Portland to list his wheels for rent through a so-called
""peer-to-peer car sharing"" service called Getaround. Com. ""Cars are so expensive to own,"" he says ""This can definitely offset  some of the cost."" The website lets car owners decide for themselves how much to charge borrowers to rent by the hour, day or week.
Person-to-person rentals began in Germany a decade ago, and there are a handful of similar companies in Europe and Australia. The concept caught on quickly in California over the past year according to John Atcheson, vice president of Getaround, one of four carsharing startups in the San Francisco area.
""We have had amazing cars leaping into our system,"" Atcheson says. ""Not just 1995 pickup trucks but we have had late model Mercedes, Audis, any type of car you can imagine. We actually have a Tesla Roadster--a $150,000 sports car.""
Another service called JustShareIt plans to stand out by going beyond cars. Its founder says the company will offer person-to-person rentals of power boats, jet skis and snowmobeles( ) too.",high6673.txt
