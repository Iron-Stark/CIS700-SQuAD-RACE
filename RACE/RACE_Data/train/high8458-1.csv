1,C,"['PM2.5 has long been ignored.', 'PM2.5 is an element in smog.', 'Under the scope the smog can be identified clearly.', 'In recent years there are less sandstorms in Beijing.']","According to the text, which of the following is wrong?","It has been two years since China Daily last interviewed 31-year-old Zhang Chao.The micrograph enthusiast still wears the same hair style, even the same coat.
But one thing is very different: He's become a celebrity in cyberspace almost overnight, after his pictures, which show what the smog in Beijing looks like under his microscope, spread like a virus on China's major micro-blogging site Sina Weibo, since he posted them last Friday.Now the media is always interviewing him.
Zhang's apartment is on the eighth floor, which he says is perfect for capturing the thickest levels of smog.
As a Beijing native, Zhang explains his original purpose is to _ and expose its mystery."" People have higher and higher standards for the environment,"" he says,"" When I was a child, I was annoyed by the frequent sandstorms, so I feel Beijing's air seems much better now all in all because there are hardly any sandstorms in recent years.Now, we've noticed PM2.5, which has long been neglected.""
Although he graduated as a science major from Beijing Normal University, Zhang says it is difficult for him to give an exact definition of what smog is in Beijing. Under his scope, which magnifies the sample 1,000 times, the smog is found to contain minerals, fragments of animal fur and insects, seeds and burnt dust.But many are compounds, he says, which are more difficult to identify.
Zhang realizes that he may have disappointed the public because he can't show the inner construction of PM2.5 , today's most notorious(.) element in smog. It is beyond the capacity of his microscope and camera to explore such tiny grains, "" You cannot imagine how splendid the micro world is"" ! says Zhang Chao.",high8458.txt
