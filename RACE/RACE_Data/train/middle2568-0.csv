In the morning, I help my new teacher Mr Hu put some new English textbooks into a big box. And then I carry it to the classroom. The box is very heavy.
I walk very slowly  with the big heavy box in my arms. A boy runs very fast to me. He can't stop. Oh, dear! My box drops on the floor and there are books everywhere on the floor.
""I'm very sorry,"" the boy says again and again. He helps me to pick up all the books. He then helps me to carry the books to our classroom.
Who is he? He is my classmate. His name is Jim. He comes to China with his father. He is from England.",middle2568.txt
