1,B,"['Beef', 'Carrot', 'Pork', 'Chicken']",Which is the most environment-friendly food according to the passage?,"Think about what you had for lunch: Was it a hamburger? A chicken sandwich? Barbecue? What about vegetables? Would it surprise you to learn that what you eat can affect the whole planet?
It can--in a big way. New studies show how food and its production affect the globe and its warming climate. You've probably heard of global warming : The temperature is on the rise because humankind has beenreleasing   amounts of gases into the atmosphere. One of these greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide .
What does this have to do with food ? A big part of the carbon dioxide that we put in the atmosphere every year comes from the process of making and eating food. The production of meat contributes a lot of that carbon diode. And much of meat's contribution comes from beef , which is responsible for releasing even more warming gases into the atmosphere.
The process of making a hamburger ,for example, requires a lot of energy. A cow has to be fed and raised on farmland, and cow waste is a major source ofmethane   -- an especially powerful greenhouse gas. The cow has to be killed. The meat has to beprocessed  and shipped to a shop, which takes fuel . Most of the cow won't even be used for meat that people eat. By the time a hamburger finally lands on a dinner plate, it has made a heavy effect on the environment.
We can reduce the production of global-warming gases by eating less beef .Other kinds of meat like pork and chicken do less harm to the environment--at least in terms of the amount of greenhouse gases released.
All kinds of meat are harder on the planet than vegetables. To grow and eat a pound of potatoes, for example, sends less than one-quarter pound of carbon dioxide into the air. So changing our diet to less meat and more vegetables, as it turns out, may do the world some good.",high11384.txt
