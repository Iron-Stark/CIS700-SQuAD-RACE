In the village Jack and Mike see a beautiful old church, but when they come into the church, some people are there. They don't know what the people are doing.
""Oh! Just sit quietly, and do like the others!"" Mike says. Because they don't really know French, so they stand, kneel, and sit to follow other people.
Then the priest says something. The man next to Jack and Mike stands up. ""We should stand up, too!"" Jack whispers to Mike.
So, Jack and Mike stand up with the man. Suddenly, all the people smile!
