She was really nervous.
There were already hundreds of items in the room, including umbrellas, coats, shopping bags, toys and bears. At 9:30 a.m., a worker came in with a box full of new lost property .
Katie heard a mobile phone ring and jumped. She looked over to the box. There were over 20 phones there. She found the phone that was ringing but it stopped just when she picked it up. Ten seconds later, it rang again.
              "" Hello.""
              "" Hello, who is this?"" said a man. It wasn't easy to hear him.
              "" This is Katie Daglish. I work for the Glasgow Underground Lost Property Department.""
              "" Do you have my bag?""
              "" What does it look like?""

              "" Great! My sister will come to your office in the afternoon to get it. Thanks.""
              Katie gave the address to the man. She hoped it would always be this simple.
              At 2p.m., a lady came into her office. She described the green and white bag and said her cousin had lost it.
"" I thought it was your brother,"" said Katie.
"" No, it's my cousin."" Katie thought that there couldn't be many bags like this and the man wasn't easy to hear. He probably said cousin. Katie gave the lady the bag. One hour later, another lady came in.
"" Hello. You spoke to my brother this morning. You have his Celtic bag. He's so happy because it has PS10,000 in it. He was worried because there are hundreds of Celtic bags in Glasgow.""
"" Ten thousand pounds..."" said Katie nervously. She quickly looked in the bag again. She found another Celtic bag with some clothes but nothing else.
Katie told the lady what had happened. She was very angry and called the police. Katie thought she would only have this job for one day.
A policeman came quickly. She told Katie, who didn't come from Glasgow, that, because Celtic is a popular football team in Glasgow, many people have green and white bags. Katie was just about to describe the first lady to the policeman when the first lady stepped in. she had looked in the bag and found the money. 
The second lady thanked the first lady and gave her PS500. The policeman told Katie to be more careful and keep the names of people who took lost property.
The next day, the man came to thank Katie. He told her to find out more about Glasgow. He then gave her two tickets to the next Celtic football game.",high24127.txt
