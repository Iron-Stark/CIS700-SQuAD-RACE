1,D,"['Bored.', 'Pleased.', 'Uncomfortable.', 'Surprised.']",How did the man feel as soon as the medical examination was over?,"Last year Jim was going to join the army( ) and had to take a medical examination  . The doctor was sitting at a desk when he went in. He said to the man, ""Take your coat and shirt off, and sit on that chair.""
Jim did so. The doctor looked at him for a moment without getting up from his chair and then said, ""All right. Put your clothes on again.""
""But you haven't examined me at all."" the young man said in surprise.
""There is no need to do so,"" the doctor said with a smile. ""When I told you to take your coat and shirt off, you heard me all right, so there is nothing wrong with your ears. You saw your chair, so your eyes are good. You could take your clothes off and sit on the chair, so you must be in good health.",middle8069.txt
