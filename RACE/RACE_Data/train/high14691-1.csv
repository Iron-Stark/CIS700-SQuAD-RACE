These are attacks of the personal space invaders . Though preferences for personal space differ from culture to culture, we Britons do love our independence and personal space.
As the British customs website Debrett has said, as a British person, somebody standing too close may make you ""focus less on what somebody is saying than on how close they are to you"". Simple acts like putting an arm around someone you don't know that well may seem friendly in China, but they can make us very uncomfortable. The ediplomat.com website explains: ""The British are not back slappers   or touchers and generally do not show affection   in public.""
Being a British person around people from other countries can therefore be full of problems. People from many European countries such as France and Spain kiss each other on the cheek when they meet, yet to us this seems too friendly and ""touchy-feely"".
Simple matters like how close others stand can be problems to Britons who want to keep their own personal space. Giving advice on how to behave around a British person, Debrett's says that ""if you can feel the warmth of their worried breath upon your face, then you're standing too close"".
So, are British people unfriendly? No. The ediplomat.com website explains that we are not as _ as we may seem, but ""very friendly and helpful to foreigners"". However, we do have different ideas about our own space to many people from other countries. Just let us know if you're going to come any closer than arm's length, and you'll be fine!",high14691.txt
