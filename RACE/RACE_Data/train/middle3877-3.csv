He never laughs at people when they are in trouble. Instead, he tries to help them. When people are waiting for a bus, he stands in line and takes his turn. He never pushes to the front of the line. On the bus, he offers his seat to an older person or a woman with a child in the arms. If he gets in someone's way, he says ""excuse me"". He says ""please"" when he makes a request  , and he says ""thank you"" when he receives something. He doesn't stop other people when they are talking. He does not speak with his mouth full of food when he is eating.",middle3877.txt
