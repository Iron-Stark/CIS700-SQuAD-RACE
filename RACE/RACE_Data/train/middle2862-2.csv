Welcomes You to Parents'Night!
Welcome to Parents' Night at Johnson School On Tuesday night. We will share some of our work with you.
Please spend some time looking around our classroom. Here are some of the things you will find:
A class book, the Bare Facts about Bears, that we just published. Each student wrote one page about a bear of his or her choice.
Some of the bears you will about polar bears.
Maps of the countries we are studying. Through our maps, you will learn about India, Mexico, and France. You will also know about the different countries and languages of these countries.
Models of the planets in our solar system. We used small balls and colored paper to build a model of planets and the sun.
Our classroom store. Here we buy and sell things. We learn about money and also practice math skills.",middle2862.txt
