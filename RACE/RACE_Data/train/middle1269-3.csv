3,D,"['seven', 'nine', 'ten', 'eleven']",Buffett invited Hsing to play against his friends when she was  _  .,"U.S. billionaire Bill Gates went to watch a game of his friend, U.S. teen player Ariel Hsing, at the ExCel Centre while the girl was playing against Chinese Li Xiaoxia.
Gates wore an orange jacket and dark blue baseball cap. He sat in the front row of thespectators' stand  andapplauded  for every point Hsing scored.
""I'm wishing her the best of luck, but the opposite player is really great,"" Gates said.
Hsing was in her third match at London 2012. She had already beaten Mexico's Yadira Silva and Luxembourg's Ni Xia Lian.
Hsing is known in the U.S. as a close friend with billionaires Warren Buffett and Gates. She is close enough to call them ""Uncle Warren"" and ""Uncle Bill"".
Buffett met Hsing when she was only 9. Two years later, he invited her to play against his friends. She has returned several times after that. Earlier this year after winning a position on the U.S. team, she took a few points off Buffett and Gates.
When asked whether he has won a point off Hsing, Gates said, ""She beat me when she was nine. She has been nice to me.""",middle1269.txt
