0,C,"['Travel.', 'Culture.', 'Technology.', 'Advertisement.']",In which part of a newspaper can we probably read this passage?,"A 15-year-old student who invented a flashlight getting power from the holder's body heat is going home today from California with a big prize and a chance to do further research.
Ann Makosinski was the only Canadian among the four winners at Google's international science competition. Thousands of young scientists from around the world took part in the competition.
Winning the science and technology competition was ""a surprise"". Ann said, ""I think it will have a great influence on my future.""
Ann thanked her family for encouraging her interest in science and said that her first toy was a box of transistors .
The ideas for the invention came from seeing unwanted batteries and her friend's experience. When Ann visited a friend in the Philippines, she saw the friend couldn't study when it became dark because there was no electricity or light. She saw the need for a flashlight that has no batteries - Hollow Flashlight.
In her project, Ann wrote ""I made two flashlights that do not use any batteries or harmful materials. They do not create any noise and will always work. The flashlight needs at least a 5degCtemperature difference between the holder's body and the environment around to produce light.""
A video of Ann explaining how she created the flashlight has been watched more than 1.4 million times on the Internet.
Though Ann was successful, she has not made a decision about her career path. Ann hope that she can find a way to join her love of film and science together.
The four winners were chosen from 15 final competitors from eight countries. The competition attracted thousands of students in 120 countries.",middle6476.txt
