For Killing Wolves
In Alaska,the wolf almost disappeared a few years ago,because hunters were killing hundreds of them for sport. However.1aws were established to protect the wolves from sportsmen and people who catch the animals for their fur.So the wolf population has greatly increased. Now there are so many wolves that they are destroying their own food supply.
A wolf naturally eats animals in the deer family. People in the wilderness also hunt deer for food.Many of the animals have been destroyed by the very cold winters recently and by changes in the wilderness plant life.When the deer can't find enough food,they die.
If the wolves continue to kill large numbers of deer,their prey will disappear some day.And the wolves will.too.So we must change the cycle of life in the wilderness to balance the ecology.If we killed more wolves,we would save them and their prey from dying out.We'd also  save some farm animals.
In another northern state,wolves attack cows and chickens for food.Farmers want the  government to send biologists to study the problem.They believe it necessary to kill wolves in some areas and to protect them in places where there is a small wolf population.
Against Killing Wolves
If you had lived long ago,you would have heard many different stories about the dangerous  wolf.According to most stories,hungry wolves often kill people for food.Even today,the stories of the ""big bad wolf'""will not disappear.
But the fact is wolves are afraid of people.and they seldom travel in areas where there is a human smell.When wolves eat other animals,they usually kill the very young.or the sick and injured .The strongest survive .No kind of animal would have survived through the centuries if the weak members had lived.And has always been a law of nature.
Although some people say it is good sense to kill wolves,we say it is nonsense! Researchers  have found wolves and their prey living in balance.The wolves keep the deer population from  becoming too large, and that keeps a balance in the wilderness plant life.
The real problem is that the areas where wolves can live are being used by people.Even if wilderness land is not used directly for human needs.the wolves can't always find enough food .So they travel to the nearest source, which is often a farm.Then there is danger.The ""big bad wolf"" has arrived! And everyone knows what happens next.",high6265.txt
