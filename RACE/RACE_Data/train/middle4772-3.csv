3,C,"[""the old man needed the writer's help then he came"", 'the writer was always friendly to other people', 'the old man believed everyone could be friends', 'the old man had lots of friends and no enemies']","The sentence ""I said a prayer today and you were the answer"" most probably means that  _  .","I was on the escalator in a market. There was an old man who was about five or six people in the front of me. People behind him were all in a hurry and saw him as a rock. The old man knew these clearly and tried hard to step aside.
I remember...Sometimes when walking or driving behind an older person, I've gotten impatient and upset.
""I'm sorry. Please forgive me!"" said the old man, ""I don't mean to hold you up."" He then tried his best to get off the escalator.
I suddenly saw this in a whole new light. I felt sick to my stomach. The old man was apologizing to everyone, when we should have helped him to calm his fears.
One by one, people went around him quickly. By the time I got to him, I asked, ""Sir, can I help you?""
The man thought for a while, then said, ""Well, yes, thank you!""
I placed my hand under his left arm and walked away from the rush of people quickly.
""So what are you shopping for, sir?""
""Oh, today is Mother's Day. I want to buy something for my neighbor. She's a single mother and she is always so nice to me."" he said, stopping suddenly as he searched his pocket.
""Oh, it's here! I always carry them with me,"" he said. Then he took out some business cards and handed me one which read:
""John Smith.
Friend to all...enemy to no one!
I said a prayer today and you were the answer.
Thank you!""
""That's for you,"" he said. ""Thanks for stopping to help an old man.""
""My friend, you helped me. I discovered why I was unhappy with the world. Now I know how to solve the problem. No more with me!""",middle4772.txt
