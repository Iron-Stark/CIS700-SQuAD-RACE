1,C,"['steaming some peas to feed the horses', ""amusing the King with the monkey's trick"", ""blaming the king gently using the monkey's example."", 'going back and guarding the country']",The minister persuaded the King to give up his original plan by   _  .,"The King received news one day that a group outlaws were committing some wrong and cruel acts on a distant border of the kingdom.
The news angered the King. He quickly gathered his army and started off for the distant border, leaving his kingdom unguarded and without a ruler.
On their long march, the King and his army made camp for the night wherever they could. One rainy day they stopped in a forest, seeking shelter under the trees. They unsaddled  their horses and steamed some peas, which they fed to their steeds in long narrow containers.
A monkey in a tree nearby saw the horses being fed, and he came racing down, filled both paws with peas, then climbed quickly up to a branch and settled down to eat. But as he opened one paw, a single pea fell to the ground. Without hesitation, the monkey jumped from his branch to hunt for the lost pea, and in doing so,he dropped all the other peas in his paws.
The King observed this foolish monkey and was greatly amused. He timed to his minister and asked: ""Friend, what do you think of this monkey who would give up so much to _ so little?""
""That is the way of the foolish,"" replied the minister, ""they will give up much that is certain for a little that is uncertain.""
Then he added, ""And we, Great King, are we not like the monkey in the trees. To gain so little we neglect so much exactly like the monkey with its pea.""
The King understood the blame and realized how very foolish he had been himself to leave his kingdom unguarded. He gave out orders to his men, and he and his army returned at once to their country.",high9823.txt
