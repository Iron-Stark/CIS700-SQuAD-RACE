0,C,"['To recall the experiences in high school.', 'To warn high school students about love in high school.', 'To give advice to high school students.', 'To encourage high school students to focus on study.']",What is the purpose of the passage?,"If I had known the following things when I was in high school, my life would have been 100% easier back then and probably would have helped me greatly. I realized some of these things I was told but being young and ignorant I refused to listen.
1.Your high school sweetheart will probably not be your spouse.
When I was in school, I thought my boyfriend and I were the ""one and only true love"". Honestly as most young people do, statistically only like 2% of people end up marrying their high school sweethearts and even if they do they probably won't be as happy as they were in high school. Being an adult is very stressful and your relationships become different.
2.  _ 
How many kids play sports per year? How many kids are good enough to get a scholarship by playing sports? How many of them even make it to the Olympics after college or university? The kids who actually stay at home and focus on getting good at computers or math are the ones who make the most in the adult world financially.
3. It doesn't matter what university you go to.
I was convinced I was going to go to a great art school when I graduated and I was so stressed out about it that I ended up dropping out of school. In reality my life wasn't over; I only got my GED a year ago but I am in a decent school now. In the real world when you go to apply somewhere all they care about is ""do you have a degree or a certification""?
4. Your friends probably won't be your friends after you graduate.
I really thought I was going to get an apartment with my friends and our kids were going to grow up together. The truth is, when people grow up they move, have kids, get married, and therefore change. You will change; you will not be the same person you were. High school is just a transitional period of your life. So don't worry about who is saying what about you or who is making fun of whom.",high8034.txt
