0,B,"[""can't take the national entrance exam to college"", 'can find less study material than normal students', 'can never learn a foreign language well', ""can't afford the English textbooks for an entrance exam""]",It can be learned from the passage that the blind students in China  _  .,"One determined student stepped off the traditional job for blind people in China, and now challenges a new life at university in Britain. Being a message therapist  is a perfect job for many people with a visual disability, but for Zheng Jianwei, it was far from enough.
The 30-year-old former massage therapist gave up his hospital job in 2009to prepare for admission to graduate school. He took IELTS , the language-fluency test necessary for university admission in the UK, in 2012 and scored 6.5 points. He was the first blind examinee to take the IELTS in the Southeast Chinese region. After about four year's struggles, Zheng successfully gain an offer from the University of Essex in the United Kingdom and became a graduate student.
However,Zheng's path to graduate school was not easy. ""I can't take China's national entrance exam for graduate school, which doesn't provide study material for blind students,"" he says.
He then turned to search for graduate school overseas. However, English became his nightmare. Zheng studied in special schools for visually challenged students since primary school, but foreign language was never a main subject.
Before giving up his job and learning English again in 2009, Zheng only knew the alphabet, a few words and some basic expressions. ""Learning English again in my late 20s is not easy,"" he says.
It took him three years of intensive study to gain entrance to a graduate school overseas. Because of the lack of study material, Zheng needs to spend hours and days looking for textbooks for the visually disabled and copying them, while it may take only five minutes for a sighted person to order a plain English textbook from Amazon.
In his parents' eyes, Zheng has been a sensible, independent and decisive man from a young age. Zheng made all the major decisions by himself, including studying abroad and choosing majors. ""We just follow his decisions, "" the mother says.",high5650.txt
