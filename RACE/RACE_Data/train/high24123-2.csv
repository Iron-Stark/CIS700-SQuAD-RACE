2,A,"['Because trees can protect the environment.', 'Because trees are living plants.', 'Because she considered it a danger to cut down trees.', 'Because the man might fall down on the ground.']",Why did Annabelle prevent the man from cutting down the tree?,"Annabelle Smith and her two best friends, Samantha and Kristy, loved going to Sand City School. Mrs. Lemming, their teacher, would read them a story. That Monday afternoon, Mrs. Lemming read them a story called Super Sophie Saves the Day. 
After school, Annabelle, Samantha and Kristy walked home together. ""I decide that from now on I'm going to be a superhero like Sophie,"" Annabelle told her friends.
""You mean heroine,"" Kristy said. ""You're a girl, Annabelle.""
The next day Kristy and Samantha picked Annabelle up on their way to school. Annabelle had a red towel taped to her blue shirt. ""I am Super Annabelle,"" Annabelle said. ""I'll save someone on the way to school.""
Charlotte, another second-grader, walked past the girls. Her sweater was tied around her waist. She ran a little faster, and her sweater was nearly on the ground. Annabelle wondered what she would do. Giving her a dirty look, Charlotte ran away. 
Annabelle walked into her father's study when she got home. She had a homework question for him. A note on her father's desk said he was lending some books to Charlotte's father. She noticed a magazine on his desk that said Go Green. ""Homework can wait,"" Annabelle thought. ""Maybe Charlotte goes green!""   
In the woods, Annabelle saw a man cutting down a tree. Trees were good for the environment. She prevented him from cutting down the tree, and then she fell on the hard ground. Annabelle walked farther in the woods, where she found Charlotte picking up litter.
Annabelle said, ""You are the second-grade's hero, Charlotte.""
Charlotte stared at Annabelle. ""I'm picking up litter to make the earth a better place,"" she said. ""I don't care about being famous.""
Annabelle felt slightly ashamed of herself.",high24123.txt
