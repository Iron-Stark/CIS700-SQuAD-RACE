His father has a factory. One night the man drank too much and drove his car home. On his way he drove fast and suddenly his car fell into the river and he died in the accident. The old man left his son much money and the factory. But the man spent all the money in nearly three years and at last he had to sell the factory for food and clothes. Another three years passed and he wanted to find work but he couldn't do anything. Nobody would use a man like him.
The young man thought and thought. At last he found a way. He began to beg  from door to door. Most people in the town knew him well and few of them had a pity  on him. So he was often hungry. He had to leave the town and came to Toronto. In the city he began to pretend  that he couldn't speak. So he could beg some money and food.
One day Henry was begging by the station when he met Mr. Cook, one of his father's friends. The man asked, ""How long have you been dumb , Henry?""
