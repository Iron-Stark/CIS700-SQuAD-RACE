0,B,"['saw a ghost last night', 'possibly had a dream last night', 'met a UFO last night', 'was telling them something serious']",Ken suggested that Jack   _  .,"Jack had an unusual experience last night. He is sharing it with his friends. Ken and May.
Ken: What were you doing, Jack? What did you see?
Jack: It was half past nine last night and I was getting ready for bed. I heard some strange noise outside while I was brushing my teeth. I wondered what was happening and I went to the window and looked out. To my surprise, I saw a bright yellow green light in the sky.
May: Maybe the light you saw was a UFO! Or a ghost! A few years ago, an American man saw a flying saucer  while he was driving along a road. He also saw some strange yellow light. You have heard about it, haven't you?
Ken: Don't be imaginative, May. Jack didn't see anything, or anybody. It wasn't a ghost. It was probably a plane, or a shooting star. Perhaps Jack just made a horrible dream!
Jack: I am very serious. I did see something. The light disappeared and then suddenly some ""tiny people"" were standing in the garden. There were four of them. Two of them ate some flowers in the garden.
Ken: Oh, come on, Jack. I really doubt what you have said.
Jack: I am not joking! One of the people was looking at me through the window.
May: Really? What did it look like? Were you frightened?
Jack: Its whole body was green. It had no ears and nose. Its hands were huge. Its eyes were very big and looked like eggs. It looked at me and I could hardly move.
Ken: What happened then?
Jack: I was able to move _ . I ran and got my camera at once.
May: And?
Jack: I didn't have a film.
May: Oh no!",middle7530.txt
