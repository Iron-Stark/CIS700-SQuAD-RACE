0,D,"['Text an apology to the caller.', 'Give a reason for the delay.', 'Wait till the caller calls again.', 'Return the call as soon as possible.']",What should one do if he or she has missed a call?,"Mobile Phone Manners
Mobile phones have changed the way we communicate;they have also brought about     problems in phone manners.Gaik Lira, a Singapore-based advice has some advice on     phone manners.
When dealing with missed calls,the person being.called should return the call.""Calls     should be returned as soon as possible, and no later than the following day. Anything later     than that,and an apology or a reason for the delay should go with the call.""
Text messages should be kept short and to the point.If they go beyond four or five     lines,call or e-mail instead.""The use of short forms should be among family members and    friends,never in a business situation.""
    Speak in a low voice as if you were talking to someone next to you.If the connection is     bad,don't raise your voice in order to be heard,simply move to another place where the     connection may be better.And if that doesn't work,tell the caller to call you back or offer     to call at a later time.
    When a conversation is cut off due to a bad connection,the person who started the     conversation should call back.""It may be inconvenient for the other person to return the     call,especially if it's an unlisted number,or an overseas call.""
    When running late for a date or meeting,it is acceptable to text to inform that you'll     be delayed.Messages should be apologetic.""A message like'Sorry.Will be about 30 mi-    nutes late due to flight delay'is considered polite and thoughtful.""
    Taking calls during meetings is only acceptable if you have informed the chairperson     that you are expecting an urgent call.If you get an unexpected but urgent call,apologize to     those present and offer a quick explanation as to why you have to take that call.Then leave     the room to contioue your phone conversation.",high17636.txt
