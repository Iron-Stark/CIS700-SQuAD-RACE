1,D,"['it was really important to learn English well', 'English he learnt in China was helpful to him', 'American students were more hard-working than Chinese students', 'textbook English was different from everyday English']",Wang Jun found that   _   when he came to Hotchkiss School in the USA.,"Hi, my name is Wang Jun. Do you want to know about my staying in America? Well, to tell you the truth, it is really an eye-opening experience here.
In China, I had English classes five times a week since Grade Five. But I didn't know textbook English could be so different from everyday English until I came to Hotchkiss School, Connecticut. When I first studied English, I was told to say ""I'm fine."" when people say ""How are you?"" But in the USA, I found that people say ""I'm good."" or ""I'm tired.""
One day, someone greeted   me with ""What's up?"" It made me _ I thought for a moment and then smiled because I didn't know what to say.
Since then, I have learnt more and more differences between Chinese and American cultures. To my surprise, American girls spend a lot of time in the burning sun getting a tan  . In China, girls try every possible way to keep their skin white.
American students are hard-working like Chinese students. In China, schoolwork is almost everything, so we study hard and that's it. But here, a ""good"" student not only gets good grades, but also does a lot for the public. That is to say, they get lots of knowledge at school and learn many life skills from social   work.",middle1573.txt
