2. Write a letter on one square. For example, write ""i.""
3. Next, take another two squares. Make a two-letter word which contains the letter you have written, for example, ""in"" or ""hi."" Put the new word (written on the two squares) below the first square.
4. Then make a three-letter word which contains the two letters you have written.Again, put the new word on the next line.
5. Keep making new words in the same way to build a ""word house."" The person who builds the highest word house in twenty minutes wins the game.",high2580.txt
