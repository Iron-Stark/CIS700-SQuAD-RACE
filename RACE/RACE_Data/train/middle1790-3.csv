One day my mother was cooking and I was playing with my younger brother Tony. Suddenly I ran to my mother and said: ""Tony fell from the open window!"" She was very worried and ran out of the kitchen. Then I said: ""Don't worry, I'm just joking."" My mother shouted at me, ""If you do it again, I'll hit you.""
Another day I went swimming with my friends in the sea. I wanted to play a joke on them. In the beginning I swam fast and I called out ""Help!"". All my friends came to help me. However, they found that I was joking. But half an hour later I wasn't joking. I was so fast, soon I got tired and couldn't swim on in water.
