3,B,"['Many students like Anna very much.', ""The writer's father knows Anna is a deaf girl."", 'Anna has everything she wants.', 'Anna is very happy though she is deaf.']",Which of the following is TRUE according to the text?,"I think it's hard for a teenager to live in the modern society. For example, how to go to school is a problem I often worry about. Every afternoon, my father picks me up at the gate of the school. Many parents pick up their children, too.  Most of them drive private cars. Of all the cars, Anna's father's car is the best. Anna seems to have a very rich father. She always has beautiful dresses, shoes and bags. Besides these, she is also very beautiful. But she has no friends in school. When other students are playing, she never joins them. I don't like her because she is too perfect. It makes me uncomfortable to make friends with her. She seems to have everything.
One afternoon, when I went to my father's car, I saw a small thing fall out of Anna's bag.  So I called her quickly. However, she didn't look back and kept going. I felt very angry with her.
During the dinner, my father asked me, ""Why do you look unhappy?""
""Today I saw something fall out of Anna's bag, so called her.  But she didn't answer me. She is _ . "" said angrily.
""Oh, I know that girl. She has no friends and is unhappy because she was born deaf. I'm sure that she didn't hear you. ""
What my father said suddenly woke me up. Because she is deaf, she does not talk or play with anyone at school.  She seems to have everything, but in fact she doesn't.
Not everyone is perfect, even the perfect man has his weakness.",middle7893.txt
