2,C,"['to meet his future wife', 'to marry an American', 'to spend his holiday', 'to learn American English']",We know from the passage that the writer went to America   _  .,"Like most English children,I learned foreign languages at school.When I made my first visit to the United States,I was sure I could have a nice easy holiday without any language problem.But how wrong I was. 
At the American airport,I was looking for a public telephone to tell my friend Jenny that I had arrived.A worker asked if he could help me.""Yes,""I said,""I want to give my friend a ring.""""Well,that's nice.Are you getting married?""he asked.""No,""I replied.""I just want to tell her on the phone I have arrived.""""Oh,""he said.""There is a phone downstairs on the first floor.""""But we're on the first floor now,""I said.""Well,I don't know what you are talking about.Maybe you aren't feeling too well after your journey,""he said.""You just go and wash up,and you will feel a lot better.""And he went off,leaving me wondering where on earth I was:at home we wash up after a meal to get the cups and plates clean.How can I wash up at an airport 
At last we did meet.She explained the misunderstanding:Americans say ""to give someone a call"",but we English say""to give somebody a ring"".When we say""to wash your hands"",they say""to wash up"".And Englishmen start numbering from the ground floor,so the first floor is the second for Americans.",high19479.txt
