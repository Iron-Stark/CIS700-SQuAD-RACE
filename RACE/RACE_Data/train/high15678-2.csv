2,D,"['Kind, brave and generous.', 'Kind, shy and merciful.', 'Kind, innocent and passive.', 'Kind, brave and honest.']",What kind of person could the farmer Fleming probably be?,"His name was Fleming, and he was a poor Scottish farmer. One day, while trying to eke  out a living for his family, he heard a cry for help coming from a nearby bog  . He dropped his tools and ran to the bog. There, mired to his waist in black muck  was a terrified boy, screaming and struggling to free himself. Farmer Fleming saved the lad from what could have been a slow and terrifying death.
The next day, a fancy carriage pulled up to the Scotsman's sparse  surroundings. An elegantly dressed nobleman stepped out and introduced himself as the father of the boy Farmer Fleming had saved.
""I want to repay you,"" said the nobleman. ""You saved my son's life.""
""No, "" the Scottish farmer replied, waving off the offer. At that moment, the farmer's own son came to the door of the family hovel .
""Is that your son?"" the nobleman asked. ""Yes,"" the farmer replied proudly.
""I'll make you a deal. Let me take him and give him a good education. If the lad is anything like his father, he'll grow to a man you can be proud of.""
And that he did. In time, Farmer Fleming's son graduated from St. Mary's Hospital Medical School in London, and went on to become known throughout the world as the noted Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of Penicillin.
