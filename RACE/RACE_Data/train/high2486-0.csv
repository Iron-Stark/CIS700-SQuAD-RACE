At the conference in San Francisco, Donald Louria, a professor at New Jersey Medical School in Newark said progress in using genes as well as nanotechnology makes it likely that humans will live in the future beyond what has been possible in the past. "" There is a great push so that people can live from 120 to 180 years,"" he said. "" Some have suggested that there is no limit and that people could live to 200 or 300 or 500 years.""
