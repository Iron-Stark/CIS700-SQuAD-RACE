1,C,"['you should talk as much as possible', 'there is no need for you to treat it seriously', 'you should try to master  the first few seconds', 'you should wear strange clothes to give him or her a deep impression']","According to the text, when you want to make friends with someone,   _  .","A good first impression is important. So, how do you, when you're meeting someone for the first time, make certain he or she doesn't get the wrong image of you?
A study concluded that the first 30 seconds make or break the connection between two people when they meet for the first time. Another study conducted by UCLA found that ""people evaluate one another by using the three V's: visual (appearance), vocal (voice) and verbal (what you say).""
Before you head out on your next date to meet someone new, let's concentrate on these areas:
*How others will see you. (Visual) Are you dressed well? Do you look like this date is important to you? Did you take some time with your appearance? Watch your manners: people don't like bad manners.
*How others will hear you. (Vocal) Is your voice too soft? You might come across as insecure. If you speak softly, make an effort to speak clearly -- don't make your date have to work to hear you.
*What others will hear you say. (Verbal) People have a natural desire to connect -- let them know you're interested in what they have to say by repeating it back to them. Don't say the same thing everyone else is saying.",high7054.txt
