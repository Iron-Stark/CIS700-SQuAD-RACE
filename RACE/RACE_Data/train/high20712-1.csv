1,A,"['when she went out to dinner with her husband four months after the shoes were repaired', 'when she put one of them on her left foot', 'when she took the shoes off for a closer look', 'when she put one of them on her wrong foot']",The writer noticed something wrong with the repaired shoes   _  .,"After moving to a small town, I took several pairs of shoes to the shoemaker to be fixed. Within a week I picked them up and put them away in my closet.
Four months later my husband and I were invited out to dinner. I unboxed a pair of high heels . I hadn't worn them since they were repaired. I put one shoe on my right foot, and then I put the other on my left. I took both shoes off for a closer look. They were exactly the same style, color1 and size, but each was for the right foot.
I was puzzled, since I had worn the shoes on several occasions and knew I hadn't worn two right shoes. Then I thought of the shoemaker. Although I was sure he wouldn't remember me after such a long time, I telephoned him and explained to him the trouble I had.
""Thank goodness you finally called!"" he was nearly shouting, ""An angry woman with two left shoes has been bothering for months!""",high20712.txt
