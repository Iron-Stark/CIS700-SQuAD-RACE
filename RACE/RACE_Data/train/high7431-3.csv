3,A,"[""It seemed that it was impossible to recover Isabelle's face using face transplant"", 'After operation Isabelle thought she looked beautiful and rebuilt her life again', ""Some doctors had no better idea to repair the damage to Isabelle's face"", 'It was Dr Bernard Devauchelle who came up with the idea of face transplant']","According to the passage, which of the following is NOT true?","Can you imagine being savagely attacked by a dog? What if the attack was so severe that your nose, lips and chin were completely destroyed? How would you feel about yourself? Would you be able to look at yourself in the mirror? And how do you think other people would treat you?
Isabelle Dinoire is someone who can answer all of these questions honestly and openly.
Last November Isabelle was attacked and mauled by her own dog. The attack was so severe that her lower face was damaged; it seemed, almost beyond repair. She was rushed to hospital and became the first person ever to have a face transplant.
With such severe injuries doctors offered Isabelle little hope that they would be able to repair the damage to her face using conventional surgery.
Shortly after being admitted, she came to the attention of Dr Bernard Devauchelle who, unlike other surgeons, believed there was an alternative: ""We found ourselves saying, yes, it's clear this woman needs a transplant,"" he said.
Two days after the operation she saw her face in the mirror for the first time. She said ""I was scared to look at myself, but when I did it was already marvelous and I couldn't believe it. I thought it would be blue and swollen but it was already beautiful.""
Now, less than a year after her 15 hour operation, she's trying to rebuild her life and there is no doubt how she feels about her new face: ""I have been saved. Lots of people write saying that I need to go on, that it's wonderful. It's a miracle somehow.""
Although there were ethical questions raised about their decision to carry out the procedure, the doctors who operated on Isabelle are quick to defend their decision.
One of them said ""Was it possible for her to live without a face? It's easy to say we shouldn't have done the operation, but her life has changed, she goes shopping, goes on holiday, she lives again.""",high7431.txt
