2,C,"['American Volleyball Team will beat any team.', 'Chinese Volleyball Team is the same as other teams.', 'She just tried to stay professional.', 'The results of each match will be the same.']","What does Lang Ping mean by saying ""It doesn't matter if we play China or any other team.""?","A couple of years ago, before a trip to China, Nicole Davis and her US women's volleyball teammates were warned about the prominence (, ) of coach ""Jenny"" Lang Ping in her native country.
""I was pushed over by Chinese journalists while I was just trying to put my luggage on the bus,"" said Davis.
Known as the ""Iron Hammer"" for her punishing spikes , Lang made it possible for China to dominate in the sport in the early 1980s. She was a key player on China's 1984 Olympic gold medal winning team.
When the US team arrived for the Olympics, Lang, 48, who is from Beijing, had to take a different route to avoid a crowd of reporters and fans.
Then came the greatest moment to Lang:while the US team was playing in a packed gym, at least 8,000 Chinese fans _ an American flag.
""That really says it all,"" Davis said. ""They look at her as an icon .I'm sure it's hard for them to see her coaching another country, but they love her so deeply that her success is their success.""
The loyalty of the Chinese fans was tested on Friday, when China lost a match to the US.
""It's a pity that China lost the match, but I'm still glad that Lang Ping's team won, since she is the pride of China's volleyball,"" said Liu Chengli, a spectator. ""We also cheered for Lang's victory.""
Lang said she just tried to stay professional when the two teams meet. ""It doesn't matter if we play China or any other team. It's the same."" Lang said.
Davis said she and her teammates could not have imagined the passion for volleyball among Chinese because the sport was lack of popularity in the US. The reception from Chinese fans has touched the US players, said a US volleyball player Lindsey Berg.
""It's such an honor to be here and play for our coach here in China,"" she said. ""The amount of support that the Chinese give to her and us has been tremendous. The whole event has been unbelievable.""",high3594.txt
