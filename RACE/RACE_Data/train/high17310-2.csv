2,A,"['It was led by James Flynn', 'Its results have been published', 'Its results represent the whole world', 'It was started one hundred years ago']",What do we know about the research mentioned in the text?,"It is a finding which is certain to be hotly discussed. According to the latest research, women are brighter than men. For the first time in IQ testing, psychologists have found that female scores have risen above those of men.
Since IQ testing began a century ago, women have been as much as five points behind. But that gap has been narrowing in recent years and this year women have moved ahead, according to James Flynn, leader of the research.
""In the last 100 years the IQ scores of both men and women have risen but women's have risen faster,"" said Mr. Flynn. ""This is a result of modernity, which is making our brains adapt   and raising our IQ.""
One possible explanation is that women's lives have become more demanding as they multitask   between raising a family and doing a job. Another is that women have a slightly higher potential intelligence than men and are only now realizing it.
Mr. Flynn, who will publish his findings in a book, said more data was needed to explain the trend. ""The full effect of modernity on women is only just starting,"" he added.
He compared IQ result from countries in western Europe and from the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Argentina and Estonia. These showed that in westernized countries the gap in scores between men and women had become minimal  .
The data for making comparison was limited and could be carried out for only a few countries. It included Australia, where male and female IQs were found to be almost the same. In New Zealand, Estonia and Argentina, women scored slightly more than men.
Mr. Flynn said, ""As the world gets more complex, people are adapting."" He added, ""I suspect that the same trends are happening in Britain, although the data is too limited to be true.""",high17310.txt
