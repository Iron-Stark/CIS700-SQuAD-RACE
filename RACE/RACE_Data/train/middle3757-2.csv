Dear Alice,
Thank you for your letter and telling me about your best friend. In this letter, I'm going to tell you about my friend. Her name is Cathy. She has long brown hair and blue eyes. She is the same age as me, but a little taller .She is always happy. We sit together in class and help each other with our homework. We always play together after school and play computer games for an hour. Cathy thinks quickly  and does better than me. She is learning to play the piano .I am learning to play the piano, too. We play together every day. It's fun. We always have a good time.
Please write to me soon.
Love,
Lily",middle3757.txt
