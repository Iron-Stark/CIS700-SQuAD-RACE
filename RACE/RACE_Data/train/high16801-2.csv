   Once an old man was walking in a street with his horse. It was raining hard. The old man was cold because he was walking in the rain. He wanted to stay in a restaurant. It was a quarter past three in the afternoon. The old man got to a small restaurant. There were a lot of people in it. The old man couldn' t come near the fire. He thought and thought. At last he said to the waiters, ""Take some fish to my horse."" The waiter and the people were very surprised. The waiter said, ""A horse doesn't eat fish."" The old man told the waiter, ""This horse is very interesting. It can sing, dance and does all kinds of things. 
It can eat fish, too,"" So the waiter brought the horse some fish. All the people in the restaurant ran out to see the horse eat fish except the old man. Now the old man sat beside the fire. After a while the waiter came back and said. ""Your horse didn't eat any fish."" The old man said, ""All right, take the fish back and put it on the table. I'll eat it.""
