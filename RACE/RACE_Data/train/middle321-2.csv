2,C,"['He drew a picture of a mushroom on the table.', 'He said ""mushrooms"" in Italian.', 'He showed the waiter a picture of a mushroom.', 'He drew a picture of an umbrella.']",How did the Englishman tell the waiter that he wanted some mushrooms?,"An Englishman was once traveling in Italy. One day he went into a small restaurant to order dinner. He understood very little Italian and couldn't read the menu . He knew the word for eggs, and so he ordered eggs. Italy is famous, however, for its mushrooms  with eggs. But he did not know the word for mushrooms. The waiter did not speak a word of English and could not help him. At last, the man took out his pocket a pencil and a piece of paper and very carefully drew a picture of a mushroom on the piece of paper. The waiter looked at the picture of the mushroom for a long while. He did not understand very well, but at last he left. He was gone a long time. After about a half hour he returned. But instead of an order of mushroom, he brought the man a large black umbrella.",middle321.txt
