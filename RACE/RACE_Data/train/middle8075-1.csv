Paul: I plan to climb   a hill. Would you like to go with me?
Peter: Thank you. But I don't want to be tired. I want to sleep at home. Have a good time!
Paul: I'm sure I will. But now I don't know what to wear.
Peter: What about your new trousers?
Paul:My new trousers are made of wool. I don't think they can make me comfortable.
Peter: You're right. Wool clothes are not fit for a trip. How about your blue jeans? What are they made of?
Paul: Cotton. They are good for trips. And shall I wear my leather shoes?
Peter: No. They will make your feet hot. You know, it is hot these days. And they are also too heavy for a trip. Try your trainers.
Paul: OK. And trainers go well with my jeans.
Peter: And why not wear your cap? It looks cool on you.
Paul: Thank you. I will wear it.",middle8075.txt
