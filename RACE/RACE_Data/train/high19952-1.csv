""I feel happy about my new hands, and I don't feel different. I like that now I can throw a football further than when I didn't have hands,"" he said.
The nation's youngest hand-transplant patient has been working hard to learn how to use his new hands. He lost his hands and his feet 7 years ago after suffering a serious infection. In August, the boy showed off his new abilities by throwing out the first ball at a baseball game. Dr. Scott Levin, team leader of Zion's operation, said Zion coped with the operation better than many adults. ""I've never seen Zion cry,"" Levin said. ""He's just an amazing boy.

It's his dream, and it's mine, too. I' m just living through him, and I'm just here to support him in any way and help him do whatever he wants to do.""

""My next goal: convince Mom to let me play football,"" he said.",high19952.txt
