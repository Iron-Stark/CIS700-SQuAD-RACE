Alice had thought her daughter was coming to visit her on Christmas day and that they were going to have the whole family together like the old days. When she finally realized that that happy moment was not going to happen,she was very sad.Knowing that her daughter was coming after Christmas was not enough to make her feel happy,I hated the idea of her being alone on the holiday!
On Christmas Eve,I gave her a surprise by asking if she could like to go to a candlelight service at church that night
Instead of taking her to my church,I took her to her old neighborhood church where all her friends were. We got there early and I got her a seat where her friends could see her as they came in.Then soon some of her friends came to the church and they rushed over to greet her and sit with her.
The candlelight service was beautiful and Alice got a lot of love from her old and new friends there.
