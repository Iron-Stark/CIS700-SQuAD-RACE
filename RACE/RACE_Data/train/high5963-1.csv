1,D,"['Learning Kit', 'Campus Trends', 'Entertainment', 'Technology']",Which section is the article most likely to be found in the newspaper?,"What's going to happen in the future? Will robots take over our planet? Will computers become smarter than us? Not likely. But here are some things that scientists say are most likely to happen 10 to 30 years later from now, according to the BBC.
1.Digital money
We used to pay with cash for everything we bought. Now when we swipe  our bus pass or use a credit card to shop online, money is spent without us even seeing it. In fact, we are already using one type of digital money.
You have to admit that using a card is much easier than searching your pockets for change. It is also safer than carrying a lot of cash.
When ATM cards were first introduced, they were not accepted everywhere. But now it's hard to live without them. People in Sweden completely stopped using cash last year, according to the Associated Press, and the US might be next.
2.Bionic eye
It's no longer something only in a scifi movie. People who are blind may have a chance to get their sight back--by wearing bionic eyes.
A blind eye can no longer sense light, but a bionic eye can use a camera to ""see"" the environment and send data directly to the brain.
Although the bionic eye that's out now only allows patients to see lights and unclear shapes, a highresolution  version could be just a few years away.
3.Selfdriving cars
Everything is going automatic these days--washing machines, ticket selling machines and even cars. Unlike a human driver, a selfdriving car won't get _ by a phone call, the radio or something outside the window. Sensors and cameras on the car would allow it to stick strictly to the rules of the road and keep a safe distance from other cars. This would greatly reduce the number of road accidents. You could even take a nap while the car drives itself.
Many vehicle companies are now planning selfdriving cars. ""By 2040, driverless vehicles will be widely accepted and possibly be the dominant vehicles on the road,"" said Jeffrey Miller, professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage, US, in Wired magazine.",high5963.txt
