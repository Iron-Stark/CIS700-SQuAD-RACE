2,B,"['The Greatest Saleswoman in the World.', 'A Successful Girl in Selling.', 'The Secret of Selling.', 'Girl Scout Cookies.']",Which of the following is the best title for the passage?,"The greatest saleswoman in the world today doesn't mind if you call her a girl. That's because Markita Andrews has got more than eight thousand dollars selling Girl Scout cookies since she was seven years old.
Going door-to-door after school, the terribly shy Markita changed herself into the cookie-selling dynamo .
It starts with great wish.
For Markita and her mother, whose husband left them when Markita was eight years old, their dream was to travel the world. ""I'll work hard to make enough money to send you to college,"" her mother said one day. ""When you leave college, you'll make enough money to take you and me around the world. Okay?""
So at the age of 13 when Markita read in her Girl Scout magazine that the Scout who sold the most cookies would win a free trip for two around the world, she decided to sell all the Girl Scout cookies she could--more Girl Scout cookies than anyone in the world, ever.
Wish, however, alone is not enough. To make her dream come true, Markita knew she needed a plan.
""When you are doing business, wear your Girl Scout clothes when you go up to people in their building, "" her aunt told her. ""Always smile, whether they buy something or not and always be nice.""
Lots of other Scouts may have wanted that trip around the world, but only Markita went off in her own uniform each day after school, ready to ask--and keep asking--people to help in her dream.
Markita sold 3,526 boxes of Girl Scout cookies that year and won her trip around the world. Since then, she has sold more than 42,000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies.
Markita is no cleverer than thousands of other people, with dreams of their own. The difference is that many people fail before they even begin. They fear that they will be refused. This fear leads many of us to refuse ourselves and prevents us from getting where we have set off for long before anyone else ever has the chance--no matter what we are selling.
""It takes courage to ask for what you want,"" she said. ""Courage is not that you don't have fear. It means doing what it takes although you have a fear of it"".",middle1362.txt
