The road was strange to him, so he traveled very slowly. When the night fell, he stopped at a nice roadside inn for accommodation .The innkeeper welcomed him.
A fine supper was prepared. The innkeeper talked about the weather, the roads, the crops. However, his guest ate silently.

Mr. Randolph looked at him and answered, ""I've paid you my bill. Should I pay you anything more? I travel the way I wish to go.""
