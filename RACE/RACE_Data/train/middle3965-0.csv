0,B,"['share', 'fight', 'play', 'talk']",Clichy and Lucy have a habit that they must find a place to   _   with each other.,"As I stood outside with my two dogs yesterday , it was so cold that my nose and face felt frozen ( ).
Of course, that doesn't matter to Ricky and Lucy. They have a habit that they must find a place to fight with each other no matter how cold or hot it is.
As cold as it was, I was excited thinking about how wonderful this special cold really was.
Then the sun broke through the clouds and memories of summer's really hot days came through my mind. I could remember standing in heat of the afternoon, with sweat pouring down my head and the hot, burning sun against my face.  I told myself then and there that in the cold of the winter I would wish I had this heat. Because of the special cold, I enjoy the heat more.
So I realized that without the extremes in my life, I would never _ the days
When things just right. without the extremes, life would be boring. For example, heath problems remind us that we need to pay more attention to how we live.
Now, I want to start finding a reason to be happy, even if it's simply the fact that I'm still alive in the world.
