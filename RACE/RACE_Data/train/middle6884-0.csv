0,D,"['They want to see the priest.', 'There are many friends.', 'They want to see the baby.', 'The church is an old building.']",Why are Jack and Mike in the church?,"Jack and Mike are on holiday in France. Mike loves visiting old buildings. Jack likes, too.
In the village Jack and Mike see a beautiful old church, but when they come into the church, some people are there. They don't know what the people are doing.
""Oh! Just sit quietly, and do like the others!"" Mike says. Because they don't really know French, so they stand, kneel, and sit to follow other people.
Then the priest says something. The man next to Jack and Mike stands up. ""We should stand up, too!"" Jack whispers to Mike.
So, Jack and Mike stand up with the man. Suddenly, all the people smile!
After that, Jack and Mike walk to the priest. ""What's so funny?"" Jack asks in English.
With a smile on his face the priest says, ""Boys, there is a new baby born, we ask the father to stand up.""
Mike smiles and says, ""We should understand what people do before we do like them. """,middle6884.txt
