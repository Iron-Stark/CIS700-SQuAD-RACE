1,A,"['were all eager for the reunion', 'were doubtful about his real purpose', 'refused to listen to him', 'all began to miss him']","When the classmates received the message from Tom, they   _  .","Their reunion was unlike any other.  Graduating from the Macon, Georgia,  class of 1959 gathered together in 2009, even though many of them never had an opportunity to meet during their high school days.
    Schools in the 1950's, like most other public locations, were segregated  in Georgia. Kids were forced to attend different schools depending on the color1 of their skin, and those with white skin were further separated by gender. Fifty years later these people who were not allowed to associate with each other were finally able to connect.
    It all began with the personal journey of a man named Tom Johnson. He grew up in Macon and enjoyed a very successful career which included serving as the publisher of the Los Angeles Times and president of CNN. Tom's life changed drastically over the years, but he still felt the desire to reconnect with his roots.
    In 2005 Johnson returned to Macon with his son, Wyatt. As the pair drove around town,  the father recounted high school stories to his son. He talked about how students attended one of three schools: BallardHudson, Lanier or Miller. Wyatt looked over at his father and said:""Dad  think about how many friends you missed getting to know.""
    Johnson thought about the people he never got the chance to meet. He decided to do something about it.
    The first step was to find people who graduated from all three schools. Johnson wrote to each person and proposed they all get together for a luncheon. He explained that even though they were kept apart during their youth, they didn't have to be separated any more. His classmates received the message with open hearts. A reunion date was set for October.
     More than 200 former Macon students traveled hundreds of miles to reunite with people who went to high school with them. It was an unprecedented event, former students coming together to make up for the time they had lost during the days of segregation.",high20773.txt
