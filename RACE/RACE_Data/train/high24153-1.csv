1,D,"['drinking more water than other animals', 'lying on the ground making strange noise', 'resting in a secret place to avoid enemies', 'being quiet and making little movement']",Sick animals were often seen   _  .,"Folk medicine keeps the body healthy by using medicines taken from surrounding plants and herbs . Since materialsfor making a medicine to cure a sickness can be found everywhere, one can practise folk medicine in any place of the world.
The use of folk medicine goes all the way back to the time of the earliest man when both man and animal used plants and herbs to keep healthy. It is usually seen that an animal eat snakeroot after being bitten by a poisonous snake. Because animals seem to have this natural ability for knowing which plants and herbs will cure what sickness, man probably learned how to care for himself by animal watching.
Man also learned other things from animals. He observed that wild animals, when sick, kept quiet and rest, getting well with the help of the medicine in plants and pure air. He saw that an animal with a fever could often be found resting in a cool place, eating nothing, and often drinking water until the fever was gone.
Some believe that folk medicine deals with a lot of old wives' tales which have something to do with the medical treatment of the body. Stories are told about the powers of a certain vegetable material, which when hung around the neck, brings the wearer good health during the cold winter months. Such a story is simply a fairy tale. It should be separated from the discussion of folk medicine.",high24153.txt
