2,D,"['Bottled water is healthier.', 'Sodas and juices are of great harm.', 'Students think it unfair to ban selling bottled water.', 'The makers of bottled water are against banning selling bottled water.']",Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?,"As is known to us, Washington University in St. Louis became the first college in the United States to ban   selling bottled water in 2009. Since then, more than a dozen small colleges and schools have done the same. The ban isn't because the schools don't want students to have easy access to water. Instead, the goal is to encourage students to bring reusable bottles to save money and, more importantly, to save the environment.
Many people believe that producing and using bottled water not only wastes money but also harms the environment. They say that bottled water is unnecessary because public water supplies in the U.S. are among the best in the world. These people believe that water fountains and reusable bottles with easy access to filling stations are a better choice.
But the makers of bottled water argue that plastic bottles make up a small part of the nation's total waste. They say it's unfair to single out   their product when so many other items are packaged   in plastic containers, and what's more, water is a healthy choice compared to some sodas and juices that are also sold at school.
