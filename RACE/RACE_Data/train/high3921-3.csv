3,B,"['It was very strange.', 'He felt ashamed of it.', 'He took great pride in it.', 'He was puzzled at it.']",What did the husband think of this matter?,"We spent a day in the country, picking wild flowers. With the car full of flowers we were going home. On our way back my wife noticed a cupboard   outside a furniture shop. It was tall and narrow. ""Buy it,"" my wife said at once. ""We'll carry it home on the roof rack  . I've always wanted one like that.""
What could I do? Ten minutes later I was PS20 poorer; and the cupboard was tied on the roof rack. It was six feet long and eighteen inches square, quite heavy too.
In the gathering darkness I drove slowly. Other drivers seemed unusually polite that evening. The police even stopped traffic to let us through. Carrying furniture was a good idea.
After a time my wife said, ""There's a long line of cars behind. Why don't they overtake, I wonder?"" In fact a police car did overtake. The two officers inside looked at us seriously as they passed. But then, with great kindness, they led us through the rush-hour traffic. The police car stopped at our village church. One of the officers came to me.
""Right, sir,"" he said.""Do you need any more help?""
I was a bit puzzled. ""Thanks, officer,"" I said. ""You have been very kind. I live just on the road.""
He was staring at our car, first at the flowers, then at the cupboard. ""Well, well,"" he said, laughing. ""It's a cupboard you've got there! We thought it was something else.""
My wife began to laugh. The truth hit me like a stone between the eyes. I smiled at the officer. "" Yes, it's a cupboard, but thanks again.""I drove home as fast as I could.",high3921.txt
