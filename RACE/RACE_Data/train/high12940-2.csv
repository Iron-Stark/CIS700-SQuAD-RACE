2,C,"['The air pollution in Beijing is not quite serious.', 'The weather in Beijing is good for foreigners to live in.', 'Beijing is quite fit for using the air-cleaning device.', 'It is easy to get the top of the smog in Beijing.']","What does Roosegaarde really mean by saying ""Beijing is quite a good place...... ""?","A Dutch artist and designer has come up with a device which he hopes will get rid of pollutants from Beijing's smog skies, creating clean air for the city's mask-wearing people.
An electromagnetic field  will pull particles  in the smog to the ground where they can be easily cleaned.
""It's like when you have a balloon which has static  and your hair goes toward it. Same with the smog,"" says artist Daan Roosegaarde.
His studio has reached an agreement with the Beijing government to test the technology in one of tile capital's parks.
With its skies regularly covered by dirty gray smog, Beijing this week announced a series of emergency measures to handle the problem.
Roosegaarde says an indoor model device has already proven it works and is confident that the results -- with the help of a team of scientists and engineers -- can be replicated outside.
""Beijing is quite a good place because the smog in Beijing is quite low. It lies in a valley so there's not so much wind. It's a good environment to explore this kind of thing.""
""We'll be able to purify the air and the challenge is to get the top of the smog so you can see the sun again.""
Roosegaarde acknowledges that projects like this are a way of drawing attention to the problem, rather than a practical solution to Beijing's awful air pollution.
""This is not the real answer for smog. The real answer has to do with clean cars, different industry and different lifestyles.""
However, he hopes the project will make a ""fundamental statement"" by allowing the city's people to realize the difference between breathing clean and smog-filled air.",high12940.txt
