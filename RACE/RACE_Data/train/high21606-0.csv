A majority of working women remain in full charge of their home; they come back at night to the cleaning, washing, and cooking that constitute their second career. But more and more husbands are sharing the burden and willingly taking on chores that their fathers would have
rejected as unmanly, and as too mysteriously difficult anyway. In such cases, man and wife become equal partners, both working outside, both pushing the vacuum cleaner, actually, the number of husbands who do help that way is much smaller than the number of those who accept the idea in theory.  _ . The marriage can be destroyed when the wife is more
successful in her profession than her husband in his, particularly when she earns more than he does. Sociologists see in this situation one of the main reasons for the increase in the divorce rate-another reason being the husband's refusal to help with the housework or the care of the children. A third reason could be the growing
awareness of the professional woman that she doesn't hare to remain married if she is too unhappy.",high21606.txt
