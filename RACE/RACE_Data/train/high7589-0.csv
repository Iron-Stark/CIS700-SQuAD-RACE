The result of the match which finished at four this afternoon between France and Wales was a _ . Neither side scored. The Dutch referee did not allow the one goal which France managed to kick. The reason for this was that a French player was unfortunately off side. So both teams went home disappointed with the game. They particularly admired the French forwards, who were always fast and often threatened the Welsh defense. Once it looked as if the Welsh goalkeeper was in serious trouble. He dived to his right to save a shot from the French centre forward and crashed his head against the goal post. A doctor examined him and he soon began to play again. Of course the large, friendly crowd cheered for him. Wales will certainly welcome another visit from this splendid team.",high7589.txt
