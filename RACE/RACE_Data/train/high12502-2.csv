2,C,"['They think themselves connected with Christmas celebrations.', ""They think Christmas is more important than New Year's Day."", 'They want to follow the up-to-date western fashions.', 'They want to part with their hard-earned cash during Christmas.']",Why do some young Shanghainese show great interest in Christmas?,"Walking down any of Shanghai's main shopping streets this week, newcomers might think the locals have been celebrating Christmas for centuries. Christmas may not be a customary holiday in China, but businessmen in Shanghai know it will bring something more valuable than tradition: people are willing to spend money. Most Chinese may feel little connection with the Christmas celebration, but with most shops offering discount  , the message couldn't be clearer-- it is the season to part with one's hard-earned cash.
Much of that marketing drive is directed towards thousands of foreigners and foreign companies that call Shanghai home. But for Shanghai's 13 million locals, regardless of personal interest, there seems no avoiding the season's commercial greetings. Along some major roads, nearly every shop window displays some symbols to the holiday: a man-made fir tree  with lights, or a snowman.
With an increasing number of westerners arriving in the city for work, young Shanghainese, eager to keep pace with the latest western fashions, have begun to show their interest in Christmas. But some people still don't think Christmas is an important festival in China. At least it is less important than the New Year and China's Spring Festival.",high12502.txt
