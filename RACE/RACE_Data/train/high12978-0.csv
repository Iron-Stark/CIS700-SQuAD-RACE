0,A,"[""It's hard to finish a perfect job."", ""you can't stop half way"", 'you may miss the photos somewhere', 'you have to finish it at a time']","While painting a photo, Kathryn thinks   _  .","When Kathryn was 6 years old, she sat outside for three hours at her home and did not make a sound.Her parents wondered why she was so quiet, only to discover that she was drawing a picture of a flag outside. She recalled. ""That's what I wanted to do that day,"" said Kathryn, who is now 23 years old. And in the future, she continued to do art as a hobby.
Recently, Kathryn was named Lake Placid's first artist in the neighborhood. She will be there for at least four weeks and possibly more. During that time, she will teach an art class and focus on her own art. Much of her work includes creating photos. She said: ""There is always something there that you haven't included, so you can never stop when painting a photo.""
Kathryn ended up as the first artist just by chance. She said her sister was on vacation in Florida and looking for a job in Lake Placid. The sister got the job and moved there.
Kathryn said she visited her sister and was ordered to do wall paintings inside a building. Later, her sister saw a demand for an artist on line and suggested she should apply.
Kathryn said she's the first artist in her family, but added that her parents are creative. Her father loves to create things from wood, she said. ""Anything you can make out of wood, he has made it,"" she said.
Her own creativity with art continued through college. While at college, she was once employed to recreate a photo of a couple on a vacation to Florida and one of a sunset in either North Carolina or South Carolina.
Kathryn said she's looking at other forms of art. The time she spends here will help her to ""figure out who I am as an artist,"" she said.",high12978.txt
