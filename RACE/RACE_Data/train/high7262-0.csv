0,D,"['To share his lucky experience.', 'To make his class more lively.', ""To draw all students' attention."", 'To encourage his students to be positive.']",Why did the author tell his students the story?,"I teach geography at UNLV three times per week. Last Monday, at the beginning of class, I cheerfully asked my students how their weekend had been. One young man said that his weekend had not been so good. He had his wisdom teeth removed. The young man then asked me why I always seemed to be so cheerful. ""I choose to be cheerful."" I said. Then I told them a story.
In addition to teaching here at UNLV, I also teach out at the community college in Henderson, 17 miles down the freeway from where I live. One day I drove those 17 miles to Henderson. I exited the freeway and turned onto College Drive. I only had to drive another quarter mile down the road to the college. But just then my car died and wouldn't start again. So I left my car there and marched down the road to the college.
As soon as I got there I called AAA  and arranged for a tow truck   to meet me at my car after class. The secretary in the office asked me what had happened. ""This is my lucky day."" I replied, smiling.
""Your car breaks down and today is your lucky day?"" She was puzzled. ""What do you mean?""
""My car could have broken down anywhere along the freeway but it didn't."" I replied, ""Instead, it broke down in the perfect place: off the freeway, within walking distance from here. I'm still able to teach my class, and I've been able to arrange for the tow truck to meet me after class."" The secretary's eyes opened wide, and then she smiled. I smiled back and headed for class. So ended my story.
I scanned the sixty faces in my class at UNLV. Despite the early hour, no one seemed to be asleep. Somehow, my story had touched them. Or maybe _ In fact, it had all started with a student's observation that I was cheerful. An Indian wise man once said, ""Who you are speaks louder to me than anything you can say."" I suppose it must be so.",high7262.txt
