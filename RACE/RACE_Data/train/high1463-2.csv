2,D,"['to interest her', 'to cure her illness', 'to make friends with her', 'to show their friendliness']",The students brought their photos for the writer to look at  _  .,"On the first day of the new term, I met my new headmaster at the school gate. ""Follow me, please!"" he said. He had a quiet, kind voice. He took me into my new classroom and left. In front of me, thirty pairs of eyes looked at me. I knew he had told the students that I was blind. I could almost feel the question behind their eyes: Blind? I felt the answer too: If she's blind, this should be good! I heard quiet voices in a corner of the classroom. For a moment, I felt afraid. I knew at once that I had to be strong.
""Class,"" I said as loudly as I could. ""I may be blind. But I am not foolish. Take those naughty smiles off your faces, and stop talking, please!"" Of course, I could not see their faces; I just guessed that some of them were smiling. The class were quiet. They were very surprised. I knew that I had done the right thing.
As the days went by, the students had more surprises. I could smell when the children were eating sweets. I could easily hear combs going through hair, students passing messages, and so on. Once I found a girl passing a message to a friend. I took the message to the teachers' room. A teacher read it to me. On one side it said, ""Do you think she can see?"" on the other it said, ""I think so. She always knows what we're doing.""
Soon the students stopped being naughty, and started to work hard. Before long, they brought in photos of their families for me to look at; I knew then they were my friends. I also knew they had forgotten that I could not see.",high1463.txt
