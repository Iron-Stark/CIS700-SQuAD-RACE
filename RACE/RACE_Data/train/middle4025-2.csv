Many people think that some things bring bad luck or good luck. For example, some people think that 13 is an unlucky number. They never invite 13 people to a party.
""I never walk under a ladder  ,"" says Ben. ""And I never open an umbrella inside the house. They both bring bad luck.""
And what brings good luck? ""We have a horseshoe over the front door of our house for good luck,"" says Ben.""And when I find a peney on the ground, I always pick it up. That brings me good luck all day!""",middle4025.txt
