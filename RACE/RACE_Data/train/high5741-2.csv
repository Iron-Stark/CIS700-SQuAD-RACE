2,D,"['Because he was not sure whether he did well.', 'Because he was too excited to write anything.', ""Because he had to wait for Rich Ezzo's permission."", 'Because he wondered if it would have a long influence on him.']",Why didn't the author write the review as soon as he finished reading the book?,"A week ago, I had the great pleasure of reading an e-book, When Money Talks, Listen! by Rich Ezzo. It took only about an hour to read.
When I first received a copy, I thought it was a Get Rich Quick type of publication. Nothing is wrong with Get Rich Quick, but my mind just doesn't run after dreams of wealth. I think that if God ever wants me to be rich, he knows where to find my purse.
When I began reading When Money Talks, Listen!, I was overjoyed to find that Rich Ezzo isn't money hungry either. He, too, is hungry for more important than money.
Since I love this e-book so much, why wait a week to write the review? Simple. I wanted to see if the effect it had on me was a keeper. After reading the last word of the e-book, I totally agreed with the subtitle   which promised to forever change the way we thought about money. I had so many thoughts running around my mind that I had to install   a stoplight to stop some while others made their way into the picture, then I yielded   them as a few ones arrived in town. I had a mental traffic jam, which only goes to show how slow the traffic usually is.
It has been a week and the effect is the same. I truly do look at money differently and have even done a few things differently this week. This is an e-book you 'll want to read, I promise. I often recommend books to my daughter, and this is one that I didn't just ""suggest""----I left it open at the bottom of the compute and told each one ,""Read it, you'll love it "".
I would never point someone in a direction I wouldn't go myself. I strongly advise you to visit the author's website, Myster Money, and to download the e-book. You won't regret it.",high5741.txt
