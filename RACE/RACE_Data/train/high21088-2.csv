Rainbows are also important symbols in a number of cultures around the world.
In the Old Testament of the Bible(<<>> ), for example, God shows Noah a rainbow to let him know that the Flood is over and that he will never destroy the earth again with flooding. 
When it rains, the color1s that make up white light separate because they bend at different angles when they pass through water. The result is some of the color1s can be seen by the human eyes, as well as some that cannot.
