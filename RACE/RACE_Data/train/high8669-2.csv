2,A,"['tell us a funny story', 'show us how to take care of a person who is drunk', 'tell us how bad it is to be drunk', ""suggest we shouldn't get drunk""]",The passage is intended to   _  .,"A man wakes up with a big hangover  the morning after attending his company's annual Summer Party. He can't even remember how he got home from the party, let alone how he got so drunk and is deathly afraid of what he may have done or said the night before to make his wife angry.
The man forces his eyes open and the first things he sees are two headache tablets next to a glass of water on his table, and, next to them, a single red rose! He sits up with difficulty and sees his clothing hung on the back of his chair all clean and pressed and the rest of the house all in perfect order.
Incredulous , the man takes the tablets and sees a black eye looking back at him from the bathroom mirror. Then he finds a note next to the red rose on the table, ""Sweetie, breakfast is waiting for you on the stove. I left early to buy the cooking materials to make your favorite dinner tonight. I love you, darling! "" The note was signed, ""Your loving wife.""
The man then walks into the kitchen. His daughter Jessie is at the table, eating. ""Jessie...what happened last night?"" The man asks, with great fear.
""Well, you came home around four o'clock in the morning, drunk and out of your mind. You tripped and fell onto the coffee table and broke it, and got this black eye when you crashed into the table's edge.""
Puzzled, the man asks Jessie, ""Then why is there a rose on my table and breakfast on the stove waiting for me?""
""Oh that,"" Jessie replies, ""well, Mom pulled you into your bedroom, and when she tried to undress you, you yelled, 'Leave me alone; I'm married and I love my wife!'""",high8669.txt
