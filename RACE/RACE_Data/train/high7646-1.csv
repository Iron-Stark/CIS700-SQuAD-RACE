1,C,"['It can move forward and backward and pick up two objects at the same time.', 'It can move forward,pick up both objects and bring them to either location.', 'It can only move forward,pick up one object and put it in one location.', 'It can read all human thought demands and do as instructed.']",Which of the following is TRUE about the robot?,"Scientists have created a way to control a robot with signals from human brain.By generating the proper brainwaves--picked up by a cap with electrodes   that sense the signals and reflect a person's instructions--scientists can instruct a humanoid  robot to move to specific locations and pick up certain objects.
The commands are limited to moving forward,picking up one of two objects and bringing it to one of two locations.The researchers have achieved 94 percent accuracy between the thought commands and the robot's movements.
""This is really a proofofconcept demonstration,"" said Rajesh Rao,a researcher from the University of Washington who leads the project.""It suggests that one day we might be able to use semiautonomous robots for such jobs as helping disabled people or performing routine tasks in a person's home.""
The person wearing the electrode cap watches the robot's movements on a computer screen through two cameras installed on and above the robot.
When the robot's cameras see the objects that are to be picked up they pass on the information to the user's computer screen.Each object lights up randomly on the computer screen.When a person wants something picked up and it happens to light up,the brain registers surprise and sends this brain activity to the computer and then to the robot.The robot then proceeds to pick up the object.
A similar algorithm  is used to decide where the robot will go.
""One of the important things about this demonstration is that we're using a 'noisy' brain signal to control the robot,"" Rao said.""That means we can only obtain brain signals indirectly from sensors on the surface of the head,not where they are generated deep in the brain.As a result,the user can only generate highlevel commands such as indicating which object to pick up or which location to go to,and the robot needs to be autonomous enough to be able to execute such commands.""
In the future,the researchers hope to make the robots more adaptive to the environment by having them carry out more complex commands.",high7646.txt
