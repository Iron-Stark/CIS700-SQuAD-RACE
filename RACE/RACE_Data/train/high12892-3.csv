3,A,"['are still a must on certain occasions', 'are certain to return sooner or later', 'are still being taught by parents at home', 'can help improve personal relationships']","Formal table manners, though less popular than before in current Social life,  _  .","When families gather for Christmas dinner, some will stick to formal traditions dating back to grandma's generation. Their tables will be set with the good dishes and silver, and the dress code will be Sunday best.
But in many other homes, this china-and-silver elegance has given way to a stoneware   and stainless informality, with dresses assuming an equally casual-Friday look.

In a time of long work hours and demanding family schedules, busy hosts insist, rightly, that it's better to share a takeout pizza on paper plates in the family room than to wait for the perfect moment or a ""real"" dinner party.
Too often, the perfect moment never comes. Iron a fine-patterned tablecloth? Forget it. Polish the silver? Who has time? Yet the loss of formality has its down side. The fine points of etiquette   that children might once have learned at the table by observation or instruction from parents and grandparents ("" Chew with your mouth closed."" ""Keep your elbows off the table. "") must be picked up else-where.
