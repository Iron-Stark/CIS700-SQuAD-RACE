3,A,"['The early fish gets the bird.', 'Nico Smit and an African tigerfish.', 'Nico Smit and his research team.', 'The Mapungubwe National Park']",Which is the best title for the passage?,"January 16, 2014 - We know the saying ""The early bird gets the worm"", but today you're going to  learn about the interesting saying ""The early fish gets the bird.""
An African tigerfish  was seen jumping out of the air and catching a flying bird. The African tigerfish has bright red fins and very sharp teeth. There have been rumors  this kind of fish preys on  birds since the 1940s, but no one was able to catch _ .
""The whole action of jumping and catching happens so quickly that after we saw it, it took all of us a moment to really understand what we had just seen,"" said Nico Smit from Environmental Sciences and Management at North-West University.
Smit and his research team saw it at a lake in the Mapungubwe National Park in South Africa during summer. They found about 20 fish feeding on birds in the morning. Those birds may be out early to look for food, but we will never know for sure!",middle2639.txt
