He told us how tragedy had struck at his home,not once,but twice. The first time he had lost his fiveyearold daughter. He and his wife thought they couldn't bear that first loss;but,as he said,""Ten months later,God gave us another little girl and she died in five days.""

""At last he went to doctors;one recommended sleeping pills and another recommended a trip,but neither helped. He said,""My body felt as if it was surrounded in a vice  ,and the jaws of the vice were being drawn tighter and tighter.""

In my case,building the boat had knocked worry out of the ring. So I determined to keep busy.""
""The following night,I made a list of jobs that ought to be done. Scores of items needed to be repaired. Amazingly,I had made a list of 242 items that needed attention. During the last two years I have completed  most of them. I am busy so that I have no time for worry.""
No time for worry!That is exactly what Winston Church ill said when he was working eighteen hours a day at the height of the war. When he was asked if he worried about his huge responsibilities,he said,""I am too busy. I have no time for worry.""",high12163.txt
