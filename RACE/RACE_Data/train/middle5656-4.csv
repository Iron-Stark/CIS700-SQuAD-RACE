4,C,"['Boring.', 'Tiring.', 'Exciting.', 'Relaxing.']",What did John think of horse-riding?,"Here are four of my friends. Get to know them and their interesting experiences.
I'm Mark. I'm 12. I have learned a lot about cycling and cycled about two hundred miles   with my friends. We all felt very excited.
My name is Sam. I'm one year older than Mark. I have entered a competition. At last, I won it and the prize was a seven---day holiday to my favourite country --America.
You can call me Linda. I'm the same age as Mark. I have been to Hong Kong Disneyland with my parents. I was excited to see so many cartoon characters  because I often dreamed about them.
John is my name. I'm one year younger than Sam. I have learned to ride a horse because I thought it was exciting. Before I learned it, I fell off the horse many times. But that was very interesting for me.",middle5656.txt
