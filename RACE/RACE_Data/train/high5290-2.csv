2,A,"['The man is not honest,and so is his assistant', 'The cure for old age is very useful and not so expensive. .', 'The cheaper the medicine is,the more people will buy.', 'The two men are very honest,and they would like to help people live forever.']",What does this passage really mean?,"A man was selling medicine at a fair .At first he sold bottles of a cure for colds for just a dollar a bottle.
Many people wanted to buy it and the man's young assistant moved quickly through the crowd collecting money and handing out bottles of the cure.
Then,when he had a big crowd, the man held up a very small bottle.
""And now,ladies and gentlemen,he shouted,""Here is the medicine you have been waiting for.The cure for old age.Drink just one bottle of this and you will live forever.
""And,ladies and gentlemen,the man continued,""I'm not going to charge(............)you a hundred dollars a bottle for this wonderful medicine.I'm not going to charge you fifty dollars a bottle.I'm not going to charge you twenty-five dollars a bottle.Now,ladies and gentlemen,I'm going to charge you just ten dollars a bottle. Think,my friends,for ten dollars you can live forever.
Most of the people in the crowd did not believe this.
One person shouted,""If it can make you live forever,why don't you drink it?Then another person cried,""Yes, you look as if you're at least sixty years old.
""Thank you,sir,thank you,the man answered,""I'm so glad you said that. My real age is three hundred and twenty-nine.
The crowd laughed at this but there were still some people who wanted to believe the man .One of them spoke to the man's assistant as she passed by,""Is that true?he asked.""Is he three hundred and twenty-nine?
""Don't ask me,the assistant said,""I've only worked for him for a hundred and fifty years.",high5290.txt
