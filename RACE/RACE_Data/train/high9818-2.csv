2,B,"['A traveI guide.', 'A scientific report.', 'A medical record.', 'An official document.']",What type of writing is this passage?,"If you're secretly worried about your smartphone addiction, then the new NoPhone might be just the thing you need.It looks and feels exactly like a smartphone,but it does nothing.It's just a piece of plastic that you can carry around in your hand to fool yourself.
Dutch designer lngmar Larsen came up with the idea as a joke along with his two friends.To their great surprise,the idea received a lot of attention online and people from all over the world stated placing requests for NoPhones of their own.So that's when the three friends decided to turn to collect enough fund for mass production.
NoPhone is currently a prototype that will cost only $12 once it hits the market.It is 5.5 inches high,2.6 inches wide and 0.29 inches thick, bringing it quite close to the latest smartphones on the market.It is described as""battery free"",""no upgrades necessary"",""shatterproof "",""waterproof''and""an alternative to constant hand-to-phone contact that allows you to stay connected with the real world"".
""Phone addiction is everywhere.""the designers insist.""It's ruining your dates.It's distracting you at concerts.It's blocking sidewalks.Now,there is a real solution.With a thin.1ight and completely wireless design,the NoPhone acts as a substitute to any smart mobile device,enabling you to always have a phone to hold without giving up potential engagement with your direct environment.""
If you're interested in NoPhone,but concerned about not being able to take selfies  anymore.Don't feel upset.The makers do have an upgrade at no extra charge--the mirror sticker.That way,they say,you can enjoy'real-time'selfies with your friends when they're standing right behind you.",high9818.txt
