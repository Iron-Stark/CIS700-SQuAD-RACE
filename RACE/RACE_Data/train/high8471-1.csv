1,B,"['Carrying out your promise', 'Never wanting much in life', 'Depending on God', 'Brushing away your worries']",What is Susan's secret of happiness?,"A woman Vicki once knew a young person named Susan at church. Susan always seemed happy, although Vicki knew she had faced struggles in her life. Her long-awaited marriage had quickly ended in divorce, but her whole face seemed to smile.
One day Vicki asked Susan,""How is it that you are always so happy, you have so much energy, and you never seem to get down?""
With her eyes smiling, Susan said,""I know the secret!""
""What secret is that? What are you talking about?""Vicki asked.
Susan replied,""The secret is this: I have learned there is little I can do in my life that will make me truly happy. I must depend on God to make me happy and meet my needs. When a need arises in my life, I have to trust God to supply according to HIS riches. I have learned most of the time I don't need half of what I think I do. He has never let me down. Since I learned that secret, I am happy.""
Vicki thought first, ""That's too simple!"" But upon reflecting over her own life, she remembered how she thought a bigger house would make her happy, but it didn't! She thought a better-paying job would make her happy, but it didn't. When did she realize her greatest happiness? Sitting on the floor with her grandchildren, playing games, eating pizza or reading a story, this is a simple gift from God.",high8471.txt
