0,B,"[""it was based on Tu's real life"", 'it was written in literary style', 'the readers had passions for science', ""the readers knew about the origin of Tu's given name""]",The reason why many readers were moved to tears by the fake speech is that   _  .,"A funny thing happened between China's first female Nobel Prize winner, Tu Youyou, giving her acceptance speech in Sweden and that speech reaching her home country: Two entirely different versions appeared, and the fake one became a viral hit.
Guess which version is genuine? The one that matter-of-factly tells about the discovery of artemisinin , or the one with extreme literary style, complete with her father explaining the origin of her given name and poetic lines such as, ""I like tranquility , tranquil as the leaves of sweet wormwood .""
Most readers were so touched by the literary version that they were left in tears. However, they just forgot that Tu is not a woman of _ , but one of science. It was totally made up by someone who obviously has great literary talent, but could not fathom the inner life of a scientist.
I don't know who made up the Tu speech, or for what purpose. It does not strike me as funny. Fortunately, no mainstream media seemed to have been fooled. Yet the fake one has probably been shared more than the real one because it played to the Chinese stereotype  of what such a speech should be.

There is a joke that says the United States' spying network collected and examined all the Internet data in China and found that the Chinese are addicted to such chicken soup, including that from untrustworthy sources.",high14683.txt
