A new study finds that fear of losing your phone is a common illness. About 66 percent of those surveyed suffer from _ or ""no mobile phone phobia"". Interestingly, more women worry about losing their phone than men.
Fortunately, there's a solution.

You'll have complete peace of mind knowing that your phone is protected and you can quickly reconnect with family, friends and work, as soon as the very next day!""",high1711.txt
