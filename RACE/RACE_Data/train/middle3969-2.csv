2,C,"['the NBA', 'college life', 'growing up', 'having a hobby']","""Hoops"" is a book about   _  .","I had never really liked reading and thought it was a waste of time. But once my teacher told our class to go to the library and find our favorite books. I love basketball, so I picked out a basketball book. It was called ""Hoops"" by Water Dean Myers. It is a good novel, and suitable for basketball lovers.
This story is about a high school ball player named Lonnie. Lonnie lives in a poor family in Harlem, New York. He is a good basketball player and dreams of playing basketball in college, and of course in the NBA. When Cal, his new coach, walks into his life, he just wants to keep away from him. But at last they become friends and face many challenges together.
I am now reading more of Walter Dean Myers' books. A lot of his books are about growing up in Harlem, just like he did. However, I like ""Hoops"" best. From Lonnie, you will learn that the people around you really affect who you are, and how much it helps to have the support of family and friends in your life.
This book also makes me think about how hard it would be to grow up in a rough  neighborhood. I have realized that we must believe in ourselves when life gets hard. I have learned a lot from this book, and I think anyone will learn much after reading it.
It is a good story, and I really suggest that everyone read it. I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I do.",middle3969.txt
