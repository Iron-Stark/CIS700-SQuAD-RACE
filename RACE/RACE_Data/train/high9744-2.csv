2,C,"['Both the man and woman are financially secure.', 'Husband and wife share housework.', 'Both the man and woman are well-educated.', 'Decisions are made by the man and woman together.']",What kind of marriage can be successful?,"In many homes, divorce is caused by the ""battle between the sexes."" To understand the problem, one must remember that the modern American woman is freed. During childhood and adolescence , the American girl is given freedom and education which is equal to a boy's. After completing school, she is able to get a job and support herself. She doesn't have to marry for financial security. She considers herself an independent, self-sufficient person. She wants a husband whom she can respect, but she doesn't want to be dominated  by him. She wants a democratic household in which she has a voice in making decisions. When a husband and wife are able to share decisionmaking, their marriage is probably closer, stronger, and more satisfying. Otherwise, the couple is likely to wind up in the divorce court.
When a couple gets divorced, the court usually requires the man to pay his former wife a monthly sum of money. If the couple has children, they usually remain with the mother, and the father is expected to pay for their support.
Although divorce is quite common in the United States, 80 percent of those who get divorced remarry. The remarriages allow thousands of people, especially children, to enjoy family life again, but at the same time many troubles have arisen. A well-known American joke tells of a wife calling to her second husband, ""Quick, John! Come here and help me! Your children are beating up our chidlren!""",high9744.txt
