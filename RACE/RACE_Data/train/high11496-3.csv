One day the headmaster of a school wrote to the post-office and asked for a post-office box for his school. He soon got an answer. It said, ""We will give you a post-office box in one month.""
Three months later, the headmaster wrote to the post-office and said, ""Why haven't we got a post-office box yet?""
