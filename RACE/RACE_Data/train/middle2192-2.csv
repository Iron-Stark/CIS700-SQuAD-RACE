2,D,"['He feels sorry', 'He feels happy', 'He becomes frightened', 'He becomes angry']","What does the phrase ""he sees red"" mean in this passage?","Dear Annie,
I have never written a letter to a newspaper before, I have just never felt the need to do such a thing. I have always felt I was quite able to do everything by myself. But now I know I was wrong.
Sometimes you really need help in life, I guess. And that's why I'm writing this letter to you.
I have a happy family. I love my children and they love me . I'm a mother of three children. I know well how to bring up  children, and two of them are already over twenty, so it is nothing new for me.
But now I have a serious problem: the Internet problem. My little son is just sixteen, and I feel he should do a lot of homework now , but he doesn't seem to be interested in it . He can happily spend six or eight hours at a time on the Internet every day , He chats with people that he has never met before , but speaks little to us .He does lots of useless things on the Internet. And he sees red if you ask him to do his homework.
I just want him to be a good student . Now he seldom does his lessons at home. I'm afraid he will drop behind in his class soon. His father is a doctor , a very kind man . He never seems to be afraid of his father.
What can I do ?And don't tell to talk to him. We've tried that and it didn't work. But this is really a big problem in our family. I have tried everything I can think of . I
wonder how the Internet is so attractive .You're my last hope. Please tell me what I can do!
Yours,
Ellen Smith",middle2192.txt
