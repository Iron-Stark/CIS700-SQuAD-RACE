Key West is the most southern city in the continental USA. That is why their sunsets are so amazing. The sun is brighter there at sunset than anywhere else. It's so beautiful that everyone gathers every evening at Mallory Dock to watch it. And there you will see jugglers   and musicians entertaining in the streets.
The houses surrounded by trees and flowers are lovely in Key West, and many are restored and absolutely charming. There are too many hotels, inns, guest houses and restaurants to talk about. They all look great and their prices change according to seasons, and you can find something to suit every pocketbook and every taste.
At the seaport you will see various boats. It's very interesting. The city is rich in history and was home to Ernest Hemingway. Harry Truman chose it for his winter White House. There are so many public transportation--taxis, tour trains, trolleys, bikes--and you can even walk if you choose. There are beautiful coral reefs. The deep reefs are farther off shore and are best visited with an experienced guide. However, there are shallow reefs close in where snorkelers   can explore to their heart's content. At Key West Marine Park you can do some good snorkeling.  In Key West you can go diving, fishing and do all sorts of water sports.
The problem with Key West is that no one ever wants to leave. Be sure to take your camera with you because you will want to snap   everything you see. And whatever you do, be sure to take in the sunset because it is nothing like anything you have ever seen.",high248.txt
