4,A,"['the Indian was a young man', 'the doctor was a good doctor', 'the Indian would go on smoking', ""the doctor wasn't very careful""]",From the story we can guess_.,"One day an Indian went to see his doctor. The doctor looked him over and said, ""Medicine won't help you. You must have a good rest. Go to a quiet country place for a month, go to bed early, drink milk, walk a lot, and smoke only one cigar  a day.""
A month later, the Indian came to see the doctor again. ""How are you?"" said the doctor. ""I'm glad to see you again. You look much younger."" ""Oh, doctor, I feel quite well now,"" said the Indian, ""I had a good rest. I went to bed early. I drank a lot of milk. I walked a lot. You certainly helped me. But you told me to smoke one cigar a day, and that almost  killed me at first. It was not easy to begin smoking at my age.""",middle1282.txt
