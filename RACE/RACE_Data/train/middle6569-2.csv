Why?""Mr. Malone stopped Julia as she walked by his desk. Julia explained , ""I'm sorry . I was cleaning the tables in the science room . Someone spilled the chemical , so cleaning took me longer than usual . ""
Mr. Malone replied . ""I've talked to you about your lateness . I am afraid you won't be able to go with us in the field trip .""""But..."" Julia cried . Mr. Malone stopped her . ""Unless your parent comes in to discuss this with headmaster and me , you won't be attending . ""
After dinner , Julia found the courage to talk to her dad . She told about the messy science tables and how her science teacher would deduct points from their daily grades if they did not clean up . Her friends' next class was on the opposite side of the building . Since her class was nearby , Julia volunteered to help clean up so that her friends would not be late . Then she explained how this would prevent her from attending the school trip . Her dad watched her for several seconds . Finally , he simply said , ""I'll be there right after school .""
The next day after school , Julia walked to the office . Her father and Mr. Malone were already there . Mrs. Thompson , the headmaster , spoke , ""Julia , why were you cleaning the science tables alone ?""
Julia answered slowly ,""I guess no one wants to clean up , and I don't want my friends to get into trouble . """"But you got yourself in trouble . ""Mrs. Thompson said . Julia nodded . Julia's dad continued , ""You're still responsible for breaking the rules ; even if it was for a good reason . Do you have any ideas for a punishment ? "" Julia shook her head hopelessly .
""Normally , your lateness would prevent you from attending some school activities . However , I have considered the reason and will allow you to go on the trip . ""Mrs. Thompson said . Julia jumped out of her seat , repeating , ""Thank you , thank you , thank you ! """"Don't be too excited . You'll have a one-day detention   for each lateness . ""Mrs. Thompson warned , ""I hope you won't be late again . ""
""No , madam , I won't ."" Julia replied , smiling from ear to ear .",middle6569.txt
