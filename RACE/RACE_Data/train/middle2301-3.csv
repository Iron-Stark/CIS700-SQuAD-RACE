3,C,"['If you get lost in the forest, you should try your best to find your friends.', 'When you hear whistles for twice, that means someone needs help.', 'If you leave branches to look for water, you can find your way back easily.', 'When you are lost, the important thing to do is to cry.']",Which of the following statement is RIGHT?,"If you go into the forest with friends, stay with them. If you don't, you may get lost. Sit down and stay where you are. Don't try to find your friends, but let them find you instead . You can help them find you by staying in one place. There is another way to help your friends or other people to find you. You can shout or whistle three times. Stop for a while. Then shout or whistle three times again. Any signal given three times is a help.
Keep up shouting or whistling. Always three times together. When people hear you, they will know that you are not just making a noise for fun. They will let you know that they have heard your signal. They will give you two shouts or two whistles. When a signal is given twice, it is an answer to a call for help.
If you don't think that you will get help before night comes, try to make a little house with branches . Make yourself a bed with leaves and grass.
When you need some water, you have to leave your little branch house to look for it. Don't just walk away. _ When you are lost, the most important thing to do is stay in one place.",middle2301.txt
