You are not alone
Remember that everybody else in your grade is in the same boat. You may not notice it, but they are just as nervous as you are.
Moving up to senior high school is a chance, not a problem. Things are different, and all you need to do is be polite and learn the new rules.
The teachers will help
If you don't know what to do or are worried about something, then ask for help. Teachers are probably the best people to turn to because they have experience in helping new students.
Everything changes
There are lots of differences between junior high school and senior high school. You will have your lessons with different teachers in different rooms. You will have homework for different subjects on different days, so make sure you get organized.
Other points
If you've got an elder brother or sister at senior high school, then ask them for advice.
Be yourself! It sounds simple, but people will respond much better to you if you act naturally.
Going to bed early makes a difference. You'll also find it easier to get up in the morning!",high11877.txt
