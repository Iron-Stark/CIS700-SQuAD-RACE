0,D,"['it explained the origin of the universe', 'it has sold 10 million copies up to now', 'it spent 147 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List', ""it included Hawking's four life lessons on how to become a genius""]",The passage tells us the facts about A Brief History of Time EXCEPT that   _  .,"As we all know, Stephen Hawking writes the book A Brief History of Time that explains the origin of the universe. The book spent 147 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List and has sold 10 million copies. He is, most agree, very smart.
In his recently published autobiography My Brief History,Hawking offers four life lessons on
how to become a genius.
1) Don' t miss opportunities by being too cool
""We showed an air of complete boredom and the feeling that nothing was worth making an effort for. One result of my illness has been to change all that. When you are faced with the possibility of an early death, it makes you realize that life is worth living and that there are lots of things you want to do."" Seize the moment, as Oxford would say.
2) Keep it simple
When writing A Brief History of Time,he tried to make science understandable for the rest of
Us. ""I was sure that nearly everyone is interested in how the universe operates, but most people
cannot follow mathematical equations . ""He has trouble with them, too.""This is partly because it is difficult for me to write them down, but mainly because I don't have an inborn feeling for equations. My aim in the book was to describe these mental images in words. It is such an easy book that everybody can understand it."" The moral: You don't have to be a genius to know everything.
3)Have fun
Hawking has a long history of being a joker,and he has placed lots of bets with other scientists on the nature of black holes. One was with Cal-Tech scientist John Preskill. After paying off his bet by giving Preskill a baseball encyclopedia, Hawking wrote,""but maybe I should have just given him the ashes."" So lighten up! Geniuses like bad jokes too.
4) Always look for a silver lining (even if you are seriously ill)
Hawking's disease has slowly robbed him of the ability to walk,move his arms,even speak.
But, Hawking says,""in some ways I guess my disability has been an assist:I haven't had to lecture or teach students, and I haven't had to sit in meetings. So I have been able to devote myself completely to research.""In other words, Hawking was given lemons, and he made Champagne.",high7873.txt
