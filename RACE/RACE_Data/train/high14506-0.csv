0,C,"['it will bring us trouble in holiday reunion', 'it will be out of fashion soon in future', 'Mr. Dong is in favor of the digital hongbao', 'lots of people will use it to earn money']",What can we infer from what Mr. Dong said about digital hongbao   _  .,"The Spring Festival is supposed to be a period of time entirely for family reunion. However, as people's enthusiasm for digital hongbao increased, the amount of the time they spend with family members during the holiday decreases. There has been widespread criticism  over digital hongbao that it has _ family reunion.
""I used to discuss programs in the Spring Festival Gala  with my family members, but this year, I hardly had the time to watch the gala because I was staring at my cellphone all the time,"" said Kang, a 30-year old radio station editor. ""I went to Karaoke with my cousins during the holiday, and I was grasping digital hongbao the whole time, even when I was singing Karaoke.""
""On the last day of the holiday, I started to regret spending too much time on these digital hongbao. Therefore, instead of fighting for hongbao, I watched TV with my mom that night. I left home feeling sorry! I should have spent more time with my parents.""
But Kang said regret came with a sense of achievement when he managed to bring classmates together.
""Next year, I will still play the game, but with less money and for a smaller amount of time,"" Kang said.
Dong Chenyu, a teacher from Beijing Foreign Studies University, said it unfair to blame hongbao for destroying family reunion.
""When television was invented, people accused it of standing in the way of face-to-face human communication. The same accusation came up on telephone and text message services when they were first invented. The same goes with digital hongbao,"" Dong said.
""It does nothing but offers a new way of human communication. The rest is people's choice. As long as no one expects to earn money from this and takes this as a means of gambling , it's a good way to improve human connections,"" Dong said.",high14506.txt
