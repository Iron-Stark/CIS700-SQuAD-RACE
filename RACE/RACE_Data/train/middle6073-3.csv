3,D,"['Every child hopes to be an adult.', 'The writer thinks that he works and studies like an adult.', 'The competition among classmates give children greater pressure.', 'The expectation from parents seldom brings children worries.']",Which of the following statements is NOT right?,"Every child has his own dream. Every child hopes to be an adult. However, is it truly like what they imagine? As a boy who lives in modern times and in a modern city, I feel greater pressure  on me with the city's development. Although we seldom worry about money, we still have a lot of things such as competition among classmates and expectations from parents. These experiences are very helpful to our future. But in fact they really give me a lot of pressure. I still clearly remembered the happiness of my childhood. Unluckily, we had to face the fact with time passing by. We began to feel this invisible  pressure come upon us. We get up before sunrise and return after sunset. We work and study like an adult, even harder. What we do is to get an excellent mark. Oh, growing up is completely boring. We must try to find happiness while growing up. I think the friendship among our friends, the support from our parents and the encouragement among our teachers can help us. Why not enjoy the pleasure of growing up?",middle6073.txt
