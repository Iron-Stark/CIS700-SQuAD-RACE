2,D,"['choose to live in the country', 'break up with her boyfriend at once', 'ask their teachers and parents for help', 'have a better understanding of marriage']","After taking the course, Marianne will   _   .","In a very special course at Knnet School, the social-science teacher Adam Smith guides his students through the ""married life"". Unlike the traditional course, Adam makes his students experience the real problems married ones may face like housing and child care. ""No one tells kids about money-managing problems,"" says Adam.
Each student should act out in ten weeks what normally takes couples ten years to finish. In the first week, one member of each couple is asked to get an after school job -- a real one. During the term, the income rules their life-style. In the third week, the couples must find an apartment they can afford.
In the fifth week, the couples ""have a baby"" and then struggle to cover the costs of baby clothes and furniture. In week eight, the marriage comes to the breaking point by such disaster as a mother-in-law's moving in or death. It's all over by week ten (the tenth year of marriage). After serious discussion with lawyers about alimony   and child support, the students get divorced   .
Adam's course, which has ""married"" 1,000 students since its beginning six years ago, is widely supported by parents and students. Some of the students have found the experience making them realize their real life marry plans are wrong. Marianne Baldrica, 16, who tried ""marriage"" last term with her boyfriend Eric Zook, 15, said, "" Eric and I used to get along pretty well before we took the course together. But I wanted to live in the city, he wanted the country. He wanted lots of kids, I wanted no kids. It's been four weeks since the course ended and Eric and I are just starting to talk to each other again.""",high13320.txt
