2,A,"['85 yuan.', '82 yuan.', '50 yuan.', '35 yuan.']",How much did the children get in total ?,"There was a big garden in front of Jeff's house. So on weekends, many children came to play soccer from morning to late night. They made a lot of noise, so Jeff couldn't do anything.
He thought hard and had an idea. One Saturday evening, he went out and said to them, ""It is my happy time when I see and hear you playing here. So I will give you fifty yuan a week if you play in the garden here,""
They felt very happy and on Saturday evening they came to Jeff's house and asked for the money. He did so.
The second week, Jeff said he didn't have enough money and only gave them twenty yuan.
The third week Jeff said he lost his work, but he gave them only 10 yuan. And the boys were very _ .
The fourth week Jeff said he was looking for his job. He gave them only five yuan. And said he couldn't pay them fifty yuan a week. But he would give them two yuan each week.
After that, the boys never played in the garden again.",middle7691.txt
