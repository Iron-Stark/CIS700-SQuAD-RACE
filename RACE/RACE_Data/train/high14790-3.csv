He thinks this is more encouraging, gentler, and therefore the wanted answer. So the American drives through the night, getting more and more angry, feeling ""being tricked"". He thinks the man on purpose lied to him, for obviously he must have known the distance quite well.
Had conditions been reversed  , the American would have felt he was ""cheating"" the driver if he had said the next town was not too far, and if he would be sorry to the weary driver, he would say ""You have a good way to go yet, it is at least fifteen miles."" The driver might be disappointed, but he would know what to expect.
