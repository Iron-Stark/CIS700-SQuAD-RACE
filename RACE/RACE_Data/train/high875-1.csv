I asked why, and she said she could get all the short stories she wanted off the Internet. Saved walking all the way to the library, and putting up with my long chat on the way there, and on the way back. Maybelle is very direct like that, always has been.
""But, Maybelle, we've been walking to the library every' Monday for the last fifty years!""
She said,"" Why don't you get Internet'? We can send each other emails.""
So I had to get Internet. I called the local high school. They said they'd send me a good student to tell me all about computers and such.

""Let's buy a computer and get hooked up, then.""
""How much you want to spend?""

When I opened the garage door, he gasped. Daddy's car is still there, a'57 Chevy. I never drive it. Walk everywhere.
I said,"" Let's walk. It's only a mile or so.""
He said,"" Let's drive, or you will faint on me in this heat.""
""Young man, I don't faint, never have. We're walking.""
""I get paid by the hour,"" he said. ""Walking will cost you a lot more. Also, you feel like carrying a computer a mile or so?""",high875.txt
