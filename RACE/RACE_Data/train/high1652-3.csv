3,A,"['Lending your voice to ""talking bins""', 'Sing London art organization', 'A campaign named Bin Thinking', 'A new experiment on litter bins']",What would be the best title for the text?,"Would the voice of Amanda Holden saying ""your city had talent"" encourage you to use a litter bin? Or maybe former Monty Python star Michael Palin telling you no one had expected ""the Spanish bin-quisition""?
Organizers of a plan persuading celebrities to lend their voices to ""talking bins""believe it can make a real difference to keeping Britain tidy. They hope that by using humor, they will succeed where fines and warnings have failed in keeping streets and parks clean.
A similar experiment in Sweden found a talking bin received nearly three times as much rubbish as an ordinary one because people were attracted by its quality of being new and unusual value.
Twenty-five specially adapted bins to be installed in the streets of London and Liverpool next  month will use a sound card to play a themed message when litter is placed inside. For example,one near the Royal Opera House will play a ""thank-you"" message sung by Janis Kelly to the tune of Nessun Dorina. Bins installed in Liverpool will play Beatles-themed messages. For others,Britain's Got Talent  judge Holden is expected to record the message:""This is Amanda, and this city's got talent.""
The campaign,entitled Bin Thinking, is being organized by art group Sing London. If successful,talking bins could become a familiar feature on Britain's streets.
Colette Hiller, director of Sing London, said, "" The idea is to reward people in a small way for changing their behavior and raise awareness through a sense of fun.""",high1652.txt
