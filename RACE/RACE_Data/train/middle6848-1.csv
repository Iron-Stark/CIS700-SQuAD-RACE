1,D,"['My good neighbour.', 'A basketball game.', 'A strange man.', 'Seeing is believing.']",Which of the following can be the title for this passage?,"A few years ago I didn't knew my neighbour Mr Reed well. Now we're friends.
It all started from a basketball game near his home. Peter passed the ball to me. But I didn't catch it and it went right into Mr Reed's garden.Everyone said that he didn't like children. Nobody dared  to get the ball. And no one knew Mr Reed well because he _ came out of his house. And he _ talked with others.
I walked into Mr Reed's garden slowly and quietly. My hands were sweaty . Suddenly I saw a tall man walking towards me. It was Mr Reed.
""Is this your ball?"" he asked.
I said yes and said never to do it again.
To my surprise, Mr Reed said, ""Why don't you kids play here? No one has used this hoop for years. It's better than yours.""
My friends and I couldn't believe it. Mr Reed was inviting us to play in his garden! We all learned an important lesson: what many people say isn't always true.",middle6848.txt
