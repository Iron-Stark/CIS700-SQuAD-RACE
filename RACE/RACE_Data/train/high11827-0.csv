0,B,"[""Children don't like reading any more after the age of 8."", 'Most children like reading as well as going online.', 'All kids like reading e - books instead of printed ones.', 'Most children like going online instead of reading.']",What can we learn from the text?,"The saying that children don't like reading any more has been proved untrue. A new study finds that 75 percent of kids between five and 17 say that although they love technology, they still want to read books.
The Kids & Family Reading Report also says that 62 percent of kids prefer reading printed books rather than those on a computer.At the same time, those who search an author's website or use the Internet to find books by a particular author, are more likely to read books for fun every day.
The study also once again proves that the time kids spend reading books for fun decreases after the age of eight and continues to drop through the teen years.The report is a follow-up to a 2006 study.But this time the focus is on the role of technology and when kids' interest in reading starts to drop.
""Despite the fact that after the age of eight more children go online daily than read for fun daily, high frequency Internet users are more likely to read books for fun every day,"" says Heather Carter, a writer of the report.
One in four kids between five and 17 say they read books for fun every day and more than half of kids say they read books for fun at least two to three times a week.One of the key reasons kids say they don't read more often is that they have trouble finding books they like - a requirement that parents underestimate .
The study also finds that parents have a strong influence on kids' reading, but only about half of all parents begin reading to their kids before their first birthday.The percent of children who are read to every day drops from 38 percent among five-to eight-year-olds to 23 percent among nine-to 11-year-olds - exactly the same time that kids' daily reading for fun starts to drop.
""Parents' engagement in their child's reading from birth all the way through the teen years can have a great influence on how often their children read and how much they enjoy reading,"" adds Carter.",high11827.txt
