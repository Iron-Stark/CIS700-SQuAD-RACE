2,A,"['thought it was not fair to boys', 'did not like having children at work', 'did not have daughters to take to work', 'would rather have their daughters stay at home']",TOD was criticized because some people   _  .,"April 22,2010 will be the 18th celebration of the annual Take Our Daugluers to Work Day (TOD), a project the National Ms.Foundation for Women of America (NFW) developed to expose girls to expanding opportunities for women in the workplace.
The program offers, millions of girls a first - hand view of the many career opportunities available in their futures.Now that women make up 46 peroent of the U.S.workforce, girls can find role models in every occupational field-from politics to molecular biology to professional athletics, to name just a few.TOD encourages girls to focus on their abilities and opportunities, not just their appearance.
The NFW developed the project more than a decade ago to address the self - esteem problems that many girls experience when they enter adolescence.At school, boys often receive more encouragement in the classroom, especially in math.science and computer science, the academic fields that tend to lead to the highest salaries.Women receive on average only 73 cents for every dollar that men are paid.and remain vastly underrepresented   in top executive positions and technology fields.TOD aims to give girls the confidence and inspiration they need to develop successful careers, particularly in non-traditional fields.
Perhaps because the program had become so widespread and successful, TOD had been criticized for excluding boys.and it was expanded in 2003to include boys.The program's official website states that the program was changed in order to provide both boys and girls with opportunities to explore careers at an age when they are more flexible in tenns of gender stereotyped roles.""We should also show boys that becoming a child care provider is as acceptable a choice as becoming a police officer or CEO,"" added Sara K.Gould.executive director of the NFW.",high8519.txt
