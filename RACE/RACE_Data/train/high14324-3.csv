3,C,"['Which proves to be the better way to live, right-handed or left-handed?', 'How do left-handed people differ from right-handed ones?', 'Why are some people left-handed?', 'Are left-handed people equally treated in society?']",What's the best title for the passage?,"According to a survey, only 4% of the people in the world are left-handed. Why? One theory centers on the two halves of the brain. For example, the left half and the right half, each of which functions differently. Medical science believes that the left half of the brain dominates over the right half. The foundation of this theory is the fact that nerves from the brain cross over at neck-level to the opposite side of the body, and nerves from the other side of the brain reciprocate  . The end result is that the opposite sides of the body are controlled by the opposite sides of the brain.
The dominant left half of the brain, which kindly supplies the right half of the body, theoretically makes it more skillful in reading, writing, speaking, and working, and makes most people right-handed. Lefties, however, whose right half of the brain dominates, work best with the left side of their bodies.
Theory number two focuses on the _ nature of the body. Examples of the asymmetry, which flows from head to toe, are that the right side of our faces differs slightly from the left, that our legs differ in strength, or that our feet vary in size. One aspect of this asymmetry is that for most people the right hand is stronger than the left.
There is no doubt that all exist in a ""right-handed society"", which produces most basics, including scissors, doorknobs, locks, screwdrivers, automobiles, buttons on clothing, and musical instruments for the 96%. Left-handed people make up for the unfairness by being members of an elite   society, which includes many of the greatest geniuses, including Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci.",high14324.txt
