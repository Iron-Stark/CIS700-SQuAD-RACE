3,B,"['Sure. She likes it very much.', ""It's hard to say if she likes it."", ""No, she doesn't like it at all."", ""It's easy for her to answer this question""]",Does Susan really like her school life?,"My name is Susan. I am a junior high school student. I like my school and my friends. I like my school because we have good teachers. They teach us many things.
But then, I don't understand   lots of things about school. I don't understand why we have to take so many tests  . I have to take a heavy school bag with many books in it. I may have a test anytime. I don't like taking tests all the time.
I wonder if I like my school life. It is hard for me to answer this kind of question. On one hand   I am not happy because there are so many tests in the school; on the other hand I am happy because I can learn a lot and I can make good friends in school.
