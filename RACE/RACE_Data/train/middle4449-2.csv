2,C,"[""It wasn't so bad as the author said."", 'It was delicious.', ""It couldn't be worse."", 'It was as good as her cook did.']",What did the author's mother think of her lunch soup after she tasted it?,"We were standing at the top of a church tower. My father had brought me to this spot in a small town not far from our home in Rome. I wondered why.
""Look down, Elsa,"" Father said. I gathered all my courage and looked down. I saw the square in the center of the village, And I saw the criss-cross  of streets leading to the square. ""See, my dear,"" Father said gently, ""There is more than one way to the square. Life is like that. If you can't get to the place where you want to go by one road. try another.""
Now I understood why I was there, Earlier that day I had begged my mother to do something about the awful lunches that were served at school. But she refused because she didn't believe the lunches were as bad as I said.
When I turned to Father for help, he would not interfere . Instead, he brought me to this high tower to give me a lesson. By the time we reached home, I had a plan.
At school the next day, I secretly poured my lunch soup into a bottle and brought it home. Then I asked our cook to serve it to Mother at dinner. _ She swallowed one spoonful and sputtered, ""The cook must have gone bad!"" Quickly I told what I had done, and Mother stated firmly that she would deal with the matter of lunches at school the next day!
In the following years I often remembered the lesson Father taught me. I began to work as a fashion designer two years ago. I wouldn't stop working until I tried every possible means to my goal. Father's wise words always remind me that there is more than one way to the square,",middle4449.txt
