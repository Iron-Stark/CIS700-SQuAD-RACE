He patrolled   the spring every day, and swept away all the leaves and other things that would dirty the fresh flow of water. Soon, beautiful swans   came to the clear spring, and the village became a popular attraction for visitors.
Years passed. One evening the town leaders held a meeting. As they looked at the salary list, one of them said, ""Why do we keep this old man on year after year? I don't think we need him or his work."" Later, the old man was asked to leave.

Only a few months after the old man left, all the swans left, as did the tourists. Disease reached deeply into the village.
