2,A,"['a replaceable filter', 'the Kinect device', 'Wii system', 'Fruit Ninja']","In order to use eyes to operate their mobile phones, most users should buy   _  .","In the near future, we may be using our eyes to operate our smartphones and tablets, even when it comes to playing popular games like Fruit Ninja.
The GazeGroup has been developing eye-controlled computer technology   for nearly 20 years. But those devices   have been mainly designed to aid those with disabilities, and are very expensive.
""After a while, we figured out that probably the best way is to go for a mass-market approach,"" says Gaze's Sune Alstrup Johansen, ""where everybody would have this available.""
Johansen and some of his colleagues have formed a new company, The Eye Tribe, which is hoping to develop the technology on a mass commercial level.
The technology works by sending an infrared   light from the computing device toward the user's face. After measuring the user's eye movements, the technology is then able to easily know where a person's eyes are moving, allowing the eyes to control a cursor  .
A software can determine the location of the eyes and tell where the user is looking on the screen. It even knows which image he is looking at.
There has been a gradual change toward hands-free technology in recent years, particularly in the gaming world. Following Nintendo's popular Wii system, Xbox released the Kinect device, which lets users control their Xbox and play certain games using only their hands, legs and voices. 
Since most smartphones and other mobile devices can't come standard with an infrared device, Johansen said a replaceable filter   would be an inexpensive, convenient choice for most consumers.
And even as companies like The Eye Tribe work to create a commercially practical product for the average user, making the eye-controlled technology more accessible and less expensive will have similar benefits for disabled users.
""Then I can go to any computer, and then I can control it and I can use it, instead of just bringing my own,"" said Stig Langvad, who heads up Denmark's umbrella organization for people with disabilities. ""So I'll be a part of society on an equal foot, instead of being a special solution.""",high17593.txt
