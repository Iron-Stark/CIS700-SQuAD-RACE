0,D,"['The children are so clever that we need not worry about their study.', 'Someone else can take care of the children and our late life.', 'We are rich enough to afford all the money that the children spend.', ""We needn't worry about the children and our late life.""]",What is the fourth advice meant to tell us?,"We can't help but grow older physically, but we can stay young in other ways. Do you want to stay young? If yes is the answer, here is what you can do:
1. _ . This includes age, weight and height. Let the doctor worry about them. That is why you pay him/her.
2. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches  pull you down.
3. Keep learning. Learn more about the computer, gardening, whatever. Never let the brain idle. ""An idle mind is the devil's workshop.""
4.Enjoy the simple things. When the children are young, that is all that you can afford. When they are in college, that is all you can afford. When you are on retirement, that is all you can afford!
5. Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath. Laugh so much that you can be tracked in the store by your distinctive laughter.
6. Surround yourself with what you love, whether it is family, pets, keepsakes, music, plants, or hobbies, whatever. Your home is your refuge.
7. Value your health. If it is good, preserve it. If it is unstable, improve it. If it is beyond what you can improve, get help.
8. The tears happen. Endure sorrow, and move on. The only person who is with us our entire life, is ourselves. Be alive while you are alive.
9. At every opportunity, tell the people you love that you love them.",high72.txt
