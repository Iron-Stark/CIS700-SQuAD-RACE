3,A,"['A Positive Disabled Boy--Luka', 'The Tough Life of Luka', 'A Dream of Being a Photographer', 'Ways of Photographing the Disabled']",What's the best title of the passage?,"A lot of kids have dreams they'll never achieve due to the limitations of their little bodies. They want to fly, or to become a dinosaur, or to learn how to act like Spiderman.
Luka Tavcar, 12, has muscular dystrophy   and is totally dependent on his wheelchair. Nevertheless, late last year, he had an inspired plan: to be photographed walking around and having fun.
He approached Matej Peljhan, an amateur photographer and a psychologist at CIRIUS rehabilitation   center near Ljubljana, Slovenia, where Luka is a patient.
At first, Peljhan was perplexed. How could he photograph a boy who can not move or act in motion? ""Luka wanted to see himself playing and having fun, but it seemed impossible,"" he says.
Then Peljhan had a brainstorm: Luka could lie down on a piece of cloth and, with the help of an assistant, Peljhan would pose the boy as if he were jumping, climbing stairs, moving downhill on a skateboard, and playing basketball. Then Peljhan would shoot these images from above. The photos took about a month to produce; all were shot early this year.
Peljhan, who lost his right arm and left eye as a child, says his own disabilities motivated him to make the photographs. ""I understand people with limitations,"" he says.
He named the series ""The Little Prince"" after the French story by Antoine de Saint-Exupery in which a boy teaches a man about trust, hope, and friendship. Luka loves the photos.
Matej himself understands what it is like to live with limitations--he lost his right arm and left eye as a child.""Luka wants to stay positive and his imagination helps him forget his physical limitation,"" says Peljhan. ""He's fragile, but he can see the world differently.""",high19297.txt
