4,D,"['Amy has probably just received an operation  on liver.', 'Amy is now probably in hospital recovering.', 'A Chinese man donated part of his liver to Amy', 'Amy is now still taking medicine to lose weight.']",Which of the following is NOT true?,"Dear Amy,
I couldn't read your two e-mails until today because my computer was broken. I'm so sorry to hear about your problem, but I'm glad you're feeling better and are recovering . I'm surprised that in China someone's liver  matched  yours! This is really a moving story--a stranger donated part of his liver to _ he doesn't even know!
You're right. We shouldn't care too much about our weight. I'm happy you stopped taking medicine to lose weight. From your photo I can see you are now looking very well in the hospital. To keep slim  is important, especially for an actress, but nothing is more important than health. Your doctor's advice is really very good--exercise for at least half an hour every day and eat lots of fruit and vegetables.
It's not only in your country. It's the same here with us Chinese--many people are always taking medicine to lose weight. That is often dangerous. But in fact, some of them are not overweight  at all. I hope these people can learn something from your story. Hope you will leave hospital as soon as possible.
Love
