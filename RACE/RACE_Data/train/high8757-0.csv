But have you ever wondered why those things make you uncomfortable?
It's all about personal peace, which means not only an imaginary space around the body, but also the space around all the senses. People feel that their space is being violated   when they meet with an unwelcome sound, smell or look. This is probably why a man on a crowded bus shouting into his mobile phone or a woman next to you putting on strong perfume   makes you feel angry.
Whether people have had a stronger wish to protect their personal space in recent times is hard to say. Yet studies of airlines show that people have a strong desire   to have space to themselves. In a survey  by Trip Advisor, a travel website, people said that if they had to pay more for some extra service, they would rather have larger seats than extra food.
