2,D,"['Rubens created his works by working with his students.', 'A beautiful garden was added to the Rubens House by new owners.', 'The Rubens House is decorated with furniture of the 17th century.', ""Today's Rubens House looks like its original structure.""]","Which of the following is TRUE, according to the text?","Many famous painters worked in Antwerp during the city's period of greatest power but Peter Paul Rubens is undoubtedly the most famous one of them. Known as Rubens House, the palace-like residence  and studio where Rubens worked and lived from 1616 until his death in 1640 is now one of Antwerp's most visited museums.
Almost all of the works Rubens and his students created in the Rubens House have been dispersed   over major museums across the whole world, but there is still an impressive collection well worth the visit. Besides paintings form the master himself you will find other works of art and furniture of the 17th century as well as paintings from his students, including works by Jacob Jordaens and Anthony Van Dyck.
The Rubens House was not only a studio but also a meeting place for the rich and famous. His clients  included wealthy merchants, diplomats, and there were also many noblemen who often visited his studio to see how work progressed. The Rubens House even had a special viewing area which allowed visitors to see the artists at work.
Ruben bought the house at the beginning of the 17th century after his eight-year-long stay in Italy. Influenced by Italian architecture, he rebuilt the building into an Italian-styled palace with a beautiful garden and moved in the house in1616.
After his death the building was sold. New owners modified the building greatly and by 1937, when the building was purchased by the city of Antwerp, it hardly resembled the original structure.
The impressive entrance hall, which connected the studio and the residence, is one of the few parts that survived. Other parts have been carefully restored and reconstructed after original plans and paintings of the house.",high11434.txt
