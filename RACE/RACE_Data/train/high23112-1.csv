1,A,"['he was familiar with the road', 'he was good at driving', ""his hands didn't have sweat"", 'the weather was fine']",Andersen didn't expect any trouble on the road because  _  .,"The 30 miles of steep roads that snake through the mountains of Logan Canyon in Utah are enough to make most drivers'hands sweat. But Andersen, a 46-year-old father of four, wasn't expecting any trouble on the road last New Year's Eve, when he set off for a ski trip to the Bear River Mountains with nine-year-old daughter Mia, four-old son Baylor, and nine-year-old neighbor Kenya.
