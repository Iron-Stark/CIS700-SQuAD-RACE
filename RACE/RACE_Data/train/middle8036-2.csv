2,C,"['Unfriendly.', 'Boring.', 'Independent.', 'Lazy.']",Can you use a word to describe the writer?,"I'm 14, a year younger than most of my classmates.
A week ago one of my classmates, Nitin, asked me for help with math homework. We ended up talking about computers and file-sharing . As we talked I found that he was more experienced and could teach me about file-sharing and networking. We went to his room and watched a movie about robots that he'd downloaded. The math homework was forgotten.
The next day he came again for homework help ""What do you do on weekends?"" he asked. The truth is, when I have work to do, I do it. I have no special time to
with friends. I was embarrassed about this. I expected him to think I was boring and said, ""Get a life!"" He said, ""OK. You're having trouble getting along with people I can show you. I'm old than you.""
Later, he checked my computer. He even connected me to an Internet chess server .He was becoming like a big brother.
But when I thought about it, I didn't really want Nitin's help"" His big-brother idea began to bore me.
""I'll get you some cool computer programs "".
""I'll teach you how to talk to girls.""
He meant what he was saying, but I don't know why it didn't make me feel good. Since then he's hardly talked to me; we seem to have forgotten each other. I don't think he can ""teach"" me much, and I don't think much of him. But I could be wrong*",middle8036.txt
