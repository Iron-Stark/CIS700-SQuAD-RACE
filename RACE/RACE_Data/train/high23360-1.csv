1,D,"['Tall people earn more than their shorter counterparts.', 'Prenatal care and prenatal nutrition are less important than we already know.', 'The reason for lower pay for shorter people is social discrimination.', 'Taller children perform significantly better on cognitive test.']",What can we learn from the study of Anne Case and Christina Paxson?,"While researchers have long shown that tall people earn more than their shorter counterparts, it's not only social discrimination that accounts for this inequality but tall people are just smarter than their height-challenged peers, a new study finds.
    ""As early as age three, before schooling a child has had a chance to play a role, and throughout childhood, taller children perform significantly better on cognitive tests,"" wrote Anne Case and Christina Paxson ofprefix = st1 /PrincetonUniversityin a paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
    The findings were based primarily on two British studies that followed children born in 1958 and 1970, respectively, through adulthood and aU.S.study on height and occupational choice.
    Other studies have pointed to low self-esteem, better health that accompanies greater height, and social discrimination as criminals for lower pay for shorter people.
    But researchers Case and Paxson believe the height advantage in the job world is more than just a question of image.
    ""As adults, taller individuals are more likely to be selected into higher paying occupations that require more advanced verbal   and numerical skills and greater intelligence, for which they earn handsome returns,"" they wrote.
    But the researchers said the differences in performance _ long before the tall people enter the job force. Prenatal   care and the time between birth and the age of 3 are critical periods for determining future cognitive ability and height.
    ""Prenatal care and prenatal nutrition are just incredibly important, even more so than we already knew,"" Case said in an interview.",high23360.txt
