How to manage your Time:
Value Your Own Situation. The first step is to know yourself. People work differently. Some people are very active in the early morning and can carry out much at that time. Others find that their most powerful time is later in the day.
Get Organized. Make a shopping list or make some type of planned notebook. This may seem simple but you would be surprised how many people do not use these necessary things.

A="" Most"" important goal that needs to be completed very soon
B="" Next"" important goal that does not have immediate necessity
C="" Finally,"" do all other things.
Plan Your Time. Fill in any spaces purposely left blank, and block out time to sleep. Be realistic, most college students don't go to bed at 9 pm. Choose time for recreation each day.
Plan Study Time. Students should study 2-3 hours for every unit, for a total of 25-35 hours per week.
Time management is a system of learning to give first concern to the tasks you wish to complete. The key to being a good time manager is to learn to make full use of discretionary time and try to use it successfully.",middle2902.txt
