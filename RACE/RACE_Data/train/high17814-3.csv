3,D,"['In 1996, Honda was so famous that it was hard to buy one in Europe.', 'If the dealer mails you with a cut rate offer, you should accept it but without any charge.', 'At last, the writer paid $1,200 for the car he liked.', 'It was with the fourth dealer that the writer made a successful deal.']",Which of the following statement is TRUE according to the text?,"In 1996 I wanted to buy a Honda Civic. I went to the local dealer. ""Oh, you want a Civic, do you?"" said the fellow. ""And I suppose you'd also like us to throw in a couple of front-row Superbowl tickets? Haw! Haw! Haw! Haw!""
When his laughter ended, he explained that the Civic was such a hit in Europe that Honda was getting an extra $ 2,000 per car there, making Civic practically unavailable in the States. But he did offer to let me add my name to the waiting list--if I agreed to pay $1,000 over the sticker   price.
When Honda dealerships No. 2 and No. 3 gave me the same story, I was ready to try anything. I carefully looked over to www.autobytel.com. For a  _ like me, Auto-By-Tel's scheme   is nearly irresistible. You indicate the car you want to buy, compete with the freedom to choose. The nearest participating car dealer mails you back with a cut rate offer. There's no charge for any of this -- and no obligation to accept the offer. It surely seemed no less to me.
Sure enough, two days later, a dealer 30 minutes away wrote me. ""Unfortunately, 96 Civics are in very short supply,"" his message said, ""The best we can offer you is $1,200 under sticker price. ""I was in happiness. Ah! Bliss! Ah, saving! Ah, revenge!
When I picked up the car, it got better. Since there was no haggling  , the dealership fellow was friendly and congratulatory instead of everything. Now this, I thought, is the way to buy a car. 
     Auto-By-Tel makes money by charging a fee to each participating dealer. The dealers make money by receiving hundreds of ready-to-buy customer names off the Web. And you save money because your price doesn't reflect advertising, test drives, sales commissions, and so on.
My only regret is that I didn't think up Auto-By-Tel first.",high17814.txt
