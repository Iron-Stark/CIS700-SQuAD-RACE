is Japanese Children's Day. In fact, it is usually called Boy's Day because it is mainly celebrated (  ) by boys. The celebration of Boy's Day has a long history. It is said that the festival comes from the Dragon Boat Festival in China.
On Boy's Day, Japanese boys eat a special kind of rice cake. It is covered with a leaf and filled with bean paste (   ). Children love to eat it very much.
On this day, children don't have to go to school. Each family with a boy hangs up huge carp-shaped flag (   ). The flags are usually three colors: black, red and blue. Black stands for the father, red stands for the mother and blue stands for the son. Japanese parents believe that the flags will bring their boys good luck and give them courage and power.",middle8128.txt
