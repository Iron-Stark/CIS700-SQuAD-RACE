My eyes followed the circling dirt out to the road and down toward the school bus stop. I was going to miss walking down the road to catch the big school bus that took us into town to school. I enjoyed being with the teachers and the  other  students.  Now  that  I  was  finished  with  school  I  seemed  to  have  lost  some  of  the excitement from my life.
As  I was  folding  the  canvas chair, Chatita Chavez drove  into our yard  in her  father's old truck.  It made short loud sounds and sent out a trail of black smoke out of its tailpipe. She got out smiling as usual and excitedly pointed toward the storm that seemed to be moving toward us.
""I can't stay long, Nilda. There's a storm coming and I need to beat it home."" I was glad to see her. ""Yes, I think we're in for some bad weather. Come on in and have a cup of coffee at least,"" I said as I took her into our kitchen.
""I'm so excited, Nilda! You'll never guess what I just did!""  I stopped pouring the coffee and turned and looked at her.
""I just went over to Edinburg and registered for junior college,"" she said and looked at me and smiled. ""Don't you want to go take classes with me?""
I was astonished. I didn't know what to say. How could I go to college?  I didn't have any money.  I  gave  Chatita  a  cup  of  coffee.  ""I  don't  know.  I  don't  think  I  can.  Isn't  college expensive?""
Chatita  sat down  at  the  table  and began  adding  sugar  to her  coffee.  ""Not  really,  and I'm working part-time at the packing shed on Canal Road. You could work there, too.""
The wind  began  to  gust  causing  the  house  to  occasionally make  sounds  and  shake.  The lightbulb  hanging  over  the  table  flashed  off  and  on  and  I  heard  a  low  roll  of  thunder  in  the distance.
I hesitantly asked, ""Do you think I could get a job at the packing shed?""
""Sure. My cousin is the boss. He'll give you a job."" Mama  came  into  the  kitchen  and  exchanged  greetings with Chatita. She must have heard our conversation.
""I  think  it's  nice  that  you're  going  to  go  to  college, Chatita. What will  you  study?"" my
mother asked as she joined us at the table.
""I want to be a teacher.""
""A teacher! How nice!"" Mama said as she patted Chatita's arm.
""A teacher?"" I asked. ""Don't you need a degree?""
""You can start teaching before you get your degree. Clarence Duncan has been teaching in Brownsville since last year and I think Zulema will start this year.""
The lightbulb blinked again and went out. Mama quickly arose from the table. ""I'm going to have to bring in the lanterns. I knew I shouldn't have packed them away.""
""Well, Nilda, do you want to go? Because, if you do, you can go over to Edinburg with me tomorrow.""
I hesitated, then said, ""Yes. I want to go."" My heart was beating fast. I couldn't believe how happy I was feeling.
""But I have to talk to Mama and Papa. What if they won't let me?""
""You can at least go with me tomorrow and find out what it's all about. I'll come by for you around eight.""
Chatita left me sitting at the table staring at my cup of coffee. It seemed so unreal, this idea of me going to college. My parents had never had the opportunity for much education. Juana had quit school  to get married and Roberto and Zeke had graduated from high school as I had. But college? I would be the first one in my family to go to college. Yes, college was exactly what I wanted.
The day had  turned dark and  the  rain had started. My mother  came back  into  the kitchen with two lanterns.
""Mama, I need to ask you something.""
She picked up a cloth and began to clean the dust from the lanterns. She looked at me and smiled.
""Mama,  if  I  could  find  a way  to pay,  could  I  take  classes  at  the  junior  college?""  I  asked, trying to control my excitement.
She stopped cleaning and raised her eyebrows. ""What would you study, my daughter?""
""I think I want to be a teacher,"" I quietly replied.
Mama sat down at the table across from me. ""Then, I would like for you to go to college,"" she said in a serious tone.
""What about Papa? Do you think he will allow me to go?""
""Your  father wants  you  to  be  happy.  If  going  to  college  and  being  a  teacher makes  you happy, then he will probably allow it,"" she answered.
I didn't say anything. I was enjoying the feeling of happiness and sense of wonder that had come over me. The two of us sat in the darkened room without speaking until  I saw my mama rubbing her eyes with the edge of her apron.
""What's wrong, Mama.""
""Nothing,"" she replied. ""I probably got some dust in my eyes. That's all.""",high9925.txt
