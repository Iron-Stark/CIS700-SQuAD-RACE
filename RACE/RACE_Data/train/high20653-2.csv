2,B,"[""They don't believe in fairy tales."", ""They don't believe in the transformational qualities of love."", 'They have also experienced abuse.', 'They survived abuse.']",Which of the following statements is true of the women in a control group?,"Warning: reading too much Cinderella  to your daughter may damage her emotional health in later life. A paper to be developed at the international congress of cognitive psychotherapy  in Gothenburg suggests a link between the attitudes of women abused  by their parents and early exposure to the wrong sort of fairy tales. It says girls who identified with Cinderella, Rapunzel  and Beauty in Beauty and the Beast were more likely to stay in destructive relationships as adults.
The theory was developed by Susan Darker Smith, a psychotherapist at the University of Derby. She interviewed 67 female abuse survivors and found that 61 put up with severe abuse because they believed they could change their partners with patience, composition and love. The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. Hardly any of the women in a control group, who had not experienced abuse, thought they could change their partners in this way.
    The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. These women and men said they would leave a relationship rather than put up with abuse from a partner. Ms Darker Smith found the abused women were much more likely to identify with Cinderella and other _ female characters in fairytales, who were later rescued by a stranger prince or hero.
Although most girls heard the stories, damage appeared to be done to those who adopted the characters as role models. ""They believe if their love is strong enough they can change their parents' behaviors,"" she said."" Overexposure in children to stories that emphasize the transformational qualities of love may make women believe they can change their partners."" For example, they might never have understood the obvious flaw in the story of Rapunzel, who remained locked in a high tower until rescued by a knight on a white horse, who broke the door down. ""The question,"" said Ms Darker Smith, ""is why she did not break the door down herself.""",high20653.txt
