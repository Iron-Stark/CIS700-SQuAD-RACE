1,A,"['glad', 'sorry', 'afraid', 'upset']",. The dog was very    _    when his master came back from hunting.,"More than seven hundred years ago, the Prince of Wales had a very big and brave dog called Gelert.
One day the Prince wanted to go hunting with his men. He told his dog to stay at home and look after his baby son. The baby was in a small wooden bed.
When the Prince came back from hunting, Gelert ran out to meet him. He wagged his tail and jumped up to put his paws on the Prince's chest. Then the Prince saw the blood on his head. He rushed into his house and found the bed lying on its side on the floor. The clothes were torn and there was blood on them.
The prince thought the dog had killed his son and took out his sword, killing the dog. Just as Gelert was dying, he managed to bark. Then the Prince heard a baby call to the dog. The Prince ran out of the house and saw his son lying on the ground unhurt. Near him was a dead wolf.
The Prince ran back into the house but it was too late. Gelert was dead. The Prince was very sad indeed. Tears ran down his face when he realized he had killed his
friend. The Prince carried the body of his brave dog to the top of a mountain and buried him there. After this, the Prince never smiled again.
If you go to Mount Snowdon in Wales, people will show you where Gelert is buried. There is a sign by his grave. It reminds people of a brave and faithful dog.",middle8164.txt
