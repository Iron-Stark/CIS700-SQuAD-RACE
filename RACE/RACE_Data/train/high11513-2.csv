2,C,"['Try to notice every passer-by.', 'Umbrellas are important.', 'Always be prepared.', 'Weather changes unexpectedly.']",What's the most suitable title for the passage?,"When I was having a walk through the park today, I met a friend I hadn't seen for ages. She stared at me curiously. ""You have kept this umbrella for years; it's old and out of date. I wonder why you keep it and take it wherever you go."" I smiled, ""it means a great deal to me."" I simply gave her my shortest answer. Honestly speaking, I, either, could not understand the reason why I kept it.
Then all of a sudden, fallen leaves darkened my eyes with a strong wind. I grabbed the umbrella instinctively. The rain poured down. Thanks to my umbrella, I didn't get wet at all.
""Why have I kept it for so long?"" I asked myself, staring at my umbrella. I couldn't remember when and where I bought it, for I'm always tired and lazy to answer questions. It could protect me from the heavy rain, I told myself eventually. Looking at the people rushing through the street, I felt safe. This might be another reason.
It is always so. We know a thunderstorm comes unexpectedly and goes without a warning. The sky cleared up. The sun shone brightly. Just as usual, I seized the umbrella with my left hand. Still there's water dropping down. I walked among the noisy crowd and listened to what they were murmuring in their heart. ""Today I will ask for a rise, or I'll leave this company."" Good luck to you, I smiled to him. ""I'll manage to make you live forever."" A little boy held a pet dog close to him. ""She'll be all right, because she is blessed."" I heard angels singing in this city.
The moment my fingertips touched the umbrella, I felt it's dry, and it's warm. Soon it became hot. I held it up to avoid harmful sunshine. Do I need a reason to explain why? Maybe I should think about it. I need my umbrella when it is sunny as well as when it is rainy.",high11513.txt
