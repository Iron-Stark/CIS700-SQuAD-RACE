1,B,"['Because he offered others meth.', 'Because he took drugs.', 'Because he refused the company.', ""Because he didn't pay for his phone.""]",Why was the writer put into prison?,"I love music. I learned to play the guitar at 11 and I wrote my first song four years later. My dream -----to become a country singer.
After years of hard work, a record company was showing interest in me. One day during a trip to mountains, a friend gave me a bit of meth, a kind of drugs . I smoked it. And that was all that I thought about for the next year and a half. I couldn't live without it.
When the police came to me, I looked like death. The first seven days in prison , I just slept. When I woke up on the eighth day, I had never known such shame and guilt . I walked down the hall to the pay phone. My mama is the best person on the earth, and I knew this was going to break her heart. When I heard her voice on the phone, I told her where I was. She just said, ""Son, no matter what you did, I love you forever .
Her words gave me the confidence to face my trouble . And I also realized  this was my chance to start a new life.
When people hear my words, I hope they will not make the same mistake  as I have, but I know that you can overcome  almost anything, especially smoking drug. That's why I share my story here.",middle2824.txt
