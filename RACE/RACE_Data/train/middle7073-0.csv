0,B,"['He fell into a river.', 'He was washed up on an island.', 'He lives on a small island.', 'He was free.']",What happened to Tom?,"Tom was the only person alive after a shipwreck, the sea water washed up on a small island.There was nobody on the island,Tom hoped someone could come to save him,and every day he looked at the sea,but he didn't see any ship.
A few days later,Tom built a little hut for himself.But then one day, after looking for food,he arrived home and found his little hut was on fire.The smoke went up to the sky,the worst thing happened,everything was lost,Tom was so sad and angry.He cried.Early next day,however,the sound of a ship woke him up.The ship was coming close to the island.It came to save him!
""How did you know I was here?""Tom asked the men from the ship.
""We saw your smoke,""they answered.
It is easy to get sad when things are going bad,but we shouldn't lose hope.Remember,next time little hut is on fire and we lost everything,maybe the smoke is calling for help for us.For all the bad things happen to us,life has good answers for them.",middle7073.txt
