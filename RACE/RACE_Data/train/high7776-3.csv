3,C,"['We should clean the banks of our rivers.', 'We should know what will happen in the future.', 'We should know what we should do and do it now.', 'We should plant more trees and flowers.']",What is the most important thing for us to do to save our world?,"1970 was ""World Conservation Year"". The United Nations wanted everyone to know that the world was in danger. They hoped that the governments would act quickly in order to conserve nature. Here is one example of the problem. At one time there were 1300 different plants, trees and flowers in Holland, but now only 860 remain. The others have been destroyed by modern man and his technology. We are changing the earth, the air and the water, and everything that grows and lives. We can't live without these things. If we continue like this, we shall destroy ourselves.
What will happen in the future? Perhaps it is more important to ask ""What must we do now?"" The people who will be living in the world of tomorrow are the young of today. A lot of them know that conservation is necessary. Many are hoping to save our world. They plant trees, build bridges across rivers in forests and so on. In a small town in the United States a large group of girls cleaned the banks of eleven kilometres of their river. Young people may hear about conservation through a record called ""No, One's Going to Change our World. "" It was made by Scatles, Cliff Richard and other singers. The money from it will help to conserve wild animals.",high7776.txt
