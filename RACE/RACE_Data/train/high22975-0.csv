0,C,"['think of money', 'look at each other', 'pay attention to it', 'stop crossing the street']",The sound of a coin dropping makes people_.,"A few minutes ago , walking back from lunch , I started to cross the street when I heard the sound of a coin dropping . It wasn't much but , as I turned , my eyes caught the heads of several other people turning too . A woman had dropped what appeared to be a dime . 
The tinkling sound of a coin dropping on sidewalk is an attention-getter . It can be nothing more than a penny . Whatever the coin is , no one ignores the sound of it . It got me thinking about sounds again .
We are surrounded by so many sounds that attract the most attention . People in prefix = st1 /New York Cityseldom turn to look when a fire engine, a police car or an ambulance comes screaming along the street .
When I'm in New York, I'm a New Yorker . I don't turn either . Like the natives . I hardly hear a siren   there .
At home in my little town in Connecticut, it's different . The distant loud noise of a police car , an emergency vehicle or a fire siren brings me to my feet if I'm seated and brings me to the window if I'm in bed .
It's the quietest sounds that have most effect on us , not the loudest . In the middle of the night , I can hear a dripping tap a hundred yards away through three closed doors . I've been hearing little creaking noises and sounds which my imagination turns into footsteps in the middle of the night for twenty-five years in our house . How come I never hear those sounds in the daytime ?
I'm quite clear in my mind what the good sounds are and what the bad sounds are .
I've turned against whistling , for instance . I used to think of it as the mark of a happy worker but lately I've been connecting the whistler with a nervous person making noises .
The tapping , tapping ,tapping of my typewriter as the keys hit the paper is a lovely sound to me .  I often like the sound of what I write better than the looks of it .",high22975.txt
