1,D,"['Because there was a broken window.', 'Because they were afraid of death.', 'Because they made the accident happen.', 'Because it was difficult for them to enter the car.']",Why did the other two men not go to save the baby?,"A young man named Matt Vongsykeo, 14-year-old, has saved a baby from the wreckage   of a car. The four-month-old baby boy, found hanging in his capsule   when Vongsykeo climbed into the car in Melbourne's Springvale, escaped serious injury and was taken to hospital.
         But the child's 33-year-old mother, from Endeavour Hills, died in hospital following last night's high speed crash, which left three other people injured.
         A car on the wrong side of the road is thought to have been traveling at over 100 kph  when it hit three other vehicles. Vongsykeo said he heard the crash from his house and found a  _ rushed against a wall. He heard a baby crying.
         ""There were two adults standing outside the car and they couldn't get in, so I had to climbed in and get the baby out,"" he said. ""I had to do it quickly because there was a window below me and I was afraid that was going to break.""
         Vongsykeo told how he took out the baby in his arms and called to see if there was anyone else in the car. He found the baby's mother unconscious  .
         ""I thought she was dead so I just rushed out."" he said. ""She entered consciousness later on and I went around and started talking to her and getting her to talk to me and stay with me.""
         He said he comforted the mother and told her baby was safe.
         Vongsykeo refused the idea that he was a hero.
         ""I've lived for 14 years. If something had happened to me ... I've lived for 14 years. That baby hasn't and I wanted to give him a chance.""",high22948.txt
