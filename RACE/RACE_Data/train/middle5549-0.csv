0,D,"['north American', 'south Asian', 'north Asian', 'south American']",Most of the hummingbirds live in a(n)   _   forest.,"If you are lucky enough, you may find the hummingbird  , the smallest bird of the animal world, in a south American forest.
Though the hummingbird is no bigger than a bee and weighs only 2 to 3 grams, it can fly as fast as 50 meters in a second. It can fly forwards   as most birds do, and it can fly backwards as well. The strangest thing about it, however, is that it can stay still in the air, just like a _ .
Whenever a hummingbird needs food, it will fly slowly towards a flower. It won't stand on the flower, as bees do, but just hangs to the flower and then begins to sunk   the honey from inside the flower with its needle-like beak.
The hummingbird is very particular in building its nest  . It takes great trouble to choose materials. It likes soft ones better than hard ones. Its eggs are so small that a common match box can hold as many as one hundred of them.",middle5549.txt
