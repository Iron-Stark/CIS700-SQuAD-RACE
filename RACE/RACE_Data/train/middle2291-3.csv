3,C,"['the road is not noisy', 'the road is very clean', 'there is no car or bus running', 'you can see very clearly on the road']","""The road is clear"" means that   _  .","Every year several thousand people die in the car accidents in Great Britain. And between one and two hundred thousand people are hurt.
There are rules to make the roads safe, but people do not always obey   the rules. They are careless. If everybody obeys the rules, the road will be much safer. How can we make the roads safer?
Remember this rule. In Great Britain traffic keeps to the left. Cars, buses and bikes must all keep to the left side of the road. In most other countries traffic keeps to the right.
Before crossing the road, we should stop and look at both ways. Look right and left. Then, if you are sure that the road is clear, it is safe to cross the road. If you see small children or very old people, help them to cross the road. We must teach our children to cross the road safely. We must always give them a good example. Small children must not play in the street.",middle2291.txt
