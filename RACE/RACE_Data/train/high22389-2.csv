The leader of the Indian independence movement was Mohandas Gandhi. He was born into a Hindu family. As a young man, Gandhi studied law in London. The Hindu leaders had threatened to punish him. But he went to London anyhow.
Gandhi believed in fighting without weapons or force. He called his method non-violence . He would simply disobey any unfair law or policy. He was willing to be punished for his actions. Gandhi thought that the law would be changed if enough people protested   in this way. It would show how strongly the people felt about his beliefs.
Gandhi wanted all Indians to understand the independence movement. He walked barefoot through the villages, speaking to all people. Many people loved and understood Gandhi. His movement grew. The British flag came down in 1947.
