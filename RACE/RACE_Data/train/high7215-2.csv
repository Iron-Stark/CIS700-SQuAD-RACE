Yes, you can earn money online without any investment or without anytime limit. There is no need to stop any other work. Here I tell you the complete method for online earning.
The Method
You can earn money through ""Bux.to"" by clicking on ads on ""Bux. to"" site. First you need to open an account at ""Bux. to"". ""Bux. to"" is a new international and FREE English based service that allows advertisers to reach thousands of potential customers by displaying their ads on our ""Surf Ads"" page. An exact calculated percentage of all advertising income is paid to our members. ""Bux. to"" makes money through advertising.
How you make money
You view websites in 30 seconds through the ""Surf Ads"" page. Once the 30 seconds is up, you'll either get a green tick sign or a red ""x"". The green tick sign means you've earned $0.01and the ""x"" means you have not earned money for the visit. You'll get red x's when you have more than one website from the ""Surf Ads"" page open. When this happens, you get no credit.
