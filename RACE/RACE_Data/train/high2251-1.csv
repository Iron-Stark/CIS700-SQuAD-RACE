1,D,"['whether she could do well at school', 'when she could have sleepovers', 'what should be written in the book', 'how long she practiced the violin']",Lulu quarreled with her mother mainly over  _  .,"Has Tiger Mom gone soft? One year after the release of her book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, Amy Chua is back in the spotlight, reflecting on how overnight infamy   affected her life, her family and her parenting.
""I have changed a lot,"" she told the Huffington Post. ""In October, we had 30 kids at our house! We have hosted parties with lots of food and music.""
Last January, the Wall Street Journal published an excerpt   from Chua's book with the headline ""Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior"". In the excerpt, Chua described how her daughters were never allowed to have sleepovers  , appear in school plays, or earn any grade lower than an A. Chua, an author and professor at Yale Law School, spent much of 2011 on the defensive. In fact, many of her interviews seemed to lend fuel to her critics' fire.
Now, with the book out in paperback, she said, ""I put passages in the book and used very harsh words that I regret. Everybody has those moments you wish you could take back.""
For those who still read Battle Hymn as an advice guide, Chua argues that so-called tiger parenting should be employed mainly during a child's early years, ideally between the ages of 5 and 12. These ""super-strict parenting tactics"" are not meant for all ages. Remaining strict after middle school makes you a helicopter parent, according to Chua. And she is quick to point out how different that is from being a tiger mom.
""By the time kids get to high school, helicopter parents are hiring all these tutors, carrying their kids' sports bags. I never checked older daughter Sophia's papers because I knew she knew how to sit down and focus,"" Chua said.
As for younger daughter Lulu, 15, the rebel for whom the book was written, Chua has really backed off. Instead of forcing Lulu to practise violin for hours a day--the source of their biggest fights, Chua ""let her give that up"". ""My compromise   is that I'm going to still be as strict academically, but in exchange she has a lot of social freedom. Lulu has had four sleepovers in the last two months!"" Chua said. Chua predicts she'll only get more easygoing with age.",high2251.txt
