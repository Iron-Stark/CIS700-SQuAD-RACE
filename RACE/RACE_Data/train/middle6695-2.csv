2,C,"['He goes to restaurants to try all kinds of dishes.', 'He learns how to cook from his parents.', 'He watches shows on TV and tries new recipes.', 'He puts spices into the food to make it tasty.']",What does Mike do to show that he likes cooking so much?,"Hi Suzie,
I have a big problem again! You know that I love to cook. Everyone says that I am the next ""celebrity chef"". I never miss favourite cookery shows on TV. I always like to try new recipes. Curry is one of my favourite meals. I love all the spices and that is the problem!
I am in the kitchen when the telephone rings. I answer the phone and chat for five minutes to my friend Kate. I go back to my curry, but I don't remember that the spices are already in and I add more. My curry smells delicious, but when we eat it everyone looks at me. The curry tastes very bad. My mum says, ""Why is it so hot?""
Then I remember about the spices.
I'm off for a hamburger.
Love,
Mike",middle6695.txt
