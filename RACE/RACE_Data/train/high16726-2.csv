2,B,"['17th', '19th', '16th', '18th']",Breakfast became a family meal since the   _   century.,"It is surprising that eating three meals a day--breakfast,lunch and dinner-has been a custom  only since 1890. Before this time,people only had two meals a day--breakfast and dinner.
In the 16th century,breakfast was only to break one's fast . But 200 years later it had become a large meal,not just for family,but for numbers of guests as well. It was a social event. It began at 10 a.m. and lasted until 1 p.m. Then breakfast began to be less popular. It became,instead,a lighter meal and was taken at a much earlier hour. By 1850 it had been pushed back to 8 a.m. and became a family meal.
Dinner,however,went to the other way. In the 16th century it was eaten at 11 a.m. Years later,it had moved to the early afternoon,then to 5 p.m. By 1850 dinner time had reached 7 p.m. Lunch is a recent idea. It first appeared as a snack to fill the gap  between breakfast and dinner.",high16726.txt
