0,C,"['a suggestion letter', 'a greeting card', 'a graduation speech', 'a letter of congratulations']",This passage is most probably   _  .,"Good evening parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles and friends. I would like to thank you all for coming on this very special day for every student on this stage. I know how proud you must be. As we have grown over the years, there are many steps and stages we all have gone through. From learning our shapes and color1s, to getting our first kiss in middle school, or how about explaining to our parents why we skipped school because the headmaster called home. As we remember these days, things that we've done will be with us forever. But this is only the start of our journey. To graduate is one more step we've taken in our lives.
Now I would like to take the time to thank everyone who has helped me get this far. First of all, thank you to all the teachers. None of us would be here without you always pushing our studying abilities to the fullest. My brother Jeramie who always said, ""If anyone is meant to you, I'll take care of it."" My mom, thank you for always believing in me and putting up with me. And last but not least, my dad, for proving to me that I always need to take responsibility for my actions and deal with the results. Thank you all! I love you. Now, advice to the students! Many of you think, ""This is as good as it gets!"" but the future holds a bigger plan for all of us. So good luck and congratulations to the class of 2015. We did it!",high19785.txt
