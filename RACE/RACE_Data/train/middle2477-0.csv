0,C,"['Pictures', 'Maps', 'Signs', 'Photos']",What are there on the wall of the library?,"Our school has a big library. We often go there. Today is Sunday. Lily and I are in the library. In the library there are some signs on the wall. The signs mean   different   things. We know them. Don't shout in the reading room. Don't drink or eat here. Don't litter   in the library.
I see a man smoking in the reading room. I go to him and say, ""Sir, you can't smoke here. Look at the sign. It says 'No smoking'.You can smoke in the smoking room."" The man says sorry.",middle2477.txt
