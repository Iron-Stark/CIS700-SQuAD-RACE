0,A,"['513', '1,646', '2,159', '3,805']",A Japanese worker works   _   more hours a year than a French one.,"Many people say that they are working too many hours. They don't have enough time to relax or to stay with their family.
     Work hours are different from one country to another. In France, people spend about 1,646 hours a year at work. In Japan, however, people work about 2,159 hours a year.
     Why do people work so many hours? Some people work extra hours because they want to make more money. However, many companies don't pay overtime. Their workers don't get more pay for more work. Some people think it's their duty to work more hours. Some are afraid of losing their jobs if they don't work more hours.
     Many people say that their vacations are too short. In France, people get five weeks of paid vacation a year. In Germany, they get four to six weeks, and in the United States, two weeks. One study shows fewer than half of workers used all their vacation days. In Great Britain, there is a saying, ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull   boy."" If that is true, there must be a lot of dull people in the world.",high24055.txt
