1,A,"['they want people to notice them', 'they want to make great troubles', 'they want to excite people around', 'they want to make some interesting events']",One of the things the young are engaged in seeking is that   _  .,"People are always talking about ""the problem of youth"". If there is one--which I take leave to doubt--then it is older people who create it, not the young themselves. Let us get down to something basic and agree that the young are after all human beings--people just like their elders. There is only one difference between an old man and a young one: the young man has a beautiful future before him and the old one has a splendid future behind him and maybe that is where the _ is.
When I was a teenager, I felt that I was just young and unknown--that I was a new boy in a huge school, and I would have been very pleased to be regarded as something so interesting as a problem. For one thing, being a problem gives you a certain identity, and that is one of the things the young are busily engaged in seeking.
I find young people exciting. They have an air of freedom, and they have not a dull promise to mean ambitions  or love of comfort. They are not anxious social climbers, and they have no devotion to important things. All these seem to me to link them with life, and the origins of things. It is as if they were in some sense from outside space and lovely contrast with us suburban people. All that is in my mind when I meet a young person. He may be ill-mannered, self-confident, but I do not turn for protection to boring cliches  about respect for elders as if the age is a reason for respect. I accept that we are equals, and I will argue with him, as an equal, if I think he is wrong.",high6900.txt
