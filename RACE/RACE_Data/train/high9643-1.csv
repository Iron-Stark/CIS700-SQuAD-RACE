Let go
Many times we are held back by our previous failures,emotions and barriers . This is all old baggage. Let everything unhappy from the past go. Let go of failures. Let go of fears you've built up. Let go of your ideas about what your life has to be like. Let go of long-held beliefs and habits which seem to be burdens  to you.
Clear away distractions 
Clear away email, your favourite blogs and news websites. Clearaway the iPhone or Blackberry, and clear away all the _ that pull at your attention. In fact, if you can, shut off the Internet for a while. You can come back to it after you take a break.
Decide what matters most today
Forget about your goals for all of this year. Instead, decide what you want to do today. What matters most to you and your life? What are you most passionate  about right now? What excites you? What gives you the most fulfillment ? Often the answer would be in creating something, making something new, helping others, becoming a better person, and working on a project that you will be proud of. But whatever your answer, have it clear in your mind at the beginning of the day.
Reinvent yourself every day
Every day, you are reborn.Reinvent yourself and your life. Do what matters most to you. It might be the same thing that mattered most yesterday, or it might not be. That isn't important. What's important is today---right now! Be passionate, and be happy!
You'll have a fresh start every single day---not just on January 1 of a new year.",high9643.txt
