4,D,"['Because the shop had sold out all their bread.', ""Because her mother asked her to get anything if they hadn't had bread."", 'Because she loved playing with hula hoop.', 'All the above']",Why did she do this?,"One day we invited some friends to dinner. When it was about six o'clock, my wife found that we had little bread. So she asked our five-year-old daughter, Kathy, to buy some.
'Here's a dollar,' my wife said, 'get two loaves of bread, if they have it. If they don't have it, get anything. But hurry!'
Kathy hurried off, and we waited and waited. By a quarter past six, all the friends had arrived. But Kathy had not returned. Finally we saw her dancing around the corner with a bright new hula hoop  whirling  round her middle.
""Kathy!"" her mother cried. ""Where did you get that hula hoop, and where is the bread?""
""Well, when I got to the shop, they had sold out all their bread,"" answered Kathy. ""And you said 'If they don't have that, get anything!'""",middle706.txt
