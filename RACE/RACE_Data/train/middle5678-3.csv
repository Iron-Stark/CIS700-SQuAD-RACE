3,A,"['David Prang was the real winner', 'Mr Watson was the real winner', 'Neither of them was the real winner', 'Both of them were the real winners']","From the story,we know that  _","Watson won his most important game and became Southern Chess Master  in 1977.He was given the silver  cup.
""It isn't rightly mine.""he said,when he was holding the cup,  ""It was won two years ago when I was on holiday in....""
""A family was staying at my hotel at that time.Mrs Prang,the mother,was told that I played chess;and she begged me to give her young son a game."" ""He's only ten.""She said,Ive been told that you play quite well.""
""Well,as you can guess.I wasn't too happy. A player likes the opponent  to play as well as he does. But it was holiday time and I agreed to play. We placed the board  in the garden. The game began .I hoped it would be quick-----and so it was.""
""I soon knew that David Prang was no learner.After ten minutes his sister came outside and began to play tennis against in our game. He moved a piece  without care. I gave my attention to the board.""
""Call me when you are ready,Mr Watson,""he said.
""When I was ready?"" I looked up. He had gone off to play with his sister,I studied the board-----and found I was driven into a corner. So it went on with David;a quick move,then tennis,back to the board,then back to his sister.My difficult condition became impossible to change. I was beaten,oh,so easily,by a ten-year-old chess player. He was the winner--in twenty-eight minutes.""
""David Prang:a name to remember.I had a chance to use his game today and it won this cup for me. To him,of course,it'sonly one of a hundred,or perhaps a thousand,winning games.""",middle5678.txt
