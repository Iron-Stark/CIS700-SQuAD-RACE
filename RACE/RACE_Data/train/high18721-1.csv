1,D,"['there are some skillful pilots', 'pilots have no cars to drive', 'pilots can\'t afford a""roadable""plane', 'cars can fly in the sky']","We can infer that in the""Back to the Future""movies_.","Is been a dream for 30 years but now the world's first flying car is set to hit the roads this year.
    Ever since the""Back to the Future""movies lit up our screens in the 1980s,designers have dreamt of cars that could take to the sky at the push of a button. And now pilots can order their own ""roadable""plane for just PS 127,000.
    The plane,which has fold-out wings that span 17. 5 ft,has a range of flying distance of 460 miles and can be up to 115 mph. Back on the land,it can also travel at""highway speeds""
in car mode . 
      Fuelling the 19 ft long plane couldn't be simpler--you just drive it into a petrol station and fill it up. 
     A spokeswoman said,""You can keep you 'light-sport airplane'in your garage. But because _ needs a short runway to take to the air,you will have to drive to your local airport,fly up to 460 miles,land,and drive directly to your destination. You will always be ready to drive or fly. ""
      The spokeswoman added,""Never let bad weather change your trip. You call simply divert and continue on the ground until the weather clears. ""    
      There's no risk to you--This is only the chance for you to be the first at your home field to unfold your wings and fly into the future.",high18721.txt
