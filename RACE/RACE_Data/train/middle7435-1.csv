1,A,"['Encourage ourselves to rise above them.', 'Be ready to lose our belief.', 'Run away before they come.', ""Use the nature's power to hide ourselves.""]",What should we do when the storms of life come to us?,"Do you know what an eagle  does when a storm is coming?
The eagle will fly to some high spot and wait for the winds to come. When the storm hits, it opens its wings so that the wind will pick it up and lift it above the storm. While the storm rages  below, the eagle is flying above it.
The eagle does not shirk the storm. It simply uses the storm to lift it higher. It rises on the winds that bring the storm.
When the storms of life come to us--- and all of us will experience them--- we can rise above them by setting our minds and our belief, like an eagle does. The storms do not have to beat us. We can use the nature's power to lift us above them.
We are able to ride the winds of the storm that bring sickness, tragedy, failure and disappointment in our lives. We can fly above the storm.
Remember, it is not the burdens  of life that weigh us down, it is how we face them.",middle7435.txt
