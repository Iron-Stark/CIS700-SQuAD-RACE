3,B,"['Volunteer Work.', 'The Spirit of Lei Feng Is Everywhere.', 'Positive Energy.', 'Lei Feng Is Outdated.']",What is the best title for this passage?,"March 5 is ""Lei Feng Day"". Fifty years ago on this day, Chairman Mao Zedong called on people to ""learn from Lei Feng"". Now half a century has passed. Is the spirit of Lei Feng outdated? Some people have shown us that it's not. But people have also changed the ways in which they help others.
Li Yulin, who works in a hospital in Hang Zhou, Zhejiang, has been a volunteer for 15 years. He still remembers his experience in an old people's home several years ago. An old woman held his hand and said, ""You don't need to do anything for us. Seeing young people like you here is all we need."" Those words made Li think: in what ways can we help people better? ""Every person does what they can, no matter how small it is, to give out positive energy. And before we lend a helping hand, we should find out what they want,"" Li said to the Qianjiang Evening News.
As well as Li, other people have shown their understanding of the spirit of Lei Feng. A ""noodle fever"" swept Zhengzhou, Henan in January. It started with an online post. Li Gang, a 42-year-old local man, said in the post that he has got cancer. He needed a lot of money for an operation. He was not asking for donations, but hoped people would come to eat at his restaurant. Li's post spread quickly. Soon his restaurant was filled with people every day. Li had an operation on Feb. 2 and now he is getting better.
""It is good to help Li and his family like this for it shows them respect and doesn't hurt their pride,"" Qianjiang Evening News said.",middle2166.txt
