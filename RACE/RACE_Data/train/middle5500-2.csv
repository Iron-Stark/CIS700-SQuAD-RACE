2,D,"[""they cause many people's death"", 'they control the population of mice', 'they are not dangerous to people', 'they are only a small number']","Although some snakes are poisonous,   _  .","I think it is safe to say that snakes are not popular among most people. It would be hard to find a person who is neutral  ,or simply doesn't care one way or the other. What I wonder is why something even without legs causes such great fear.
Snakes are quite useful, but that doesn't seem to matter. Snakes help control the population of mice. Without snakes, perhaps we would find mice everywhere. Most of us, however, would rather see a mouse than a snake.
The poison argument   is a strong one. Some snakes are poisonous, and this causes people's death. However, the poisonous snakes are only a small number. We can't say all the snakes are bad just because of a few dangerous ones.
And what do we do with the people who really like snakes? They like snakes even more strongly than we dislike them. These people learn about them, find them out, and watch them carefully. Why? The only reason I can think of is that these people are open-minded. They are able to put aside differences and welcome the snake as a friend.
Whatever the reason for our like or dislike, snakes do something good in the circle of life. They would prefer to be left alone, and that is what we should do. If you're lucky, you might not run across more than a few of them in a lifetime. That would be fine with most of us.",middle5500.txt
