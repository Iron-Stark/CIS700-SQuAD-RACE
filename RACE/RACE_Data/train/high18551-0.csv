0,D,"['a pretty notice to find her', 'an inspiring story to move her', 'an exciting program to attract her', 'a rough drawing to discover her']",After Moborg lost the girl in the crowd he set up a website with_.,"A modern-day love story of a man seeing the girl of his dreams across a New York subway train and tracking her down over the Internet has failed to have a fairytale ending with the relationship over.
For Web designer Patrick Moberg, then 21, from Brooklyn, it was love at first sight when he saw a woman on a Manthttan train last November. But he lost her in the crowd so he set up a website with a sketch picture to find her--www.Nygirlofmydreams.com.
Unbelievably in a city of 8 million people, it only took Moberg 48 hours to find the woman, with his phone ringing non-stop and email box overflowing. New Yorkers took pity on the subway Romeo and joined his hunt.
The mysterious girl was named as Camille Hayton, from Melbourne, Australia, who was working at the magazine Black Book and also lived in Brooklyn. One of her friends saw the sketched picture on the Web site and recognized her.
But after finding each other, appearing on TV and getting international press, the couple took their romance out of the public eye, with Moberg closing down the Web site and with both refusing to make any more comments--until now.
Hayton told Australian newspaper The Sunday Telegraph that she dated Moberg for about two months but it just didn't work out.
""I say we dated for a while but now we're just friends,"" Hayton, now 23, told the newspaper. Hayton said she is still recognized about three times a week on the streets of Manhattan as ""that girl"" and the question is always the same: ""So what happened?""
""I think the situation was so intense that it linked us,"" she said, adding, ""it linked us in a way that you could mistake, I guess, for being more romantic than it was. I don't know. But I wanted to give it a go so didn't wonder what if, what if?""
Hayton told The Sunday Telegraph that she is enjoying single life in New York, keeping busy with acting classes, working in two clothing stores. Last week she had a small role as a waitress in the long-running daytime soap As the World Turns.
""I just can't believe it happened. It feels like a long time ago,"" said Hayton. Moberg, however, was still refusing to comment on the relationship.",high18551.txt
