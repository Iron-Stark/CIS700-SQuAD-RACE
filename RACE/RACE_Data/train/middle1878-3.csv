When I left school five years ago, I said to myself, _ No more learning for me.Now I can enjoy myself in the evening."" But about a year ago the boss said, ""We're going to get a computer in the near future."" What does he mean? I simply don't know.Anyway, I decided to go to evening classes.I'm quite an expert  on computers now and you know, I actually enjoy studying.

I haven't much interest in studying.To be honest, I don't like reading very much, except for magazines and that sort of thing.Just reading, that is, to kill the time.But I do enjoy watching TV.Not that I watch everything.In fact, I choose my programmes very carefully.I'm particularly interested in current affairs .In some ways I think I learn more in this way than I did at school.

I'm a very different sort of person-I simply love doing things.That's why I enjoy sports so much.I mean, actually playing.I hardly ever watch it on TV, but I do read quite a bit about it.I'm even interested in the history of sports.I don't have much time for anything else, except that I quite like dancing.Some people say I'm not very good at it, though.
Joan
I should say I have great interest in studying.I'd rather do this than anything else.Since I left school.I've taken courses in all sorts of things.I go to the city library once a week, but I much prefer evening classes because it's more fun that way.My latest ""craze ""-if you can call it that -is foreign languages.I'm learning two, not one!",middle1878.txt
