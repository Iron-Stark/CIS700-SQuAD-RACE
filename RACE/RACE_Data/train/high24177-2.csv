2,D,"['wrote a large number of botany books', 'left the writer some ancient but beautiful botany books', 'was unusually famous for her achievements', 'could become a botanist in the special time']",The writer considered her grandmother remarkable and interesting because she   _  .,"Looking through a magazine in a waiting room recently, I came across an article with the title ""My top five most precious possessions"".It was just a few lines of text with pictures, but it caught my imagination. It's interesting how inanimate  objects can take on such significance and become woven into a person's, and sometimes a whole family's life history.
Anyway, the article had me considering what my most precious possessions are. It was difficult to choose only five, but here are mine: 
An old cardboard box filled with my children's baby photos.
A yellow pocketsized birthday book of special things (poems, pictures of flowers and trees, etc) given to me by my dad when I was probably about seven or eight years old.
A 21st Birthday card from my mum. In it she's written her congratulations, her love, and her hopes for my future. She died not long after, when I was in my early twenties.
A few ancient but very beautiful botany books that were once my great grandmother's. She was a botanist in a time when it was  ly unusual for women to be qualified in this field and I think she was probably a remarkable and very interesting woman. I'd like to have known her.
A brooch  left to me by my muchloved grandmother. It was given to my great grandmother (her mother) by my great grandfather on his return from World War I. It is not worth anything in terms of money. However, it not only stands for a link between four generations of women, but it is also a reminder of one young man's return from World War I.
How about you? I'd love to hear what you feel are your most precious possessions.",high24177.txt
