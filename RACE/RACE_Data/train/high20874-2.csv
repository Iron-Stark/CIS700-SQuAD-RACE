""If a woman goes for a job interview poorly dressed, she won't get the job, ""Lublin says.""But without a job, she can't afford suitable clothes.""
     So, with the money Lublin founded ""Dress for Success' and began collecting women's clothes which were still in good condition but which their owners no longer needed."" So many women have clothes lying around that they will never wear again,"" one of Lublin's assistants says, ""Nancy's idea is so simple and yet so important to women.""

Here, they receive a suit, shoes and any other things they need, Since it was set up, more than 1,000 women have turned to ""Dress for Success"" for help. Many of them have won job. Some have round jobs after being out of work for many years.
