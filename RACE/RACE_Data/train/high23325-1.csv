1,D,"['The Thought from NYC Subway', 'Bad Experiences in NYC Subway', 'The Train in NYC Subway', 'A Glimpse of NYC Subway']",What is the best title for this passage?,"Subway is always my favorite transportation. To me , it is more than just a convenient way to go around, it is also a way you can feel the heart-beat of a city. In Shanghai, it jumps in perfect. In Paris, it is silent and slow. In New York, it is busy, busy and busy. 
   During rush hour in New York, it will be full of people. You'd better be careful which stairs you are using. If you go wrong , don't be surprised if someone calls ""idiot"", and don't be shy to call back. The trains here are like working bees, running within the day's enormous underground system. They live in the dark all year long, breathing hard together with shameless NY rats and trash. 
In summer , the underground is nasty since there is no air conditioning. However, it can be street performers' favorite in winter--- dry, warm, fits so well with the free, creative atmosphere. They can be bands, doing music or dance, with instruments or voices. There was a young man making storm like intense music by hitting some buckets with hands. There was also a band of three black men, singing together with their pure voices. It is New York City. You are expecting to see those performers in different color1s , ages doing all sorts of stuff from Chinese Erhu to African drums. It is like a romance between a small, beautiful ballad dancer a giant, iron cold wrestler. 
Late night, when everything dies down, the trains are still running but picking up fewer and fewer people. They are like the city, too tough to feel lonely, too focused to stop working.",high23325.txt
