You have the education and the work experience; now all you need is the job. Most people spend more time getting ready for an evening out than they do preparing for a job interview. There are several things you can do to have a successful job interview. Here are some of them:
1. Know about the company where you are trying to get a job. Find out what the company does and who their competitors  are.
2. Know yourself. Most interviewers will ask a question related to your strengths and weaknesses. Before the interview, examine the job you are applying for and determine the top skills needed for that position. For instance, if you are applying for a job as a telephone operator, it's more important that you have strong communication skills than that you are tidy.
3. Have proof. It's easy to say you have good organization skills. But if you can tell the interviewer about a time you organized an event, it makes the claim much more solid.
4. Prepare questions to ask about the company and the job.
An interview is a stressful event. When you are under pressure, it can be difficult to think straight. Preparing before the interview will make it easier to give answers to those tough questions. But you can't think of every question they might ask. So relax and be confident. Remember, first impressions are lasting.",high14088.txt
