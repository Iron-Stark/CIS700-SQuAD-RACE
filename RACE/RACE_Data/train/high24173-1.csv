1,C,"['""You are right""', '""I am sorry if ...""', '""I was wrong.""', '""Well, my day was just so...""']","When offering an apology , which of the following does the author prefer?","How do apology languages work? Have you ever tried to apologize, only to be refused? It may be that you were offering a partial apology in a ""language"" , that was foreign to your listener. The five languages of apology include:
Apology Language 1: ""I am sorry.""
List the hurtful effects of your action. Not ""I am sorry if ..."", but ""I am sorry that..."". You might ask if they want to add any points that you have not recognized.
Apology Language 2:""I was wrong.""
     Name your mistake and accept fault. Note that it is easier to say ""You are right"" than "" I am wrong"", but the latter carries more weight.
Apology Language 3: "" What can I do to make it right?""
     How are you now? How shall I make amends  to you? How can I restore your confidence that I love you-- even though I was so hurtful to you?
Apology Language 4: ""I'll try not to do that again.""
     Engage in problem-solving. Don't make excuses for yourself such as, ""Well, my day was just so..."" Instead, offer what you will change to prevent yourself from putting them in the same bad situation again.
Apology Language 5: ""Will you please forgive me?""
      Be patient in seeking forgiveness. They may need some time or greater clarification of your input from Apology Languages 1-4.
      Finally, your apology may not be accepted, but at least you know that you have been faithful in offering a sincere olive branch of peace.",high24173.txt
