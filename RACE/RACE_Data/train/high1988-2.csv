2,C,"['find two subjects with overlapping classes', 'learn about what your potential employers want', 'decide what to learn with your intentions considered', 'try to decide on some common pairings as soon as possible']","If you are devoted to a double major or degree, you should   _  .","Today, when there are many top graduates looking for top jobs, graduates can differentiate  themselves by obtaining a double major or even a double degree. Increasingly, employers are looking for individuals who are not only competent and intelligent, but who have different skill sets and who are knowledgeable in many areas. Part of the appeal to employers is that your extra work demonstrates a willingness to take on difficult tasks. Additionally, if your majors overlap  , you are able to show potential employers that you have both _ and depth of knowledge.
By studying for a double major, although you will be studying for only one degree, you will be focusing on two related and integrated subjects that complement   each other. Classes overlap between the majors, meaning fewer classes are required than with a double degree, so it is easier to finish within four years.
In contrast, with the more rigorous   double degree, you will be studying for two different degrees in two completely different areas of study. Although pursuing such a course    of study allows students to complete two wholly separate degrees in less time than if they  were to earn them separately, many strong students still find it incredibly difficult to complete in four or five years.
If you are committed to a double major/degree, it is wise to do a little bit of planning. Some students try to find two courses of studies that are related, while others seek to round out their academic studies by choosing two completely unrelated fields.
For double majors, common pairings include: (i) economics and a foreign language; (ii) political science or government and journalism; (iii) economics and psychology.
For double degrees, common pairings include: (i) engineering and a business program such as finance or accounting; (ii) engineering and economics.",high1988.txt
