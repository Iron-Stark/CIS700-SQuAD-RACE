3,A,"['The school bus always went that way.', 'She wanted to stay with her mother longer.', ""She didn't want to get to school to early."", 'She wanted to take other children to school.']",Why did Mary make her mother go a long way?,"When Mary was seven, her family moved to a new town. She usually went to school by bus, for it was not near her house.
One morning, their family clock stopped and when they got up, it was too late for Mary to catch the school bus. Her mother said she would drive Mary to school on her way to the office.
""But how can you find the way, Mum?"" Mary asked. "" You have only been to my school once.
""Yes,"" her mother answered. ""But you've been there by school bus seven times, you know the way. ""Oh, yes"" said Mary.
They started out and Mary asked her mother to turn one way or another on their way to school, so she made her mother drive round most of the town before they got there. When they arrived, her mother found it was not really very far from their house.
""Why did you make me go such a long way?"" her mother asked her. ""Well, Mum."" answered Mary. ""I know only this way. The bus always goes like this, so the other children can take it to school.""",middle6420.txt
