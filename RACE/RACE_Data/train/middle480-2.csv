2,C,"['Jenny lives close to the restaurant', 'He is afraid of spending much money', 'It is far away for them to ride to buy it.', 'He is busy preparing for the exam']",Why does Leo ask Jenny's mom to buy fried chicken?,"Dear Jenny,
Gary is having a _ party after Month Exam! He invites all of us to come! Since it is a potluck party, I think I will bring some beef noodles. As I know, Lily will take care of the drinks and Gina will bring a big homemade chocolate cake. Can you ask your mom to buy us some KFC fried chicken? You know it is too far for all of us to ride a bike there, but your mom often drives there. We can pay the bill together. Just think about how surprised our classmates will feel when they see what we prepare! Isn't it great?
The party will start at noon on March 25, so be sure to be at Gary's place around 11:30 to prepare for the party. By the way, don't forget to invite Amy, who is good at music. If you have any other questions, just call me or write me back.
Take care!
