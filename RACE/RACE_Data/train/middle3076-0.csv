I was very tired. The clothes were just one thing. He had already kicked a large hole in his bedroom wall. Many windows were broken because of his breaking in to steal money. Brett came to live with us when he was 12 years old. During those four years I had dealt with Brett as patiently as possible, but inside I was feeling sad. Later, I cheered up again and continued parenting Brett. Still, Brett did not change his behavior.
When Brett was nearly 18, my husband and I decided to send Brett to a boarding school that had very good result with troubled teenagers.

Brett spoke lovingly to me, ""You did so much. You were always there, no matter what
happened.You always showed me such love. And I want you to know that I love you for ""it"".
Surprised, I stood as Brett placed the white rose in my hand and hugged me hard. At that moment I realized the truth-although I had been angry in my heart toward my stepson, Brett had seen only my actions.",middle3076.txt
