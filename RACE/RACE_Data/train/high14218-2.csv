2,B,"['The professor often kept his students sharp by using a textbook alarm.', ""The author was attracted by the professor's great wisdom and enthusiasm."", 'The author left the two-hour period not only wide awake, but a little smarter.', 'Though the author was frightened awake, he was not clear-headed in the class.']",What can be inferred from this passage?,"I can still remember it as if it happened yesterday. I was a college freshman and had stayed up most of the night before laughing and talking with friends. Now just before my first class of the day my eyelids were feeling heavier and heavier and my head was drifting down to my desk to make my textbook a pillow. A few minutes' nap time before class couldn't hurt, I thought.
Boom! I lifted my head immediately and my eyes opened wider than saucers. I looked around with my heart beating quickly trying to find the cause of the noise. My young professor was looking back at me with a _ , boyish smile on his face. He had intentionally dropped the pile of textbooks he was carrying onto my desk. ""Good morning!"" he said, still smiling. ""I'm glad to see everyone is awake. Now let's get started.""
For the next hour I wasn't sleepy at all. It wasn't from the shock of my professor's textbook alarm clock either. Instead, it was from the attractive discussion he led. With knowledge and good humor, he made the material come alive. His insights were full of both wisdom and loving kindness. And the enthusiasm and joy that he taught with were contagious  . I left the classroom not only wide awake, but a little smarter and a little better as well.
I learned something far more important than not sleeping in class that day too. I learned that if you are going to do something in this life, do it well, do it with joy, and make it an expression of your love. What a glorious place this world would be if all of us did our work joyously and well! What a beautiful world we could create if every doctor, teacher, musician, cook, waitress, poet, miner, farmer, and laborer made their work an expression of their love! Don't sleepwalk your way through life then. Wake up! Let your love fill your work and your soul. Life is too short not to live it well.",high14218.txt
