0,B,"['ten', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'Thirteen']",Same and Tim are    _    years old this year.,"Hi, I'm Sam from New York. I have a brother called Tim. We are twins. We are both eleven this year. I am ten minutes older than him. In some ways, we look the same and in some ways, we look different. However, he is taller than me. I am shy, but he is outgoing. We both like playing sports and we often play football together after class. We are in the same school but we are not in the same class. I am in Class One and he is in Class Three.

and she couldn't tell Tim from me.",middle8207.txt
