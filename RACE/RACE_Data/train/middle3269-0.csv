0,B,"['Guy', 'Bert', ""Bert's friend"", ""Guy's brother""]",_  Invited the writer to his birthday party.,"Yesterday was my friend Bert's birthday. He invited me to his house for his birthday party. Another friend Guy could take me to the party by car.
Well,I was getting dressed when Guy rang and said he was ill. So I decided to go by train. Unluckily, when I was talking on the phone, the cat walked over my shirt. Then I spent a few minutes finding another one and I was late for leaving.
As I was walking to the station, it started snowing and I got very cold. I just missed  a train and I had to wait for another one. Half an hour later, the train arrived. I was so cold and tired that I fell asleep on the train and missed my station.
Well, I got off at the next station, and decided to walk to Bert's house. I walked for 10 minutes but I got lost. Then I took a taxi. When I arrived at Bert's house, the party nearly finished and people were leaving. What a terrible day!",middle3269.txt
