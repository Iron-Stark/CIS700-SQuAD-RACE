""We get lots of bands to perform live in the studio,"" says producer Chris Cowey. ""That just doesn't happen on other shows""
Chris starts the preparations for the programme over a week before it goes out.His first job is to decide which bands to have on the show. When the chart of the top twenty songs is produced on Sunday, Chris can start to book the bands
Monday starts with Chris meeting his sound, lighting and camera workers. They listen to each song and plan the show.
Tuesday is paperwork day. There are bookings to make sure of, letters to answer and lots of phone calls to make. The show is on Thursday. Bands arrive at the studio from 10 o'clock in the morning and start practicing. Tonight's presenter, Jo Whiley, practises too
First the bands go to make up. Judy and Issy are the make-up artists. ""We see the stars with no make-up on, looking terrible,"" says Issy. Then the bands go to the costume department where Marianne dresses the stars.
Back in the studio things are happening. The audience is practising their dance moves! It takes over two hours to record the whole programme, then Chris edits it all night long. The final version is exactly 29 minutes long",high455.txt
