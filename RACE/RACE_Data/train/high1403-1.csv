1,B,"[""Because he didn't go along with his father."", 'Because he was rude to his father that morning.', 'Because he failed to come earlier after the accident.', ""Because he couldn't look after his father in the hospital.""]",Why did the author say sorry to his father in the hospital?,"It was a Sunday morning, and I was in a terrible mood. Two of my friends had gone to the movies the night before and hadn't invited me. I was in my room thinking of ways to make them sorry when my father came in. ""Want to go for a ride, today, Beck? It's a beautiful day.""
""No! Leave me alone!"" Those were the last words I said to him that morning.
My friends called and invited me to go to the mall with them a few hours later. I forgot to be mad at them and went with them. I came home to find a note on the table. My mother put it where I would be sure to see it. ""Dad has had an accident. Please meet us at Highland Park Hospital"".
When I reached the hospital, my mother came out and told me my father's injuries were extensive. ""Your father told the driver to leave him alone and just call 911, thank God! If he had moved Daddy, there's no telling what might have happened. A broken rib  might have pierced  a lung....""
My mother may have said more, but I didn't hear. I didn't hear anything except those terrible words: Leave me alone. My dad said them to save himself from being hurt more. How much had I hurt him when I hurled those words at him earlier in the day?
It was several days later that he was finally able to have a conversation. I held his hand gently, afraid of hurting him.
""Daddy... I am so sorry....""
""It's okay, sweetheart. I'll be okay.""
""No,"" I said, ""I mean about what I said to you that day. You know, that morning?""
My father could no more tell a lie than he could fly. He looked at me and said, ""Sweetheart, I don't remember anything about that day, not before, during or after the accident. I remember kissing you goodnight the night before, though."" He managed a weak smile.
My English teacher once told me that words have immeasurable power. They can hurt or they can heal. And we all have the power to choose our words. I intend to do that very carefully from now on.",high1403.txt
