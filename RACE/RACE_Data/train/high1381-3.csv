3,A,"['He first asked for something else.', 'He asked for it earnestly  .', 'He worked for them.', 'He spoke highly of Mr. Wu.']",How did the neighbor manage to get what he really wanted?,"Mr. and Mrs. Wu were fed up with their neighbor. He was always borrowing things from them.
""It's not right."" Mr. Wu said to his wife one evening. ""At some time or another that man has borrowed nearly everything we have. Almost every day he comes over to borrow something.""
""You are quite right,"" his wife replied, ""and most of the things he's never returned.""
""What I want to know,"" her husband said, ""is why he can't buy the things he needs like everyone else.""
""Because people like us are foolish enough to lend him what he needs."" she replied. ""As long as we are willing to lend, he'll keep on borrowing.""
""Then we'll never lend him anything again."" Mr. Wu said. ""The next time he asks to borrow something, I'll say no.""
""We must have a good reason for saying no,"" his wire said, ""and we must always try to be polite to him. We don't want to make an enemy of the man.""
It was not long before their decision not to lend their neighbor anything ever again was put to the test.
The next morning there was a knock on the door.
Mr. Wu went to answer it.
Their neighbor was standing there. Mr. Wu knew he was going to ask to borrow something, and was ready to refuse him politely.
""Good morning,"" their neighbor said, ""I'm sorry to trouble you, but I wonder if I could borrow your garden scissors.""
""I'm sorry,"" Mr. Wu said, ""but I'm afraid my wife and I will be using them today. We'll be spending all day working in the garden.""
""Oh, ! see."" the neighbor said, ""In that case, may I borrow your golf clubs? You won't be needing them if you are working in the garden all day, will you?""",high1381.txt
