1,A,"['was a great success', 'attracted a great number of directors', 'was based on a film', 'was supported by a film producer']",Sudha's performance in Bombay   _  .,"Sudha Chandran, a classical dancer from India, had to have her right leg cut after a car accident.She was also cut off on her bright career road.
However, she didn't stop struggling. In the painful three months that followed, Sudha met a doctor who had an operation on her leg. So strongly she wanted to go back to dancing after she had been fitted with a man-made leg. Sudha knew that she believed in herself and could realize her dream,so she began her brave journey back to the world of dancing -- learning to balance, bend, stretch,walk, and turn.
After every public recital  , she might ask her dad about her performance. ""You stillhave a long way to go"" was the answer she used to get in return. In January 1984, Sudha gained popularity again by giving a public recital in Bombay. She performed in such a great manner that it moved everyone to tears and this performance pushed her to the number one position again. That evening when she asked her dad the same question, he didn't say anything. He just touched her feet as a praise.
Sudha's comeback was so touching that a film producer decided to make the story into a film,which has moved more and more people.
When someone asked Sudha how she had managed to dance again, she said quite simply, ""YOU DON'T NEED FEET TO DANCE."" Nothing is impossible in this world. If you have the will to win,you can achieve anything.",high14116.txt
