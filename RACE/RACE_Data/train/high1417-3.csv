3,C,"[""Girls should follow hairstylists' advice to change their hairstyles every day."", 'Girls should wear high heels though they might be uncomfortable.', 'Trying to be healthy is more important than trying to be thin.', 'Having a good hairstyle is more important than wearing fashionable shoes.']",What can we learn from the passage?,"Almost every girl wants to be healthy and beautiful. They try every means to make themselves look smarter. ""What are the best ways?"" Many girls may have this question in mind.
Here is some advice that is very important for girls to follow.
Keep fit. Check with your doctor for your proper weight range and work to get and stay within it. Exercise, eat properly, and drink plenty of water to achieve that weight and be as healthy as you can be. As long as you're in your healthy range, you'll look great.
Mind your style, from top to bottom. There are two things that can make or break your look: your hair and your shoes. Look through hair magazines and talk with your hairstylist about what will look good with your face structure. Always keep your hair clean and styled. Wear clean, feminine shoes. That doesn't mean you always have to wear high heels. Make sure you can walk comfortably in them.
Be fashionable. Learn about your body type, height, skin and preferences. Discover yourself, and fashion will come to you. You don't have to wear designer clothes, especially if you can't afford them. You can look through fashion magazines, pick your favourites and then find the similar ones that you can afford.
Smile, and do it like you mean it. Smile, be merry and people will notice that. It will help you in many ways.
Be nice to others. Looking pretty doesn't give you the right to look down on others or treat them badly. Only having good appearance doesn't mean you are beautiful.
However, in order to get slim and beautiful, some girls can easily be absorbed in losing weight, resulting in eating disorders. Keep in mind that being healthy is more important than being thin. So try to eat healthy food, take regular exercise and keep a good mood.",high1417.txt
