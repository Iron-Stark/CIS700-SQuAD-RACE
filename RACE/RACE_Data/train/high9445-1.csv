1,C,"['It is a school bus that can take children to travel.', 'It is a bus giving homeless children a safe place', 'It travels to a place to offer help when a disaster hits it.', 'It is aimed at raising money for places affected by disasters.']",What do we know about C.J.'s Bus?,"When a tornado hit the small town of Otwell, Indiana years ago, Kathryn Martin, 32, who lived 60 miles away in Evansville, couldn't get the news out of her mind. ""I kept thinking, 'Those poor people. Somebody's got to help them,'"" she says. She knew firsthand what they were going through.
Six months earlier, a tornado had struck her town, taking the lives of her 2-year-old son, C.J. and her mother-in-law. ""It was the most terrible experience of my life,"" she says. ""That _ will never go away, and it broke my heart to think about what these families were going through in Otwell.""
So Kathryn loaded her car with juice boxes, snacks and toys and drove to Otwell. She gave the items to the Red Cross, and as she was leaving, she saw a couple sorting through the ruins of their home while their children were watching. So Kathryn stopped and gave a few toys to the kids and played with them for a while. ""The parents couldn't thank me enough for what I did for their children,"" she says.
On the drive back to Evansville, Kathryn came up with an idea to help more kids. She talked her family, friends and neighbors into joining her and spent the next few months organizing fundraisers. Finally, in August 2007, she showed C.J.'s Bus, a 35-foot school bus that was turned into a mobile playroom.
In the following years, stocked with video games and DVDs, toys, crafts, books and more, the bus traveled to disaster-torn towns, giving the children there a safe place to play. So far, C.J.'s bus has traveled to three states affected by tornadoes or floods, cheering up more than 756 children, aged 3-13.",high9445.txt
