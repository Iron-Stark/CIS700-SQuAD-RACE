And most commuters know their train by the precise minute it departs. The trains quickly make up the minute: at all other stops, the public timetable prevails. The phantom minute does not exist at commuter railroads in Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, or San Francisco. But in New York, the secret minute dates back decades.
""That's been done forever, from my knowledge,"" said Jack Swanberg, 70, an unofficial historian of Metro-North. ""I was the trainmaster starting in 1970 and I'm sure it's been the case since 1870 for all I know.""",high15072.txt
