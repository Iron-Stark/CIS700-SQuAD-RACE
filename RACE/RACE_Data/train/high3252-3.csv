3,A,"['The White House will open the records of the visitors to the public.', 'In America more and more people are becoming policy makers.', 'The Americans have a right to know who are making policies.', 'President Obama has announced a new policy while on holiday.']",What's the main idea of the passage?,"WASHINGTON -- It is announced Friday that White House visitor records will be opened up on a regular basis for the first time in modern history, providing the public an unusually detailed look at who gets the opportunity to help shape American policy at the highest levels.
""Americans have a right to know whose voices are being heard in the policymaking process,"" the president said in a written statement issued by the White House while he vacationed with his family at Camp David.
By the end of the year, the White House will begin posting online every month the names of the people who visited in the last 90 to 120 days. Each person's full name will be listed, along with the date and time they entered and left and the name of the person they visited. About 70,000 to 100,000 people visit the White House each month, and the records will include tourists as well as people conducting business.
The White House pointed out several exceptions to the policy: ""purely personal guests"" of the Obama family; those cases in which the disclosure  of visitors' names ""would threaten national safety interests""; and those who come for ""particularly sensitive meetings,"" like candidates for a Supreme Court nomination . Officials said only a ""small number"" will fit in the latter category , and their names would eventually be disclosed after they are no longer secret, like after a nomination is publicly announced. Moreover, they said, the number of undisclosed visitors will be disclosed, to make clear how few they are.",high3252.txt
