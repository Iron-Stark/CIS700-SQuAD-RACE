1,A,"['I was absorbed in my reading', 'the evening light failed', 'I found it impossible to translate the book', 'I was eager to read another book']","After I start reading""The Last of the Just""  _  .","""Take your time,"" Mr. Ballou encouraged.""Read, borrow, and keep.Find something you like.What do you read?""
""Pick for me, then."" I said.
He looked up and down at me as though measuring me for a suit.After a moment, he nodded, and handed me a dark red book, fairly thick.
""The Last of the Just,"" I read.""By Andre Schwarz-Bart.What's it about?""
""You tell me,"" he said.""Next week.""
I started after supper, sitting outdoors on an uncomfortable kitchen chair Within a few pages, the yard, the summer, disappeared.Translated from French, the language was beautiful, simple, impossible to resist.When the evening light finally failed I moved inside, read all through the night.
To this day, thirty years later, I clearly remember the experience.It was my first meeting with world literature, and I was amazed by the strong power a novel contain.I lacked the vocabulary, however, to translate my feelings into words, so the next week, when Mr. Ballou asked,""Well?""I only replied, ""It was good.""
""Keep it, then,""he said.""Shall I suggest another?""
     I nodded, and was presented with Margaret Mead's Coming of Age in Samoa.
     To make the story short, Mr. Ballou never paid me a cent for helping cut his grass that year or the next, but for fifteen years I taught anthroplogy at Dartmouth College.That summer when I started to read became a turning point in my life which change the course of all that followed.",high22027.txt
