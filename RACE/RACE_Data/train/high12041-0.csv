In the first development, a portrait of Shakespeare, which is believed to be the only picture painted of him during his lifetime, was _ in London.
The artwork has been dated back to 1610, meaning it was painted six years before the writer's death.
The painting had been owned by a family descended from Shakespeare's literary patron   tor hundreds of years without them ever knowing who the man in the picture was.
Alec Cobbe, who inherited the portrait, realized that the painting was a likeness of Shakespeare after visiting an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery where he saw a portrait that had, until 70 years ago, been accepted as a life portrait of Shakespeare.
