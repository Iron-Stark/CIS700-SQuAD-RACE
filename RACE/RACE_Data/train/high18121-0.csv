0,C,"['Diligent.', 'Faithful.', 'Inspiring.', 'Stubborn.']",Which word best describe Clay Dyer's deed?,"The other day I was watching Sportscenter when one of those ""human interest "" stories came on and really caught my attention.
The hero was about a 27-year-old professional Bass Fisherman named Clay Dyer. At first, they played it off as another guy trying to make the cut on the Bassmaster tour until they showed a picture of him. No legs, no arms, or rather, he was only1/3 of his right arm. That's all that he has.
It was such an amazing story that I was wondering what this guy could do. Growing up, he learned to play baseball and basketball, but found that fishing was his true calling. And he does it all on his own. He holds the fishing pole under his chin and uses that and his stub arm to cast and reel in the fish. He uses his teeth to help him unhook fish. He ties his own hooks on with his mouth, never really asking anyone else to help. Clay Dyer even knows how to swim. Since his body can't produce enough sweat on its own, he has to take a dip in the lake every few hours to keep cool. He dives in just like anyone else, then somehow treads water  with his stub arm, then, with a little help, pulls himself back up into the boat and goes on fishing.
Clay Dyer has never looked for others' pity, nor has he allowed his physical disabilities to prevent him from becoming a professional fisherman. His motto for life is ""If I can, you can.""He refuses to use special equipment, saying, ""I want to do it with one hand the way they do it with two.",high18121.txt
