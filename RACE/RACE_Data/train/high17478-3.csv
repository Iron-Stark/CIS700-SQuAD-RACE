3,A,"['Teens use Twitter to share rides.', 'Tips               on reducing risks in rideshare', 'Cars are no longer a gateway to freedom.', 'New generation knows how to save money']",Which is the best title for the passage?,"Well, what a bonus! Lots of us are using technology to find rides, and not just to school. It's awkward to call
a friend and ask for a ride, and half the time they'll say, ""Sorry,my car is full."" But with Twitter and Facebook, you just tweet Ashleys Pool Party and look for other people heading the same way.
It may sound risky, but many teens stay within their own social circles to find rides, and don't branch out beyond friends of friends when asking on Twitter. For me, I only rideshare with people I know, but to some young people, especially those taking longer trips, stranger danger is less of a concern.                
The sharing economy got big during the recession   . It allows people to access more goods and services using technology, while also allowing them to share cost. And that, technology, for me, is what the car was for my mom, a gateway to more freedom.  
According to the researchers at the University of Michigan,30 years ago, eight in ten American 18-year-olds had a driver's license. Today it's six in ten. So it's not that surprising that on my 16th birthday I wasn't rushing to get a license. All I wanted was an IPhone, Juliet Schor (Sociology professor at Boston College) knows people of my age love being connected and for young people driving means they have to disconnect from their technology, and that's negative. So if they could sit in the passenger side and still be connected, that's going to be a plus.
To me, another plus is ridesharing represents something much bigger than trying to save money. I see it as evidence that people still depend on each other. My generation shares their cars and apartments the way neighbors used to share cups of sugar. For the system to work, we still need our own cars. But until I get my own version of the silver Super Beetle, you can find me on twitter.",high17478.txt
