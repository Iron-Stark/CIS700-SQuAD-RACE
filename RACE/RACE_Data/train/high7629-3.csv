3,A,"['Computer-driven cars drive much closer together than cars driven by people.', 'Motorists can have a clear view of the road whatever the weather conditions are.', 'Cars will travel in convoy, linked to each other by an electronic tow bar.', 'Intelligent cruise control devices can regulate the distance between one car and another.']","Which of the following sentences can explain ""better use of roads""by 2020 mentioned in the passage?","In many parts of the world, cars play an important role in daily life and many societies would not exist without them. So the idea that in 20 years' time, no one will own cars may be hard to believe. But this is the prediction made by a team of transport researchers who are taken seriously, not only by government but also by car manufacturers.
The Human Science and Advanced Technology Institute at Loughborough in the UK is part of an international research program. The team there believes that by 2020 all cars will be computerized. That will mean much saving, no accidents and better use of roads. The super-intelligent car in the future will drive itself.  And it will not be owned by one individual. Instead, we will have a choice of cars and change them as frequently as we change our clothing.
According to Dr. David Davis, who leads the research team, these predictions are based on the rising cost of the car culture, which had blocked up our cities, polluted our air, and caused more deaths than both world wars put together.
Davis says, cars will be fitted with some intelligent devices  to regulate  the distance between one car and another. The car will automatically speed up, or slow down, to match the speed of the car in front. computers are much safer drivers than people, so cars in a road train will be able to drive much closer together than cars driven by people.
By 2016, Dr. David Davis believes, car technology will give motorists a clear view of the road, whatever the weather conditions, by projecting an image of the road ahead on to the car's windscreen. And by 2020, cars will travel in line, linked to each other electronically. Cars will be connected by an electronic tow bar to the car in front to form ""road-trains"". ""The front vehicle in such a train burns the normal amount.""says Davis. ""but all the others in the train would burn about ten percent of the normal amount,  and so produce about ten percent of the pollution.""",high7629.txt
