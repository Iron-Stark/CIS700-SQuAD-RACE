In 2002, an Australian man went to his friend's 21st birthday party. He got drunk, _ on some steps and cut his lip. He took a picture of his injuries and shared it with his friends on an online forum. ""And sorry about the focus,"" he wrote, ""it was a selfie."" That was the first recorded use of the word ""selfie"", according to linguistic experts at Oxford Dictionaries.
