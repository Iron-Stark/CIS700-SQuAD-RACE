I was sitting in school when I heard the news.
""Your baby brother is born,and wants to see you!""
Dad got me from school and to the hospital with no delay.
Hurrying on our journey,he almost forgot the way!
My brother's hands were tiny,and wrinkly soft, like a prune.
After he smiled at me,Mom said, ""He'll come home soon!""
Everyone ""oohing"" and ""aahing"",they say ""He is so sweet.
And one day he'll walk around on those little baby feet!""",middle7046.txt
