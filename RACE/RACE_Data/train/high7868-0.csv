The most extraordinary thing happened when I was on this walk.
I saw an old man sitting on a chair. He was a seller of second-hand shoes. I thought he looked at least seventy years old. He seemed so tired and nobody was buying his shoes. I wanted to give him something but I had not brought anything with me.
Then, a little girl came toward him. I heard the child say, ""Grandfather, may I polish your shoes?"" That old man took pity on her and he gave her a shoe to polish.
The girl said, ""I polish the shoe because I need money to buy my brother a new school uniform.""
I heard this and tears came to my eyes. The old man answered, ""Oh, little girl. Just stop doing this. Come with me and I will buy you a school uniform."" Then they walked to a market and I followed them behind. There he bought her a school uniform.
The girl said, ""Thank you so much for doing this. May God bless you."" Then she left, leaving the old man smiling.
He walked away from the market, but I stopped him. I whispered in his ear, ""You are a hero! Thank you for your kindness!"" As I walked away, I glanced back and I could see him still smiling.
My own sadness disappeared and was chased away   by the light of this kind act. I began realizing that I have a lot to be thankful for. I hope, some day, I can show my appreciation of what I have by following the example of the old man who only had a little, but shared it beautifully with someone who had nothing.",high7868.txt
