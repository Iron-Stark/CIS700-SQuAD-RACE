Those who have been there say it feels like being robbed of your identity and is as painful as the loss of a loved one.
It may be hard to believe at first, but finally you can use this experience as your advantage--to find another, perhaps even better job, to strengthen your relationship with your family, and to make some much-needed changes in your life. Here are three essential steps.

Once you've got a new job, create your own security. Keep your resume up-to-date, stay in touch with recruiters about the job market, and constantly improve your skills to stay marketable in your field.
Although being laid-off can turn your life upside down, many people say that it gave them push they needed to start a new life!",high14356.txt
