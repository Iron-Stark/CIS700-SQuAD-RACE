High school is a lot like middle school after a while. The first day of course is always scary, and the first day of middle school must have been the same. Of course, the first few days you might get lost while looking for your classes but after a while, what seemed to be a large school really isn't.
One thing that's really cool about high school is that there are so many more classes you can take. If you happen to like art, there are many art classes. In addition, there are other classes that weren't available in middle school like photography or psychology.
In high school, there are a lot of things that are similar to how middle school was but at the same time, there are other opportunities available as well. There are more clubs, sports, and other activities you can join in.
You're able to join in these activities and make new friends with kids with the same interest as you. These activities also give you a chance to learn something you never had the opportunity to learn before.
High school has something for everyone. You just have to decide what to take part in. but there's one thing that's certain that you're going to have just as much fun in high school as you did in middle school. And if middle school wasn't that great for you, high school is a chance to make up for it.
High school isn't just about having fun though. You have to be responsible while you're growing up. Teachers aren't going to chase   you up to do your homework.",high8798.txt
