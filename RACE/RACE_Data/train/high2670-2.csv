That's one of the 50 questions Japanese men could face in a ""daddy exam"", meant to raise awareness about fatherhood in a country where men tend to work long hours and leave their wives in charge of childcare and household work.
Even men who remember Dustin Hoffman struggling as a father in the movie may have a hard time answering questions ranging from baby food to politics.
Tetsuya Ando, director of Fathering Japan, a Tokyo non-profit organization that came up with the test and will offer it to eager dads from next March, said the exam was an attracting way to get fathers into parenting. ""There just isn't enough information about parenting for fathers. Through the exam, we want men to realize that they don't know anything about bringing up kids,"" he said.
