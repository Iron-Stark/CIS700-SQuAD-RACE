1,C,"['was a good husband or father', 'had the right attitude towards her', ""was responsible for her mother's death"", 'did his best to prevent her mother from drinking']",The writer now doesn't think her father  _  .,"Dear Daddy,
You've been gone for six years and I've had time to think. Now I'm ready to write this letter to you.
For a long time after Mom died, I thought I liked her more because I didn't like your attitude and I thought that her softer side was more desirable. In my 15-year-old's mind, I thought you could have stopped my mother from drinking herself to death. Instead, you were off playing tennis and working. Later, I realized that no one could make someone stop drinking. Support is important, but at the end of the day, it is a choice. You were just doing your best.
What I have learned is that I am much like you. You taught me self-confidence. I know if I am prepared to work hard enough for something, I will be successful. This is no small thing. What I've realized since you died is that you were always there for me. You fought to ensure that I got my place on the Quebec badminton team that I had earned. When I got divorced  , you came up to see if I had what I needed to take care of the boys and you paid off my car.
You taught me not to spend money I don't have. I've always kept to that rule. It has served me well. We always had a good home to live in, nice vacations, and everything we needed and most of what we wanted.
You were not a perfect parent and neither am I. My children are much more thankful than I ever was. I am thankful that I had you as my dad. I am still Daddy's girl and I am proud of it.",high11601.txt
