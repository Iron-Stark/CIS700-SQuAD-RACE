2,A,"['Its customers have been drawn away by Citi Bikes.', 'It cannot meet the demand of the bike-share program.', 'Its bike prices have to be lowered again and again.', ""It has to compete with the city's bike rental shops.""]",Why is the bike-share program bad news for Frank's Bike Shop?,"Bright blue Citi Bikes are becoming a fine sight in the New Yorker street. New Yorkers are gradually getting used to more pedaling  passengers on those blue Citi Bikes. But what about local bike shops ? Is City Bike booming at their expense? At Gotham Bikes in Tribeca, a manager who gave his name as ""Ben W."" said the shop has seen an increase in its overall sales due to the bike-share program. ""It's getting more people on the road, more people learning about the sport and getting involved,"" he said. An employee at Danny's Cycles in Gramercy said Citi Bike is a good option for people in a city famed for its traffic jams and aggressive drivers. ""They can try out a bike without buying one:' James Ryan said.
Rentals are not a big part of the business at either Gotham Bikes or Danny's Cycles. But for Frank's Bike Shop, a small business on Grand St., the bike-share program has been bad news. Owner Frank Arroyo said that his rental business has decreased by 90% since Citi Bike was launched last month. Arroyo's main rental customers are European tourists, who have since been drawn away by Citi Bikes.
However, Ben said the bike-share is good for bike sales at his shop. ""People have used the bike-share and realized how great it is to bike in the city, then decide that they want something nicer for themselves,"" he noted.
Christian Farrell of Waterfront Bicycle Shop, on West St. said at first he was concerned about bike-share, though, he admitted, ""I was happy to see people on bikes.""
Farrell's early concerns were repeated by Andrew Crooks, owner of NYC Velo, at 64 Second Ave. ""It seemed like a great idea, but one that would be difficult to put into use:' Crooks said of Citi Bike. He said he worried about inexperienced riders' lack of awareness of biking rules and strong negative reaction from non-cyclists. However, he said, it's still too early to tell if his business has been impacted   .
While it's possible bike-share will cause a drop in business, Crooks agreed that the idea is a positive step forward for New York City.",high11249.txt
