2,C,"['a Chinese who works abroad', 'an expert who works at home', 'an American who works in China', 'a salesman who sells soft wares']",The writer of this passage is probably   _  .,"People at home keep asking me, ""Is it hard to learn Chinese? Why have you learned it so well?"" Well, there's one thing that makes Chinese easy to learn: there are so many people to talk to. You've probably heard that it's the most spoken language. Today it's also one of the most written languages online. And with so many Chinese people interested in learning English, it couldn't be easier to find a friend for language learning. You just have to know where to look for them.
The really good place to look for them is QQ. QQ has the same status  in China as AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) does in the US. It is reported that at any moment, up to 9,000,000 people are using QQ. They're at work, or in a web cafe , or at home, and the information of the users can be found. If you sign on with your address set to ""abroad"", you'll soon find that many thousands of them are interested in speaking to you! This is a great way for you to learn Chinese, and for them to learn English. I think that it's a very interesting way of cultural contact , too, for ordinary people from around the world to be able to have one-on-one contact.",middle2200.txt
