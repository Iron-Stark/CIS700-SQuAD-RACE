3,D,"['Which to buy.', 'What he really needs.', 'Which is nice.', 'How to spell the name of the thing.']",What does Steven stop to think about before he spends any money?,"Steven is six years old. He gets some money from his mother every week. He buys a lot of things from the shops, but he doesn't really need them, and he puts them everywhere. One day his mother gives him a notebook and says, ""Now, Steven, when you buy things, write their names down in the notebook, and also write down how much they are. Then you can look at it again when your money is all gone  , and you don't waste   so much money next time.""
After a week, Steven says to his mother, ""Do you know, Mum, before I spend   any money now, I really stop and think!"" His mother is very happy and thinks, ""Well, my son knows the value   of money now."" But then she hears him say, ""Mum, before I buy something, I always ask myself, 'Can I spell   that word and put it down in my notebook?' """,middle6308.txt
