0,D,"['To invent a new kind of bicycle.', 'To participate in a competition.', 'To satisfy the needs of the public.', 'To add fun to his exercise bike routine*']",Why did Aaron Puzey build the app?,"Riding on an exercise bike at home may keep you in physical shape, but it can get pretty boring after a  while. Aaron Puzey had been on his exercise bike for half an hour a day for years when he decided to look for a way to make it a bit more fun.
With virtual reality technology widely available nowadays, all be needed to do was find a way of applying it to his needs. So he set out to build an app  for the Samsung Galaxy Gear VR headset  which would allow him to hook it up to Google Street view and make it seem like he's cycling through different real-life locations.
Building the app to download the 3D data from Street View and make it viewable in the VR headset was the toughest part of his project. Other than that, all he 
needed to do was tape  a Bluetooth monitor to his exercise bike. Although the quality of the images sometimes leaves a lot to be desired,leaving complex scenes like trees looking like a mess,Aaron has been having a lot of fun on his journey. 
Aaron's project is obviously no substitute (> for real outdoor cycling as it Lacks things like the wind blowing in your face or the pain of battling an uphill climb, bul it has given him a goal, as well as the chance to take in the beauty of places he might have otherwise never seen. It definitely beats staring at a wall or at the TV for 30 minutes, anyway.
Obviously, Aaron's setup theoretically allows him to ride a bike anywhere around the world. He says he ba6 always wanted to see Japan, so once his ride comes to an end, he plans to start another one across the Land of the Rising Sun.",high19739.txt
