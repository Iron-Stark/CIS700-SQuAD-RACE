While relaxing and enjoying the aloneness, I sensed a battle for favorable position between the highly-spirited water and the large rocks resting on the bed along the edges of the stream.
At first; the rocks, stubborn, immovable and unbending, seemed to have their way with their adversary  . However, the water, determined yet forgiving, seemed merely inconvenienced by the presence of the rocks, as it effortlessly changed its course, running towards its original destination.
