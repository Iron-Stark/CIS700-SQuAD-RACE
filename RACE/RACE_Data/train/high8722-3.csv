It is a hard time for them, but it can be an exciting one as well. To make it easier, students need to get familiar with their school.
Even though they've done this already in the middle school, it's still important to find where their classrooms are. Most schools take students to the high school for a visit at the end of their eighth grade year. And, most schools also have a freshman  speech for parents and students before the first year begins. Sometimes the main office will give away a map of the school. This can help students and parents to find different places in the school.
One way to know your high school more and make new friends is to join a club or play a sport. Schools often offer chances to join different clubs and sports. Fall activities begin in August before the first day of school. If you are not interested in sports, there are clubs for any interest, such as drama, dance, chess, photography, community service, etc. These clubs allow students from different grades. By joining an activity, students can find new friendships, not to mention improving their chances in future college applications  . The school office will have a list of activities offered at the school and information on how to join them.
What's more, to have a great start to a high school year, students can write down some of their worries, and ask for help from teachers and school workers.",high8722.txt
