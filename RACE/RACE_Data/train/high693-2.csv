2,B,"['how angry she was', 'how effective she handled Mr. Carr.', 'that she was able to save him', ""that she didn't cry""]",What impressed Alfred most about his mother at the drugstore was  _  .,"The drug store was closing for the night and Alfred Higgins was about to go home when his new boss approached him.
""Empty your pockets please, Alfred,"" Sam Carr demanded in a firm voice.
Alfred pretended to be shocked but he knew he had been caught. From his coat he withdrew a make-up kit, a lipstick and two tubes of toothpaste.
""I'm disappointed in you, Alfred!"" said the little gray-haired man.
""Sorry, sir. Please forgive me. It's the first time I've ever done such a thing,"" Alfred lied, hoping to gain the old man's sympathy.
Mr Carr's brow furrowed as he reached for the telephone, ""Do you take me for a fool? Let's see what the police have to say. But first I'll call your mother and let her know her son is heading to jail.""
""Do whatever you want,"" Alfred shot back, trying to sound big. But deep down he felt like a child. He imagined his mother rushing in, eyes burning with anger, maybe in tears. Yet he wanted to come quickly before Mr. Carr called the police.
Mr. Carr was surprised when Mrs. Higgins finally arrived . She was very calm, quiet and friendly. ""Is Alfred in trouble?"" she asked.
""He's been stealing from the store,"" the old man coolly replied.
Mrs. Higgins pulled out her hand and touched Mr. Carr's arm with great gentleness as if she knew just how he felt. She spoke as if she did not want to cause him any more trouble. ""What do you want to do, Mr.Carr?""
The woman's calm and gentle manner _ the once-angry store-owner, ""I was going to get a cop. But I don't want to be cruel. Tell your son not to come back here again and I will let it go."" Then he warmly shook Mrs. Higgins' hand.
Mrs. Higgins thanked the old ma for his kindness, then mother and son left. They walked along the street in silence. When they arrived home his mother simply said, ""Go to bed, you fool.""
In his bedroom, Alfred heard his mother in the kitchen. He felt no shame, only pride in his mother's actions. ""She was smooth!"" he thought. He went to the kitchen to tell her how great she was, but was shocked by what he saw.
His mother's face looked frightened, broken. Not the cool, bright face he saw earlier. Her lips moved nervously. She looked very old. There were tears in her eyes.
This picture of his mother made him want to cry. He felt his youth ending. He saw all the troubles he brought her and the deep lines of worry in her grey face. It seemed to him that this was the first time he had ever really seen his mother.",high693.txt
