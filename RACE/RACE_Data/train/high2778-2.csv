""Yes, madam,"" said the air hostess and smiled. ""It is right at the other end of the plane---at the front.""
The little lady went too far. She walked all the way to the front of the plane, opened the door in front of her, and saw the captain of the plane and the other officers. They were all busy with their work and did not see her. She went out again, shut the door and returned to the air hostess.
