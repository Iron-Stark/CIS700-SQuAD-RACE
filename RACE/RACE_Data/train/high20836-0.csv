0,D,"['Excited.', 'Disappointed.', 'Appreciative.', 'Disdainful  .']",What's the author's attitude toward the new teacher on the first day?,"The first day my new teacher walked into our school in Spanish Harlem, I burst out laughing. Ron Clark was a young white guy from North Carolina who talked with a funny Southern accent . He said he used to be a singing waiter. I thought, who is this guy? He's a complete joke. 
It was 1999 and I was in the fifth grade at New York City's P.S. 83.  _ . I'd always been a troublemaker. I'd get yelled at, and then the teachers would give up on me. I thought that's what would happen with Ron Clark.
I was wrong. That first week, I kept mocking him. He pulled me out to the hallway and said I'd better shape up. ""Tamara,"" he said, ""you're a smart kid. You can do better.""
He told me I was a natural leader and that I'd go far in life if I started applying myself. I was mad at first, but then something happened: I began to respect him. There were 29 students in our class, and it didn't take long for us to realize that Ron Clark was no ordinary teacher. 
He was only 27 and had the most unusual way of teaching. To help us learn the states and capitals, he changed the lyrics of a popular rap hit called ""Thong Song"" and had us sing and dance with him. When we read the Harry Potter books, he decorated  our classroom like Hogwarts. And during the Presidential election, he put campaign posters on the walls and covered the room with 5,000 red, white and blue stars.",high20836.txt
