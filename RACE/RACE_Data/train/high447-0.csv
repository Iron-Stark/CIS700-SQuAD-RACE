0,D,"['A boy tells his girlfriend how pretty she looks', 'An employee tells his boss how good he is at management', 'A knight is said to be of limitless power by his followers', 'A teacher praised his students for their talent and wisdom.']","Which of the following activities has nothing to do with ""apple-polishing"" ?","An ""apple polisher"" is one who gives gifts to win friendship or special treatment. It is not exactly a bribe ,but is close to it.
All sorts of people are apple polishers, including politicians and people in high offices -- just about everybody. Oliver Cromwell, the great English leader, offered many gifts to win the support of George Fox and his party, but failed.
There are other phrases meaning the same thing as ""apple-polishing"" -- ""soft-soaping"" or ""butter-up"". A gift is just one way to ""soft-soap"" somebody, or to ""butter him up"". Another that is just as effective is flattery, giving someone high praise -- telling him how good he looks, or how well he speaks, or how talented and wise he is.
Endless are the ways of flattery. Who does not love or hear it ? Only an unusual man can resist the thrill of being told how wonderful he is. In truth, flattery is good medicine for most of us, who gets so little of it.
We need it to be more sure of ourselves. It cannot hurt unless we get carried away by it. But we just lap it up for its food value and nourishment, as a cat laps up milk, then we can still remain true to ourselves.
Sometimes, however, flattery will get you nothing from one who has had too much of it. A good example is the famous 12th century legend of King Canute of Denmark and England. The king got tired of listening to the endless sickening flattery of his courtiers .They overpraised him to the skies, as a man of limitless power.
He decided to teach them a lesson. He took them to the seashore and sat down. Then he ordered the waves to stop coming in. The tide was too busy to listen to him. The king was satisfied. This might show his followers how weak his power was and how empty their flattery.",high447.txt
