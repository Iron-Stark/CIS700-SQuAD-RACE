Down by the salley gardens
my love and I did meet;
She passed the salley gardens
with little snow-white feet.
She bid me take love easy,
as the leaves grow on the tree;
But I, being young and foolish,
with her would not agree.
In a field by the river
my love and I did stand,
And on my leaning shoulder
she laid her snow-white  _ .
She bid me take life easy,
as the grass grows on the weirs;
But I was young and foolish,
and now am full of tears.",middle7119.txt
