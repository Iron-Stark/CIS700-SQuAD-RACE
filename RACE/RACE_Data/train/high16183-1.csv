1,A,"['the United States and Canada', 'Canada and Ireland', 'Australia and India', 'Britain and France']","The APIEL is designed for students who want to study in English-speaking countries, such as   _   .","The United States will introduce a new exam system for students who seek to study in the USA and other English-speaking countries, Xinhua News Agency reported from New York.
The exam, which means a great change from the
English level test, was introduced by Theresa Jen, associate director of the International Service of the USA College Board, America's leading educational organization.
""The Advanced Placement International English Language (APIEL) will be offered for the first time all over the world on May 10, 2012,"" said Jen.
However, the APIEL is a strange title to most Chinese students, and it is unlikely to soon gain the similarity of other already existing exams, such as the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language), the GRE (Graduate Record Examination), or the IELTS (International English Language Testing System).
""I have never heard of such a test and I would prefer the IELTS if I need another exam,"" said Xu Jingyan, a graduating student from Beijing University, who wants to study in England and has already taken the TOEFL.
Most of Xu's classmates have never heard of the APIEL.""The APIEL is made for international students who wish to get university studies in English-speaking countries, including the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia."" Jen said.
""The APIEL will be used,"" said Jen, ""because the TOEFL can no longer perfectly show the students' abilities of using English."" Xinhua reported that a large number of foreign students who had high scores in TOEFL exam turned out to be very ordinary educational performers after being admitted.
""Compared with the TOEFL, the APIEL measures a student's ability to read, write, speak and understand 'English through testing his or her skills in listening comprehension, speaking with fluency, and writing in an organized way."" Jen said.",high16183.txt
