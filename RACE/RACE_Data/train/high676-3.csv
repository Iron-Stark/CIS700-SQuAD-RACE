3,B,"['they both disabled people', 'they both had some difficulty in expressing', 'they both liked bus travel', 'they both brought interest to the passengers']",The woman had the same problem with her son in the way that   _  .,"My wife and I used to feel that it was impossible to be a true friend to someone whose name we didn't know. How wrong we were! Years of Sunday-morning bus trips through the city with the same group of ""nameless"" people have changed our thinking. Before the bus takes off, we all join in a conversation: where's the silent woman who sits up front and never responds to our cheery greetings? Here she comes.

And that's not good enough.""The candles flared on our tables. Our fish had never tasted better. But the atmosphere grew pleasant, and when we parted as friends--we shared names.",high676.txt
