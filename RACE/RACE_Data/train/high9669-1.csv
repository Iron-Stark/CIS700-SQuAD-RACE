Do you like animals? Come and volunteer at our cat shelter.
North Toronto Cat Rescue is a no-cage, no-kill cat shelter. We are a volunteer organization, funded totally by donation, and are a licensed Canadian charity.
We are looking for volunteers who can join us once a week for a 3 month period (at least). The work is not wonderful but it is very rewarding. Mainly, we feed, clean, and scoop litter. Of course we also spend quality time with our cats.
We have 2 shifts  per day, 7 days per week:
Mornings are 9am-1pm.
Evenings are 5-7pm or 6-8pm.
Please note that any new volunteer who wishes to work evening shift must be able to work 4 morning shifts on a team before moving to an evening shift. This is required in order to gain the ability to work more independently, as required during evening shifts.
Students must be at least 16 years old. Adults are also welcome.
If you do not have your own personal transportation, please check the public transportation from your area to our location at Bayview/Hwy 7 area before responding to this ad.",high9669.txt
