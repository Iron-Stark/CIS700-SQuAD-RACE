2,A,"['do chores on weekends', 'go to school on weekdays', 'do her homework on weekdays', 'have meals on weekends']",Li Ting doesn't  _  .,"Should teenagers help their parents do chores? Is it important for us to learn how to do chores?
I have a classmate called Li Ting. She is the only child in her family. Her parents love her so much that they don't let her do any chores. On weekdays she gets up, has meals, goes to school, has lessons, she only plays with her friends. So she doesn't know how to do chores. One day, her father was badly ill and was in hospital. Her mother had to take care of her father in the hospital and couldn't cook meals for her for a week. Li Ting didn't know how to cook meals. She had a lot of trouble cooking meals and often felt hungry. She only had instant noodles for her meals.
From the story, we know it's very important for us to learn to do chores.",middle2672.txt
