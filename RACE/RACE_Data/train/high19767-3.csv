3,A,"['Some of the TV channels are not free.', 'All of the TV channels are free', 'None of the TV channels are free.', 'People are not free to choose their favorite programmes.']",Why do people have to pay some money each year?,"One of the first things that Jim discovered while living with the Greens was that there were different television channels in Britain, the BBC broadcasts on two channels: BBC1 and BBC2. There is a mixture of serious and light programmes on BBC1; there are mainly serious programmes on BBC2. ITV is an independent channel which carries advertisements . There are no advertisements on the BBC, so everyone must pay some money to the BBC each year. There are both serious and light programmes on ITV. Because of the different channels, it is not surprising that you often see each member in Mg. Green's house wants to choose his or her own favorite channel. This is the sort of thing you hear:
""There's sports programme on ITV.""
""What's that, children?""
""We were wondering if we could watch the sports programme on ITV.""
""But I was wondering whether to watch the other programme on BBC1."" And so on. The children like ITV; mother prefers BBC1; father prefers BBC2. Jim hasn't made up his mind.",high19767.txt
