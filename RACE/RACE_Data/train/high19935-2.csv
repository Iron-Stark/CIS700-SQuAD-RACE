2,A,"['lasting', 'temporary', 'modest', 'avoidable']",The four-year-old boy's case suggests that the side effects of psychotropic drugs are   _  .,"Many children in foster care  are being over medicated with antipsychotic drugs  they may not really need, or the drugs are being given incorrectly, according to a government review obtained by CBS News.
The report by an Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services looked at concerns surrounding the use of these powerful drugs in children on Medicaid. Many children on Medicaid are in the foster care system.
""Psychotropic drugs are being used in these children, and we don't really know what the side effects are in these young children,"" said CBS News reporter Anna Werner. ""There's not a lot of research because you can't really test these drugs on children.""
More than half the time, the review found children on these powerful drugs were not being monitored adequately. A quarter of them were given the wrong amount of drugs. Many were given too many drugs or took them for too long.
""What the experts tell us is that not enough resources are needed to take care of these kids and give them the treatment that they need -- not drugs,"" Werner said. ""It takes a lot of time and a lot of people to do that, and that of course all costs money."" Therefore, states are choosing to just put kids on drugs instead.
Dr. Fernando Siles, a child psychiatrist  who treats children on Medicaid in Texas and has written thousands of prescriptions for such drugs, told Werner he doesn't have a lot of other options. He said children from troubled homes often have anger and aggression issues and he often prescribes drugs to ""contain"" their behavior so they won't get bounced  from foster home to foster home.
Werner's reporting also turned up the troubling case of a four-year-old boy who was put on four different psychiatric medications in the foster care system. When his grandmother gained custody  a year later, she said the boy seemed like a completely different child since he has taken all the drugs. But he still has frightening dreams at the age of 10.
Werner reports a number of states, including Texas, have taken steps to reduce the use of these drugs in foster children. But experts say more progress is needed, along with greater oversight of the system.",high19935.txt
