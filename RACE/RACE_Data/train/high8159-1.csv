1,D,"['She said nothing.', 'She shouted at him.', 'She called the agent.', 'She threw the phone away.']",What did the author's wife do after she heard his shouting?,"I was waiting for a phone call from my agent. He had left at message the night before, telling me that my show was to be cancelled. I called him several times, but each time his secretary told me that he was in a meeting and that he would call me later. So I waited and waited, but there was still no call. Three hours passing by, I became more and more and impatient. I was certain that my agent didn't care about my work, and he didn't care about me. I was overcome with that thought. I started to shout at the phone, ""Let me wait, will you? Who do you think you are?""
At that time I didn't realize my wife was looking on. Without showing her surprise, she rushed in, seized the phone, tore off the wires, and shouted at the phone, ""Yeah! Who do you think you are? Bad telephone! Bad telephone!"" And she swept it into the wastebasket.
I stood watching her, speechless. What on earth...?
She stepped to the doorway and shouted at the test of the house, ""Now hear this! All objects in this room----if you do anything to upset my husband, out you go!""
Then she turned to me. Kissed me and said calmly, ""Honey, you just have to learn how to take control."" With that, she left the room.
After watching a crazy woman rushing in and out, shouting at everything in sight , I noticed that something in my mood   had changed. I was laughing. How could I have trouble with that phone?
