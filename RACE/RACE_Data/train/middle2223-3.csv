1.Shout out. Shout as loudly as you can, because people may be asleep.
2.Call 119. Never try to put out a fire yourself. Tell 119 where you are and what is on fire.
3.Keep down close to the floor. There is less smoke down there, so it's easier to breathe and see where you are going.
4.Test the door. If the door is cool, open it carefully. If the door is hot, do not open it! Try to find a different way out.
5.Get out. Do not stop to pick up anything. A fire can become very big in a few seconds!
6.Don't use the lift. Always use the stairs. The lift may go wrong and keep you inside.
