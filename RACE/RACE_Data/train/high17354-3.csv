  Tuesday's news said 25-year-old John Smith from England was the man who left the spot quickly after the rescue last Saturday.
  He lifted the little boy out of the water after he fell off the bank. He handed the child to his father, David Anderson, who had dived in after him.
  ""I didn't think at all,"" John told the News. ""It happened very fast. I reacted very fast.""
John, an engineer on vacation, was walking with his girlfriend along the pier when he saw something falling into the water. He thought it was a doll, but realized it was a child when he approached the river. Immediately, he took off his coat and jumped into the water. When he reached the child, he appeared lifeless, he said. Fortunately, when he was out of the water, he opened his eyes.
 Anderson said his son slipped off the bank when he was adjusting his camera. An ambulance came later for him, said John, who was handed dry clothes from onlookers. John caught a taxi with his girlfriend shortly after.
  The rescue happened on the day before he left for England. John said he didn't realize his story had greatly moved Paris until he was leaving the city the next morning.
  ""I don't really think I'm a hero,"" said John. ""Anyone would do the same thing.""",high17354.txt
