1,C,"['He was born in 1958.', 'He went to church because of his father.', 'He once worked in a church.', 'He knew the church well.']",Which of the following statements about the author is NOT true?,"My dad loved pennies, especially those with the elegant stalk of wheat curving around each side of the ONE CENT on the back. Those were the pennies he grew up with during the Depression  .
As a kid, I would go for walks with Dad, spying coins along the way--a penny here, a dime   there. Whenever I picked up a penny, he'd ask, ""Is it a wheat?"" It always thrilled him when we found one of those special coins produced between 1909 and 1958, the year of my birth.
One gray Sunday morning in winter, not long after my father's death in 2002, I was walking down Fifth Avenue, feeling  _ . I found myself in front of the church where Dad once worked. I was warmly shown in and led to a seat. Hearing Dad's favorite ""A Mighty Fortress Is Our God"", I burst into tears. We'd sung that at his funeral.

    The next Sunday, after the service, I was walking up Fifth Avenue and spotted a penny in the middle of a crossing. Oh, no, it was a busy street;cabs were speeding by--should I risk it? I just had to get it.

I found 21 wheat pennies on the streets of Manhattan in the year after my father died, and I don't think that's a coincidence.",high21388.txt
