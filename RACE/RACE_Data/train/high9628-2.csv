Perhaps you've had such experiences like these. Most people have. But most of them haven't realized that they have a memory problem. Neither do they know a simple but important fact: Memory can be improved. If you'll just accept that, the following will show you how.
First, relax. If you are over worried about something, you'll forget it. If you keep telling yourself that your memory is bad, your mind will come to believe it and you won't remember things. When you forget something, don't follow up with saying like ""Oh, my god! I always forget things!"" Such words will have a bad result on you and your memory.
But relaxing isn't enough. To improve your memory, you'll need to take an active role. Like your body, your memory can be made strong through exercise. Look for _ to exercise your memory. For example, if you're learning a language, try to actively remember a lot of new words.
If you don't take notice of things actively, you won't remember them. So, you can make pictures of what you see in your mind every day. For example, don't just put your keys down! If you want to find them again, make a mind picture of the place where you're putting them.",high9628.txt
