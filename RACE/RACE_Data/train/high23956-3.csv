Its aim is to encourage, stimulate and promote authors, poets and wordsmiths by offering fun challenges, a targeted and friendly community and contact network and an interactive forum for critiques, advice, opportunities and self advertising in a fun and informative manner. The website currently receives one thousand visitors a month but with some amazing work being submitted and shared regularly its workers want to increase that number to highlight the talents of aspiring and creative writers across the globe.
Calling all writers: Are you a poet, aspiring author or lover of words? Strictly Shakespeare invites you to join it now. You don't have to write like Shakespeare to enter it. Every month they hold creative writing contests in both poetry and prose based on a theme or prompt and then the TOP TEN finalists are revealed and public voting is open to determine the cash prize winners.
Mission: It is to challenge and stimulate enthusiasts from all over the world and provide a forum to share and create. With thousands of visitors to the website, it is also great advertising for those who take part to earn the recognition they deserve and make contacts and new friends. 
Entries and prizes: It costs only PS1.00 to enter our monthly trysts. It would prefer not to charge at all as they work out of passion as opposed to profit but by charging this minimal fee they can gather all the entry funds, which go into a cash jackpot prize for the winners at the end of each month. Rewards are therefore based upon the number of entries but they give away a minimum of PS20.00 regardless.
How to join: Simply visit the website www.strictlyshakespeare.com today, where you can browse through the amazing submissions of previous winners, take part in the forum or enter into the monthly competitions.
