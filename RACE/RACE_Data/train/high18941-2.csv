Charlie Vansant, a college student of Athens, Ohio, who reported that his car was stolen, got a surprise when he learned that a woman had mistaken it for her daughter's car and driven it home--using her key.
Kate Anderson became an accidental ""car thief"" when picking up her daughter's car near an Ohio University building last week. Anderson found the Toyota Camry   and used her daughter's car key to unlock the car, start the engine and drove it home--without realizing that the car didn't belong to her daughter.
When Charlie Vansant left class a short time later, he found only an empty parking spot. He first assumed the car had been towed  , but when the police couldn't find a record of it, then they took a theft report.
That morning, after Anderson drove the car home, her daughter discovered the Camry in the driveway   wasn't hers. Anderson said she was able to find Vansant's name on the paperwork in the glove compartment and look up his phone number on the website for the university.
When Anderson told Charlie the car was in her driveway, ""It sounded really suspicious   at first, as if she wanted to hold the thing for ransom  ,"" said Vansant. He eventually went to the house with a police officer, where he was reunited with his car. According to the police report, the case was closed ""because of mistaken car identity"", and Anderson wasn't charged.
Vansant blamed the car company more than the ""thief"". ""Her key fit not only my lock, but my ignition   as well--so high-five for Toyota, I guess,"" he said.  (307 words)",high18941.txt
