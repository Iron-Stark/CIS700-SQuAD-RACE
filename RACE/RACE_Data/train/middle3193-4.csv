4,B,"['a dollar bill will be enough to make you happy', 'each of us has been blessed all the time', 'whenever it is, we should choose to help others', 'it is more than money that brings us happiness']",The writer learned from the story that  _  .,"On the way back from work every evening, more often than not there would be a homeless man standing at the exit of the freeway  . He looked to be in his late 40s but was probably a lot younger. He had shoulder length straight black hair and a short beard.
Every day after work I would remember to gather any spare change, and put it aside to give to him if I saw him. A feeling of joy would come over me every time I saw him, while coming off the ramp  . So did he. Sometimes the red light would be on for a minute and we would ask each other about our day. His answer would always be the same, ""I'm blessed!""
Then one day I was called into my boss's office and was told that I was being laid off. For the rest of that day all I could think of was ""how am I going to provide for my kids as a mother, how am I going to pay rent?""
Needless to say that on my way home that day I was very sad and upset. I didn't remember to look for my spare change and keep it ready like I usually did. Yet there he was as always, as I turned the ramp. He set his eyes on me, while still smiling and waving at others as usual.
While I was waiting for the red light to turn, he strolled   over to my car. He had a big smile. He looked at me straight in the eyes and said, ""Today I will give you a dollar."" He then reached into his pocket and pulled out a dollar bill.
You see that day he taught me a valuable lesson more than a dollar bill. No matter what material things are taken from you, no one can take away your choice to be joyful. Every time I'm faced with challenges, I think of the homeless man's valuable lesson and remember that I am blessed.",middle3193.txt
