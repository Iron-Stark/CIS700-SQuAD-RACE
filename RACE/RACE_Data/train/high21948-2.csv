2,D,"[""She didn't think the fire was her fault."", 'She was sad about the house.', 'She got burnt in the fire.', 'She accepted Patch at last.']",What can be inferred about Bryan's mom from the passage?,"In the six months that he'd worked at his aunt's shelter, Bryan had never grown close to a dog, but Patch was different. Aunt Kim had warned him, ""Bryan, your mom says no dogs."" The fact that Patch was deaf did not help.
""It's not your fault you're deaf, ""Bryan said, ""Don't worry, because I've got a plan!"" Later, Bryan got ready to leave. Making sure no one was coming; he secretly put the dog into his bag, and waved his aunt goodbye.
Two hours after arriving home with Patch, Bryan sat sadly in his room. He had told his mother he would take care of Patch, but Mom didn't agree.
Bryan lay awake that night, Patch jumped onto his bed, and soon he fell asleep.
Unbearable barks woke Bryan sometime later. Bryan got up to quiet the dog, but he froze when he saw black smoke snaking into his room. He pulled the door open. Red-yellow flames licked   greedily at the hallway entrance, blocking the front door. Suddenly, Patch ran down the hall. Bryan followed and found the dog in his sister Sarah's room. Bryan pushed Sarah to the window and shouted, ""Jump with Patch!""
Racing back into the smoky hallway, Bryan saw his mom. She seemed hardly able to catch her breath. Bryan tried to drag her to the hall window. But he failed. He looked up just in time to hear voices and feel  _ pull them both to safety.
A neighbor had heard Patch's barks and called 911. The firefighters thought a few candles had caused the fire.
""I can't believe I forgot to blow out my candles,"" Mom said.
""Sorry about the house, Mom,""Bryan said quietly.
To his surprise, Mom smiled. It's OK. The important thing is that our family is safe. ""She patted Patch's head. ""Our whole family.""",high21948.txt
