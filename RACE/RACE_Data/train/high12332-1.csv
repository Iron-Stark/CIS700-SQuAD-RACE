1,C,"['Cheese.', 'Tomato.', 'Mustard.', 'Onion.']",Which of the following is not available for customers to choose from at Louis Lunch?,"Do you love hamburgers? Do you how they were created?
The first hamburgers in U.S. history were served in New Haven, Connecticut, at Louis' Lunch sandwich shop in 1895. Louis Lassen, founder of Louis' Lunch, ran a small lunch wagon selling steak sandwiches to local factory workers. Because he didn't like to waste the excess beef from his daily lunch rush, he ground it up, grilled it, and served it between two slice of bread--and thus America's first hamburger was created.
The small _ is still owned and operated by the third and fourth generations of the Lassen family. Hamburgers are still the specialty of the house, where steak is ground fresh each day and hand molded, slow cooked, broiled vertically, and served between two slices of toast with your choice of only three ""acceptable"" garnishes: cheese, tomato, and onion.
Want ketchup or mustard? Forget it. You will be told ""no"" in no uncertain terms. This is the home of the greatest hamburger in the world, claim the owners, who are perhaps best known for allowing their customers to have a burger the Lassen way or not at all.",high12332.txt
