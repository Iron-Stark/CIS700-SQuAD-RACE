2,C,"['Bad', 'Lonely', 'Kind', 'Different']",How did the monster describe himself in the advertisement?,"Once upon a time there was a monster(  ). He was very ugly (  ), and had no friends. No one wanted to talk to him. Even other monsters thought he was ugly. He lived alone and was very unhappy because he was so lonely.
""I wish I had a friend."" he said to himself every day. ""One friend would be enough. Someone to talk to.""
""Dear Editor( )."" he wrote. "" I am an ugly monster. How can I find a friend?""
""Dear Monster."" the Editor replied. "" Advertise( )for a friend in this magazine."" The monster wrote an advertisement.
""Monster wants a friend, male or female. I have two heads, four arms, six legs and three tails. I have one blue eye, one green eye and one brown eye. Smoke comes out of my noses. But I am really a kind monster and will be a good friend to someone. If you would like to meet me, please stand outside Blake's Store at 6 p.m. on Friday, May 22nd. Write to me at Box 45. Everybody's Magazine.""
A few days later he went to the magazine.
""Do you have any letters for Box 45?"" he asked.
The Editor looked in Box45.
""Yes, there is one."" she said, and gave it to him.
The monster opened the letter, and read, ""Dear Monster, I think a person's character ( ) is more important than his appearance( ). I will wait outside Blake's Store on Friday. Please carry a flower so that I will recognize you. Yours sincerely, Alice Green. """,middle4201.txt
