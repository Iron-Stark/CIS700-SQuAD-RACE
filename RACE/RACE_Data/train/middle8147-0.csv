0,B,"['Because he needed to get ready for trip.', 'Because he needed to catch the early bus.', 'Because his mother was ill.', 'Because it was his first day to work.']",Why did the writer need to get up at six a.m. the next morning?,"I went to bed at 11pm, it was snowing. I slept deep and my clock didn't work. It was so cold that I didn't want to get up again. I called my mother ""Mom, my alarm clock is dead, but tomorrow morning I need to get up at six o'clock to catch an early bus . Can you give me a wakeup call?"" My mother's voice was a little dull, ""Fine, dear.""
Phone rings pulled me out of my dreams. Mom said from the other end of the line,""It is time to get up, and you need to catch the early bus."" I looked at my watch-5:40.""Didn't I ask you to wake me up at SIX?"" I complained.""Let me have some more sleep, please!""
I got up and ready for the trip. It was a dark, cold morning, and everywhere was filled with snow. As I reached the bus stop, I found a white-haired couple  had already been waiting. ""You see, you didn't sleep at all night and got here so early,"" the man murmured( ) to his wife.
The bus finally came. The driver was a very young man. He waited just long enough for me to get on before he started the bus again. ""Please wait,"" I said to the driver. ""There are two older people that need to get on, too. It is so cold, and they have waited for a long time. How could you leave them behind?""
Without stopping the bus, the young driver said""That's OK, they are my parents. This is my first day on the job, so they came to make sure I was all right.""
I couldn't hold back my tears. My mobile phone rang, incoming was my father's message, ""Sweetie, your mom is not feeling well, she was awake most of the night so that she wouldn't miss your wakeup call.""
The wakeup call, the older couple, the young driver...reminded me of a Jewish proverb:
""When a father gives something to his son, the son smiles; when a son gives something to his father, the father cries.""",middle8147.txt
