2,B,"['Optimistic', 'Skeptical', 'Supportive', 'Objective']",The tone of the passage is best described as  _  .,"Picture a library without books? Well, I can't. Ever since I was little I would go to the library and take out numerous books. From picture books to beginning chapter books to YA books, books have always been a part of my life. Unlike many people today, I don't own a Kindle or a Nook or any type of e-reader. I prefer the old-fashioned book. There is something about holding a book and being able to turn the pages that I find comforting. In today's 21st century, books may become _ . For me that's something I find scary.
I am a fan of the old TV science-fiction series Twilight Zone. One episode is about a librarian who has become obsolete. _

Additionally, our society is becoming increasingly lazy. For instance, instead of doing mental math, people use their phone to solve 89 + 74.
