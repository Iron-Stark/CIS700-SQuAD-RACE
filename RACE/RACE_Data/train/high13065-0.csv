0,D,"['Because the pole was on fire.', 'Because her cat was missing.', 'Because she felt it was strange.', 'Because she wanted to save the cat.']",Why did the woman call the fire station ?,"""I honestly have no idea how that cat got up there.It's a hundred--foot--metal pole.There's no way he climbed that thing,""Jim said to the worried woman.It wasn't even her cat,but she was passing by and saw it.immediately calling the fire--station to come to save it.Jim saw a lot of strange things as a fireman,often sad or upsetting things,but this was new.
""I suppose we could get the blanket and see if we can convince the poor cat to jump down* But he doesn't really look too scared...""Jim said to the woman.
""Dave,get over here!"" Jim called over his shoulder to the fire truck driver.Dave walked over and looked where Jim was pointing.
""How'd he get up there?""
Jim shrugged,similarly puzzled.""Do you suppose we could get the blanket and convince him to jump?""
Dave shrugged in response.""I don't see why not.""
Jim looked up at the black mass on the top of the flagpole,the American nag waving proudly beneath _ .It was definitely a cat,and he regarded the people gathered below as if they were his subjects and he their king,his yellow eyes scanning his surroundings with apparent disinterest.
When the blanket was spread out below the cat,Jim and Dave began striking the flagpole.The cat looked down,and then gazed into the sky as if it were looking for something.Jim and Dave followed his gaze.Suddenly,out of the clear sky,appeared a dark figure.The figure swooped low toward the flagpole.It was an eagle! As it got closer,the cat leaped down the pole swiftly onto the ground,and then got lost in the bushes.
Jim,Dave,and the old woman were left with their mouths open.They all agreed it was the best way to get it down.",high13065.txt
