1,C,"['People got hurt in this programme.', 'Li Yuchun was invited in this programme.', 'The programme showed no respect for animals.', 'The programme is making wild animals decline rapidly.']",Why WAZA is not pleased with Wonderful Friends?,"The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) is an international organization that brings together zoos and aquariums to cooperate in efforts to advance the respectful, humane  treatment of animals in our care, and to support the conservation of animals across the globe.
WAZA was shocked and disappointed to learn of the inappropriate and damaging content in the new TV show Wonderful Friends, jointly produced by China's biggest zoo & circus company (Chimelong) and one of China's top TV companies (Hunan TV). The show dresses up chimpanzees in human clothes and markets them as ""cute pets"". The animals are placed in many stressful and harmful situations, in order to create ""entertaining"" story lines. It is disappointing to note that Chinese pop singer and actress Li Yuchun took part in this show, helping to popularize these misleading and inhumane practices. In one example, a young chimp bit an actress in the face right next to a zoo visitor, and then bit another actor leaving a wound on his hand.
WAZA is strongly against practices and shows of this nature. Animals presented in such cruel and unnatural surroundings cannot contribute to serious conservation efforts. Presenting chimpanzees in unnatural and anthropomorphic  settings suggests to viewers that they are not endangered and make great pets. Such shows are not only disrespectful to animals, they also lack any sort of conservation purpose.  According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, chimpanzees are now considered endangered, and wild populations are declining rapidly.  WAZA recognizes that the growing popularity of television programmes such as Wonderful Friends can only increase the already-huge existing demand for chimpanzees as pets.
WAZA requests the following:
(1) The immediate cancel of this programme and similar shows wherever they may take place;
(2) That all animals held in captivity  be provided with the highest level of care;
(3) That under no circumstances should chimpanzees be imported from the wild just for entertainment purposes.",high19430.txt
