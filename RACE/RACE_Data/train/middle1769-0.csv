0,B,"['Some frogs.', 'The date of World Wetlands Day.', '1971', 'Any special day.']",What should you put in your diary?,"Put 2 February in your diary! It is World Wetlands Day! It marks the date that the
Convention  on Wetlands was signed in1971.This special day was first celebrated in 1997 and it is celebrated every year.
The celebration is a call for action. It is a way to show people how important and
useful the wetlands are for people. On World Wetlands Day, people around the world take
part in many wetlands activities. People take trips to the local wetlands. There are talks
about how important the wetlands are. People get together to clean up their local wetlands
Children draw pictures to advertise the day. People also compete in boat races.
The World Wetlands Day is important! If there are no wetlands, there will be no water for anyone in the future. Wetlands help protect nature and resources like fresh water. Already,  more than 10000 million people in the world do not have fresh water.
Many people do not know how important the wetlands are. They can understand why an
elephant or a tiger is important because they are big, beautiful animals. It is much harder for
them to understand how important the animals in the wetlands are. These small animals,
such as frogs and snails, play a very important part in keeping the balance of nature.
All plants and animals are part of the food chain .If the small wetlands animals
die, some animals in the food chain will have nothing to eat. They will also die. People
need the wetlands to keep the balance of nature in the world. If we do not protect nature
today,it will be gone tomorrow.",middle1769.txt
