3,B,"['The bat is the only flying animal in the world.', 'The bat has poor eyesight, but it can ""see"" its food.', 'Not all bats are afraid of flying in the sun.', 'The bat often comes out in the daytime.']",Which of the following is True?,"Bats are the only flying mammal  in the world. They can't see very well. It is long believed, in many places, that all bats are blind . ""Blind as a bat"" is often heard.
Yet they have no trouble flying in the darkest nights and finding their way around. How can bats fly and see at night? They fly by radar  .
The bat's radar system works the same way as the one that ships and planes use. When a bat flies through the air, it makes sounds that people can't hear. If the sounds hit things, they will come back. The bat's ears can receive the messages. In this way it can know where the things are.
Bats go out to look for food at night. In the daytime they stay in some dark places. Some people think bats are bad animals. In fact, they are useful animals.",middle5949.txt
