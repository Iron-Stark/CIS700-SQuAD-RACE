3,A,"['a person with special ability', 'a person with no learning at all', 'a person who can do nothing', 'a person who can do everything well']","In this passage the word ""genius"" means   _  .","School and Einstein did not mix well. His teachers thought that he was stupid and that Einstein's thoughts and words were jumbled . His schoolwork was poor. Playing the violin was all he was good at as a child.
When he was ten, he met Dr. Max Talmy. Talmy talked with the boy and tried to help him. They discussed books and Einstein showed an interest in maths. He understood difficult problems and ideas. Inside this ""stupid"" boy was a genius.
Schoolwork never became easy for Einstein. He could not learn things by heart. Paying attention was hard for him. He even did not passed his first test to enter college.
Because of his learning problems, Einstein made few friends. He was shy in groups of people. Yet he overcame his shortcomings. He became a well-known scientist in the field of physics. He was one of the most important thinkers of the modern age.",high19079.txt
